Information from the central distribution of essential medicines and the receipts of antimicrobial prescriptions were used.There were 2,232 prescription receipts analyzed, in which metronidazole (250 mg) was prescribed in 28% of the evaluated prescription receipts, the \"pill\" pharmaceutical form in 30.7%, and the \"oral\" administration form in 78.2%. In the prescriptions prescribed by nurses, 80.7% were intended for users with sexually transmitted infections. With the exception of the pharmaceutical form, only 34.7% of the prescriptions were in accordance with the Nursing protocol recommendations. There is still no information on the concentration (43.7%), the dosage (39.9%) and the treatment time (36.8%).The evaluated receipts of antimicrobial prescriptions do not accurately follow the guidelines of Resolution No. 20/2011, nor of the instituted Nursing protocol.",
