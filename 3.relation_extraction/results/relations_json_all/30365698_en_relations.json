The molluscs were captured and taxonomically identified and examined for S. mansoni cercariae.the work was carried out in 427 municipalities (99.5% of the 429 selected); the presence of mollusks was registered in 300 (70.2%) municipalities; Biomphalaria glabrata were found in 62 (21%) municipalities, B. straminea in 181 (60%), B. tenagophila in three (1%); B. glabrata/B. straminea association was found in 53 municipalities (18%) and B. glabrata/B. tenagophila association in one (0.3%) municipality.B. glabrata, B. straminea and B. tenagophila distribution records obtained in this study are consistent with previously known distribution.",
