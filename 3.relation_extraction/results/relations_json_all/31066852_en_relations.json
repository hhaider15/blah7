    "text": "Rio de Janeiro maintains a recurrent history of dengue epidemics. There is scarce evidence about the route of the population to get health care. The study aimed to describe the pattern of suspected dengue patients flow in search of health care services in Rio de Janeiro. The following data were analyzed: dengue reports from 2011 to 2013; the neighborhoods of patient's residence; the neighborhoods of health services. Neighborhoods of the city were used as unit of analysis focusing on access to health facilities of municipal Planning Area (AP) 3.3. Flow maps were elaborated to describe the routes between the neighborhood of residence and the heath service. Between 2011 and 2013 48,576 suspected dengue cases living in program area 3.3 were reported, 72% got health care in the AP 3.3, 37% of which in primary care. A total of 12,545 suspected cases attended health facilities outside the AP 3.3. A great geographical variation was observed in the search for Primary Care within the AP 3.3, as well as a relevant movement to the center and south zone of the city on access to care, comprising 2,647 different flows. The findings indicate a large flow within the municipality.",
