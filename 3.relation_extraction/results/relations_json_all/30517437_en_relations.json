    "text": "To analyze the structure of primary health care for the detection of tuberculosis cases in two municipalities of Rio Grande do Sul.Descriptive, evaluative mixed methods research, with direct observation of the physical structure of 69 primary health care units; and semi-structured interviews with 10 subjects. Conducted between 2014 and 2016. Using descriptive statistics and content analysis for data analysis.In the 50 units in Pelotas there was an absence of: pots (24%); forms (53.1%), register books (48%) and of transportation of material to the laboratory (86%). In the 19 units of Sapucaia do Sul, these inputs were available. The absence of professionals, the turnover of human resources and the lack of training, emerged as the main structural deficiencies.There are structural differences between municipalities. The study suggests that Pelotas should adopt tuberculosis care coordination.",
