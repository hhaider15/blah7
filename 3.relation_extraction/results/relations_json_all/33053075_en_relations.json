The functional scale of swallowing used for assessment was the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association National Outcome Measurement System (ASHA NOMS).the results indicate that there was a significant recovery of the functional swallowing patterns when comparing the measurements pre and post swallowing intervention.83% of the patients needed up to 3 swallowing interventions to recover a safe swallowing pattern.",
