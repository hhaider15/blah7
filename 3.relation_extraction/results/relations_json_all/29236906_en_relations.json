    "text": "To compare vocal and acoustic parameters of HIV-infected children and non-HIV-infected children.Vocal samples were submitted to auditory-perceptual and acoustic analysis. Samples of the sustained vowel /\u03b5/ and continuous speech of 74 children between 6 and incomplete 12 years old were analyzed, divided into two groups: 37 HIV-infected children (GHIV) and 37 non-HIV-infected children, the control group (CG), age and gender-matched and without previous vocal evaluation; they were all prepubescent by the Tanner Stages (MS, 2014). The children had their voices recorded and analyzed by VoxMetria 5.1, in the period between 2014 and 2015. The auditory-perceptual analysis assessed the overall degree of the vocal quality and was performed using a 100-point visual analogue scale, transformed into a 4 point numerical scale (0 = no vocal deviation and 4 = severe vocal deviation). The acoustic evaluation was based on the analysis of the vocal sample distribution in the Phonatory Deviation Diagram (PDD). The research was approved by the Ethics Committee under the number 122.746.In the auditory-perceptual analysis, most children of both groups were evaluated as with no vocal deviation. No difference between the groups was found in the acoustic analysis using the PDD; most voice samples were within the normality area, in the quadrant 1, with a spread density distribution and a vertical shape.HIV-infected children presented similar vocal quality to children without the illness, both for the perceptual-auditory and acoustic evaluation.",
