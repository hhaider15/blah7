Data were collected from medical records and investigation forms.Thirty-three elderly patients participated in this study. A prevalence of dengue was observed, with fever, myalgia, and arthralgia. Arterial hypertension and diabetes were the comorbidities. Statistically significant correlations were obtained between arbovirus and schooling, employment situation, marital status, test results, and use of analgesics; and between the site of arthralgia and Chikungunya.The results support nursing care to hospitalized elderly patients with arbovirus, allowing the development of a proper and humanized care plan.",
