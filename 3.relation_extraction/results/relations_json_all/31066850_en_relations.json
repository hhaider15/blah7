    "text": "This study aimed to describe the main entomological triatomine-related indicators in the western mesoregion of Rio Grande do Norte. This is a descriptive cross-sectional retrospective study developed on a historical analysis of information on the triatomine capture carried out by the Chagas Disease Control Program, from 2008 to 2013. Five species were captured, of which the Triatoma brasiliensis and Triatoma pseudomaculata, by occupying the domestic and peridomestic environment, sequentially, and Panstrongylus lutzi by the highest rate of natural infection. A prevalence of nymphs among the captured specimens, a higher triatominal density in the peridomicile, infestation, colonization and natural infection rates of 5.6%, 49.6% and 0.8%, respectively, a significant difference in the distribution of specimens between the municipalities investigated and lack of declining infestation and colonization rates between 2009 and 2012 was observed. Findings suggest the need for continuous surveillance, facilitated by the association between field teams and communities, with emphasis on the proposal of health education for the recognition and notification of triatomines by the population.",
