    "text": "To analyze the concept of patient discharge in leprosy.Theoretical study guided in the methodological framework of concept analysis. A bibliographical survey was held from December 2015 to January 2016 using the following bases: SCOPUS, CINAHL, PubMed, LILACS, SCIELO and BDENF, by use of the descriptors \"Leprosy\" and \"Patient Discharge\", resulting in 13 studies.The following were identified as possible uses for the concept: discharge by cure, drug use discharge, bacteriological discharge and post-discharge. The attributes defined were completion of multidrug therapy, completion of multidrug therapy for paucibacillary leprosy, completion of multidrug therapy for multibacillary leprosy and cure from leprosy. The presence of an M. leprae infection, symptoms present in skin and peripheral nerves, diagnosis and treatment and leprosy reactions were identified as antecedents. Consequents were exclusion from the active leprosy record and continuity of health care. One case model and one opposing case were presented.The analysis broadened the concept \"discharge in leprosy\", providing other meanings than the clinical definition of multidrug therapy.",
