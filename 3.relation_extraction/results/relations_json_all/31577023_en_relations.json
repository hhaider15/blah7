    "text": "The aim of this study was to assess toxoplasmosis knowledge and preventive behavior, and relate these to socioeconomic, pre-natal and environmental issues among pregnant women served by the Family Health Strategy in the municipality of Imperatriz, Maranh\u00e3o, Brazil. This is a cross-sectional study performed by applying a structured and pre-tested questionnaire to a sample of 239 pregnant women. Only 23.4% of the pregnant women had good knowledge of the disease, primarily in the area of prevention, and 58.9% adopted suitable preventive behaviors. The results obtained show a significant association of various toxoplasmosis risk factors, such as drinking untreated water (OR = 2.1245; IC95% = 1.20-3.73; p = 0.0128), contact with cats (OR = 7.6875; IC95% = 4.22-13.97; p < 0,0001), cleaning cat feces (OR = 6.8738; IC95% = 3.02-15.60; p < 0.0001), eating raw meat (OR = 5.7405; IC95% = 3.21-10.24 and handling sand/cat litter OR = 10.7376; IC95% = 4.64-24.85; p < 0.0001). This shows a need for continued education on toxoplasmosis for the pregnant women seen by the Imperatriz FHS, and for more comprehensive preventive measures, with public health and education policies that take into consideration economic, social, environmental and cultural issues.",
