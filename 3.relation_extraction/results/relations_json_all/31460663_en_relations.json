    "text": "Tocantins is the most hyperendemic state for leprosy in Brazil.To describe the epidemiological characteristics and temporal trends of leprosy indicators in children under 15 years old in Tocantins between the years of 2001 and 2012.Data analysis of the Notification of Injury Information System (SINAN). New cases under the age of 15 have been included in the state. The indicators were calculated and the temporal trends were analyzed through the join-point regression.There were 1,225 cases in children, mean age of 10.8 years, and male predominated (52%). The mode of detection by spontaneous demand prevailed (55.8%) and more than 9% had some physical disability. Detection in < 15 years was significantly increased between 2001 and 2008 (anual percent change - APC = 3.8%; confidence interval of 95% - 95%CI 0.1 - 7.6), and showed significant decline between 2008 and 2012 (APC = -9.4%; 95%CI -17.2 - -0.8). There was stability for the detection of grade 2 cases (APC = 4.2%; 95%CI -6.7 - 16.3), proportion of grade 2 cases (APC = 4.1%; 95%CI 6.7 - 16.3), proportion of grade 1 cases (APC = 1.3%; 95%CI -6.2 - 9.3), multibacillary ratio (APC = 2.9%; 95%CI -1.7 - 7.7), and proportion of paucibacillary (APC = 2.9%; 95%CI -1.7 - 7.7).Leprosy remains an important public health problem in Tocantins, with active transmission and persistence of transmission foci. The stability of the indicators points out the permanence of the late diagnosis and the repressed demands.",
