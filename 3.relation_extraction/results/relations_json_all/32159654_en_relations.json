    "text": "The WHODAS 2.0 (World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule) is an instrument developed by the WHO (World Health Organization) for functioning and disability assessment based on the biopsychosocial framework, fully supported by the theoretical-conceptual framework of the ICF (International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health). To validate the Brazilian version of the WHODAS 2.0 for individuals with HIV/AIDS. 100 individuals with diagnosis of HIV/AIDS participated in the study. Two assessment instruments were used: the 36-item version of WHODAS 2.0 and the WHOQOL-HIV-BREF (World Health Organization Quality of Life assessment in persons infected with HIV, shorter version). The psychometric properties tested were internal consistency and criterion validity. Internal consistency was adequate for all domains, with the exception of Life Activities (\u03b1 = 0.69) and Self-care (\u03b1 = 0.32). Criterion validity was adequate, with moderate correlations between the WHODAS 2.0 and the WHOQOL-HIV-BREF domains. The results indicated the WHODAS 2.0 instrument as a valid tool for assessing functioning of individuals with HIV/AIDS. The use of data from the Self-care domain should be carefully considered.",
