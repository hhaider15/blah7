Data were obtained from individuals declared in the Mortality Information System (SIM), notified in the Notification of Injury Information System - SINAN or Tuberculosis Special Treatment Information System - SITETB from 2007 to 2013.Evidence indicates association between sociodemographic inequalities and occurrence of tuberculosis in the population.
