Data was collected through the semi-structured interview and content analysis was carried out.Two categories emerged: Knowledge and execution of self-care practices in Leprosy and Singularities and challenges for self-care. The study found that respondents are familiar with information about face, hand and foot care, but report difficulties such as low income to acquire material for self-care, lack of time, and some lack of interest. Most of them already presented a degree of incapacity.The training of professionals who work on the empowerment of people facing the disease, guidelines on prevention of disabilities and access to inputs for carrying out self-care are necessary.",
