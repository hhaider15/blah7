    "text": "The objective of this study was to analyze in the literature how the applications were developed and how they influence the prevention of Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs). PubMed, CAPES Periodicals and Bireme databases were searched using the descriptors sexually transmitted diseases and mHealth combined by the Boolean connector AND. The search considered studies published between 2013 to 2017 available online in Portuguese and English. The results of the studies showed formative research was the most used method and focus group was the most used technique for data collection in the development of an application. This technique aims at the exchange of experience and allows discussion about issues inherent to infections. The applications were built with methodological rigor with the participation of users and with instructional resources that influence the management of the prevention and control of infections.",
