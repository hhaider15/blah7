    "text": "To analyze sexual and reproductive health indicators of adolescents based on data from the National School-based Health Survey (PeNSE) in 2015, comparing them to the data from 2009 and 2012.Cross-sectional study that has analyzed data from 9th grade students from PeNSE 2015, 2012 and 2009. We estimated prevalence and 95% confidence intervals for the following indicators: sexual initiation, condom use in the last sexual intercourse, counseling for pregnancy, sexually transmitted infections and free condoms in the three rounds of the survey. Prevalence of all indicators accessed in 2015 was estimated according to sex, type of school and region. Pearson's \u03c72 test was used.The prevalence of sexual initiation reported by adolescents has decreased from 30.5%, in 2009, to 27.5%, in 2015, as well as the use of condom in the last intercourse, from 75.9 to 66.2%, respectively. In respect to counseling, there was a reduction regarding pregnancy prevention in public schools, from 81.1 to 79.3% and in relation to free condom in private schools, from 65.4 to 57.3%. About 30% reported using both condom and another contraceptive method, and 19.5% did not use any method. Boys presented greater prevalence of sexual initiation, higher number of partners and reduced prevalence of condom use. Adolescents living in North, Northeast and Central-West regions presented worse indicators.There was a reduction in sexual initiation and condom use among Brazilian adolescents, boys were more vulnerable to sexually transmitted infections, and girls from public schools were more vulnerable to pregnancy.",
