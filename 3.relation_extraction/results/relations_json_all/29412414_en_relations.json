    "text": "This study analyzes the reported cases of syphilis in pregnant women and the possible outcomes for fetuses and the newborn in Fortaleza, Cear\u00e1. It is a cross-sectional study that analyzed 175 reported cases of syphilis in pregnant women matched with the corresponding reports of congenital syphilis during the years 2008-2010. Descriptive statistics with absolute and relative frequencies, central tendency and dispersion measures, and the Pearson's chi-square test were used to analyze the statistical significance using the p-value <0.05. Sociodemographic variables of pregnant/postpartum women, the assistance provided to newborns and the outcome of cases were analyzed. The results showed the occurrence of syphilis in young women with more than 85% of inappropriate treatment, 62.9% of untreated sexual partners or lack of statistics and high percentages of non-realization of the recommended tests for congenital syphilis investigation in children. Among the fetuses, five were stillborn, one miscarried and there were three neonatal deaths. The lack of adequate treatment of pregnant women may be associated with morbidity and mortality of fetuses, maintaining this infection as a burden on the list of public health problems.",
