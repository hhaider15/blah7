    "text": "to evaluate the main risk factors for postoperative complications in patients undergoing appendectomy for acute appendicitis.we retrospectively analyzed 1241 patients undergoing open or laparoscopic appendectomy. Patients were allocated to four groups: Group 1, without postoperative complications, and Groups 2, 3, and 4, with postoperative complications defined according to their severity, following Clavien-Dindo classification (I, II, and \u2265III, respectively).patients aged \u226538.5 years had more severe complications (p<0.0001). Patients in Group 1, without postoperative complications, had, for the most part, a laparoscopic approach. Groups 2, 3, and 4 underwent, predominantly, to an open surgery (p<0.0001). In cases of acute appendicitis, the odds ratio (OR) for complications was 3.09, 3.04, and 12.41 for Groups 2, 3, and 4, respectively (p<0.0001). Anesthetic risk, duration of the procedure, and length of hospital stay were related to a higher risk and severity of complications.the main predicting factors of postoperative complications in patients operated for acute appendicitis were: age \u226538.5 years, conventional or open surgical access, complicated appendicitis, ASA\u22652, and surgical time >77 minutes.",
