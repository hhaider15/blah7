    "text": "To evaluate knowledge and behavior of professionals in Intensive Care Units regarding the actions recommended in the bundle on preventing central venous catheter-related bloodstream infection.Cross-sectional descriptive quantitative study, conducted in three Intensive Care Units. The data were collected through a face-to-face questionnaire applied to health professionals. The software R 3.3.1 was used for data analysis.Two-hundred and ninety-two professionals participated. Regarding knowledge, the hand hygiene item presented a higher level both for the insertion (92.46%) and maintenance (97.27%) moments. Usage of chlorhexidine as an antiseptic, followed by alcohol (47.94%) and providing a date for hub or connectors (19.87%) were the least known items. As for behavior, the professionals reported: using always the correct attire for catheter insertion (84.25%), never waiting for the antiseptic to dry before catheter insertion (25.34%) and never cleaning hub or connectors with 70% alcohol (23.86%).Results show that the professionals' knowledge and behavior regarding the central venous catheter bundle present deficiencies, revealing the importance of promoting training programs for this knowledge domain.",
