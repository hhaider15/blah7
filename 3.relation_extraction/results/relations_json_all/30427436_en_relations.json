    "text": "Cape Verde is an archipelago on the African coast, with 538,535 inhabitants living on nine islands. Since it gained independence in 1975, the country has experienced rapid economic and social growth, with significant gains in education as well as a reduction in maternal and infant mortality deaths. In 2001, following the guidelines of the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD, Cairo, 1994), the National Reproductive Health Program (PNSR) was launched aiming to provide sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services to adolescents, young people and adult men, in partnership with the education sector and youth centers. However, the continuance of unplanned pregnancies, illegal abortions and HIV infections has indicated that there are gaps in the program`s implementation. Studies conducted in the country point to socio-cultural aspects as well as aspects covering organizations and the services on offer, as some of the reasons for the identified problems. This paper aims to reflect on the scope and limits of the PNSR in Cape Verde with consideration being given to the challenges of implementing health policies that affect cultural practices related to gender and sexuality. Consideration is also given to the specifics of Cape Verde`s demographics, economic and cultural aspects as well as the importance of the SRH services to its development.",
