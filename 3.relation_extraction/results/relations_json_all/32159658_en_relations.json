    "text": "This article aims to understand the social representations of masculinities in the campaign by the Ministry of Health on Combined Prevention/2016, from the short film \"AIDS, choose your form of prevention\". An exploratory, qualitative approach was conducted at the AIDS Portal, Sexually Transmitted Infections and Viral Hepatitis, Department of Sexually Transmitted Infections, AIDS and Viral Hepatitis. The results pointed out five organizing categories of social representations about masculinities. It was concluded that the social representations of masculinity in the short film reproduced hegemonic values of the masculine social role.",
