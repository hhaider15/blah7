    "text": "Linkage is a critical step in the ongoing care of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV/aids) infection and is essential for providing access to antiretroviral therapy, as well as comprehensive care.Cross-sectional study on people living with HIV (PLHIV), aged \u2265 18 years old, linked between January and December 2015, in a referral service for outpatient and hospital care specialized in HIV/AIDS in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais. Linkage time was defined as the time from diagnosis to service linkage. Timely care linkage was considered when this time was \u2264 90 days. Data were collected through clinical records. A logistic regression analysis with a confidence interval of 95% (95%CI) was performed.Among 208 patients, most of them were males (77.8%) with a mean age of 39 years. About 45% presented AIDS-defining conditions at the moment of linkage. Linkage time presented a mean of 138 \u00b1 397 days. And timely linkage occurred for 76.9% of the patients. The variables associated with timely care linkage were: age \u2265 48 years (odds ratio - OR = 8.50; 95%CI 1.53 - 47.28), currently working (OR = 3.69; 95%CI 1.33 - 10.25) at the time of linkage, and present CD4+ T lymphocyte count (CD4+ T) \u2264 200 cells/mm3 at the time of HIV diagnosis (OR = 4.84; 95%CI 1.54 - 15.18). There was an important proportion of timely care linkage among PLHIV, but with late diagnosis.Interventions should be targeted at younger people with higher CD4+ T lymphocyte counts, in order to better provide continuous HIV care.",
