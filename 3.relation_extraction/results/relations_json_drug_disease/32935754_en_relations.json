In the prescriptions prescribed by nurses, 80.7% were intended for users with sexually transmitted infections. With the exception of the pharmaceutical form, only 34.7% of the prescriptions were in accordance with the Nursing protocol recommendations. There is still no information on the concentration (43.7%), the dosage (39.9%) and the treatment time (36.8%).The evaluated receipts of antimicrobial prescriptions do not accurately follow the guidelines of Resolution No. 20/2011, nor of the instituted Nursing protocol.",
