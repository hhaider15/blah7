    "text": "At age 44, after suffering a breakdown in Turin, philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche was diagnosed with neurosyphilis. There was no necropsy on his body, so this medical diagnosis has been questioned over the time. We conducted a literature review on the medical diagnosis of Nietzsche, which emphasizes three genres of pathographies that emerged successively as alternatives explanations for Nietzsche's breakdown in Turin: (1) narratives about syphilis (\"demoniac-pathological\"); (2) narratives about functional psychosis (\"heroic-prophetic\"); (3) other narratives about organic diseases, other than syphilis (\"scientific-realistic\"). The latter - which correspond to our study object in this work - undertake retrospective diagnostics, attempting to retrieve the \"truth\" underlying the disease and elucidate \"Nietzsche's affair\". We inquire this detective-like impetus, currently taken to the extreme by \"evidence-based medicine\", and we denounce its anachronism. Syphilis has become a scientific fact only after the death of Nietzsche. We conclude that the diagnosis he received is shown to be consistent with the nineteenth-century medical rationality and the syphilis status as a cultural fact at that time.",
