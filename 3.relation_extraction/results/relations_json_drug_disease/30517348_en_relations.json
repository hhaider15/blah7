    "text": "to analyze the impact of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV10) on pneumonia hospital admissions among children in Santa Catarina, Brazil, 2006-2014.this was an ecological study using data obtained from Brazilian National Health System Information Technology Department (Datasus) for 2006-2009 (pre-vaccination period) and 2010-2014 (post-vaccination period); time trends were evaluated using the Poisson regression coefficient.in the comparison between pre- and post-vaccination periods, the percentage difference in the hospitalization rate for children under 1 year old ranged from -44.1% in the Western region to -1.4% in the Serrano Plateau region, and in children between 1-4 years old it ranged from -37.1% in the Northern Plateau region to 16.9% in the Serrano Plateau region (p<0.05); hospitalization rates in the state reduced by 23.3% in children under 1 year old and by 8.4% in those aged 1-4 years.a significant reduction in the rate of pneumonia hospitalization in children under 1 year old age was found, suggesting the effectiveness of the vaccine in reducing hospitalizations.",
