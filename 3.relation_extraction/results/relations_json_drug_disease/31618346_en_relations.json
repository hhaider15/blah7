    "text": "To evaluate the effects of ventilator hyperinflation on respiratory mechanics.A randomized crossover clinical trial was conducted with 38 mechanically ventilated patients with pulmonary infection. The order of the hyperinflation and control (without changes in the parameters) conditions was randomized. Hyperinflation was performed for 5 minutes in pressure-controlled ventilation mode, with progressive increases of 5cmH2O until a maximum pressure of 35cmH2O was reached, maintaining positive end expiratory pressure. After 35cmH2O was reached, the inspiratory time and respiratory rate were adjusted so that the inspiratory and expiratory flows reached baseline levels. Measurements of static compliance, total resistance and airway resistance, and peak expiratory flow were evaluated before the technique, immediately after the technique and after aspiration. Two-way analysis of variance for repeated measures was used with Tukey's post hoc test, and p < 0.05 was considered significant.Ventilator hyperinflation increased static compliance, which remained at the same level after aspiration (46.2 \u00b1 14.8 versus 52.0 \u00b1 14.9 versus 52.3 \u00b1 16.0mL/cmH2O; p < 0.001). There was a transient increase in airway resistance (6.6 \u00b1 3.6 versus 8.0 \u00b1 5.5 versus 6.6 \u00b1 3.5cmH2O/Ls-1; p < 0.001) and a transient reduction in peak expiratory flow (32.0 \u00b1 16.0 versus 29.8 \u00b1 14.8 versus 32.1 \u00b1 15.3Lpm; p <0.05) immediately after the technique; these values returned to pretechnique levels after tracheal aspiration. There were no changes in the control condition, nor were hemodynamic alterations observed.Ventilator hyperinflation promoted increased compliance associated with a transient increase in airway resistance and peak expiratory flow, with reduction after aspiration.",
