    "text": "This study analyzed the factors associated with tuberculosis in diabetics seen at health units of Vit\u00f3ria, ES, Brazil. This is a case-control study of 45 cases of diabetics seen in the 30 units of the municipality and reported in the SINAN with a diagnosis of tuberculosis in the 2007-2013 period and 90 cases of diabetic controls. We used data from the SINAN, the Health Information System of Vit\u00f3ria, and the Central Municipal Laboratory, as well a structured interview. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed, using logistic regression with the significant variables (p < 0.05). The case group presented a higher frequency of health-damaging life habits as compared to the control group, such as compulsive drinking (p < 0.001) and tobacco smoking (p = 0.060), as well as worse biochemical parameters, such as fasting blood sugar (p < 0.001) and glycosylated hemoglobin (p = 0.034). Regular drinking (OR 6.612, CI 2,151-20.330), previous contact with people with tuberculosis (OR 4.418, CI 1.678-11.631), and fasting blood sugar (OR 1.017, CI 1.007-1.026) were associated with tuberculosis in diabetics. The study reveals that poorer lifestyle habits and glycemic control and previous contact with active tuberculosis increase the chance of diabetics developing tuberculosis.",
