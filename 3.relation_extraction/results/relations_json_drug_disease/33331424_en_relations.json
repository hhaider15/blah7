    "text": "To analyze whether the older adults with difficulty or need of help to perform basic or instrumentals activities of daily living are more socially distanced in times of COVID-19. A total of 4,035 older adults participated in the telephone interviews from the second wave of the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSI-Brazil). Difficulty, need and receiving help were classified into: (1) independents; (2) had difficulty without need for care; (3) had difficulty, needed and have received care from someone within their household; (4) had difficulty, needed and have received care from someone outside their household; and (5) had difficulty and needed care but did not receive it. Social distancing was categorized as follows: did not leave their houses in the last 7 days, left their houses for essential activities and went out for non-essential activities. Multinomial regression model adjusted for age, sex, schooling and great geographical region was performed. Older adults who had difficulty, needed and have received help from within their homes (odds ratio - OR = 2.34 95%CI: 1.25-4.39) or from outside their homes (OR = 3.94; 95%CI: 2.24-6.92) were more socially distanced. Age increased the odds of not going out (OR = 1.06; 95%CI: 1.03-1.09) while be men reduced it (OR = 0.48; 95%CI: 0.33-0.70). Living in the South of Brazil has increased the odds of the respondents going out for essential activities (OR = 1.77; 95%CI: 1.01-3.10). Older adults who had difficulty, needed and have received help from within or outside their homes did not leave their homes in the last 7 days. Even with social distancing, these older adults can not have their exposure to COVID-19 reduced, weakening the theory of selective social distancing.",
