    "text": "A significant proportion of the infants developed recurrent wheezing after an acute bronchiolitis (AB) event. Recent studies have demonstrated protection for recurrent wheeze and lower respiratory morbidity in infants treated with azithromycin during an acute respiratory wheezing. The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that administration of azithromycin during an AB event reduces subsequent wheezing and hospital re-admissions.This is a secondary analysis of a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial, including unpublished data of wheezing and hospitalizations during the initial 6 months following admission for acute viral bronchiolitis. The study was performed in a tertiary University hospital. Infants (<12 months of age) hospitalized with AB were randomized to receive either azithromycin or placebo, administered orally, for 7 days. Families were contacted by telephone at 3 and 6 months after the initial acute event and answered to a standardized questionnaire in order to identify recurrent wheezing and hospital readmissions.One hundred and four patients were included (Azithromycin group, n= 50; placebo group, n=54). Considering the total of patients contacted 3 months after hospitalization (n=70), the recurrence rate of wheezing in the azithromycin group was significantly lower than in the placebo group (RR = 0.48; CI = 0.24-0.98; p = 0.038).Azithromycin significantly reduces the risk of subsequent wheezing between 0 and 3 months after hospital admission due to acute bronchiolitis irrespective of the presence of respiratory syncytial virus.",
