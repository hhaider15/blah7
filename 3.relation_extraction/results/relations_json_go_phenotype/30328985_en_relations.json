    "text": "This study aimed to study the incidence of stress hyperglycemia in critically ill children and to investigate the etiological basis of the hyperglycemia based on homeostasis model assessment.This was a prospective cohort study in one of the pediatric intensive care units of Cairo University, including 60 critically ill children and 21 healthy controls. Serum blood glucose, insulin, and C-peptide levels were measured within 24 hours of admission. Homeostasis model assessment was used to assess \u03b2-cell function and insulin sensitivity.Hyperglycemia was estimated in 70% of patients. Blood glucose values \u2265 180mg/dL were associated with a poor outcome. Blood glucose levels were positively correlated with Pediatric Risk for Mortality (PRISM III) score and number of organ dysfunctions (p = 0.019 and p = 0.022, respectively), while insulin levels were negatively correlated with number of organ dysfunctions (r = -0.33, p = 0.01). Homeostasis model assessment revealed that 26 (43.3%) of the critically ill patients had low \u03b2-cell function, and 18 (30%) had low insulin sensitivity. Combined pathology was detected in 2 (3.3%) patients only. Low \u03b2-cell function was significantly associated with the presence of multi-organ dysfunction; respiratory, cardiovascular, and hematological dysfunctions; and the presence of sepsis.\u03b2-Cell dysfunction appeared to be prevalent in our cohort and was associated with multi-organ dysfunction.",
