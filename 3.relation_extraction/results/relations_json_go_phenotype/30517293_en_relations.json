Arterial hypertension and diabetes were the comorbidities. Statistically significant correlations were obtained between arbovirus and schooling, employment situation, marital status, test results, and use of analgesics; and between the site of arthralgia and Chikungunya.The results support nursing care to hospitalized elderly patients with arbovirus, allowing the development of a proper and humanized care plan.",
