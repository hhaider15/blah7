    "text": "COVID-19 causes severe pulmonary involvement, but the cardiovascular system can also be affected by myocarditis, heart failure and shock. The increase in cardiac biomarkers has been associated with a worse prognosis.To evaluate the prognostic value of Troponin-T (TNT) and natriuretic peptide (BNP) in patients hospitalized for Covid-19.This was a convenience sample of patients hospitalized for COVID-19. Data were collected from medical records to assess the association of TnT and BNP measured in the first 24 hours of hospital admission with the combined outcome (CO) of death or need for mechanical ventilation. Univariate analysis was used to compare the groups with and without the CO. Cox's multivariate model was used to determine independent predictors of the CO.We evaluated 183 patients (age = 66.8\u00b117 years, 65.6% of which were males). The time of follow-up was 7 days (range 1 to 39 days). The CO occurred in 24% of the patients. The median troponin-T and BNP levels were 0.011 and 0.041ng/dL (p <0.001); 64 and 198 pg/dL (p <0.001), respectively, for the groups without and with the CO. In the univariate analysis, in addition to TnT and BNP, age, presence of coronary disease, oxygen saturation, lymphocytes, D-dimer, t-CRP and creatinine, were different between groups with and without outcomes. In the bootstrap multivariate analysis, only TnT (1.12 [95% CI 1.03-1.47]) and t-CRP (1.04 [95% CI 1.00-1.10]) were independent predictors of the CO.In the first 24h of admission, TnT, but not BNP, was an independent marker of mortality or need for invasive mechanical ventilation. This finding further reinforces the clinical importance of cardiac involvement in COVID-19. (Arq Bras Cardiol. 2020; 115(4):660-666).",
