Among the 43 children evaluated by TOAE, 30 \"passed\" in both ears, nine \"refered\" in both ears and four \"refered\" just in ear; 13/43 \"refered\" and needed to repeat screening. 43 children evaluated by CPR, 37 showed responses.most of the children evaluated had completed cochlear function and middle ear results refer in compatible with their age range.",
