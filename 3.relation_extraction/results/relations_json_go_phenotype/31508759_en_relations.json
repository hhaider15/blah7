    "text": "This paper aims to evaluate the effectiveness of telephone use for the adherence of people with HIV/AIDS to antiretroviral therapy. A systematic review was carried out in the following databases: Latin American and Caribbean Literature in Health Sciences (Lilacs/ Bireme), SCOPUS, Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE/PubMed), Web of Science; and in the Scientific Electronic Library Online (SciELO) and Cochrane libraries, using the following descriptors: \"HIV\", \"Cell Phones\", \"Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome\" and \"Antiretroviral Therapy, Highly Active\". We gathered a sample of 17 papers. The proposed cellphone interventions were the use of cellular applications, Short Message Service, and telephone calls. In most studies, telephone use has had a significant impact on adherence to treatment. The evaluation of the studies showed good methodological quality and adequate allocation secrecy. Self-reported adherence emerged among the adherence measuring methods. Cellphone use was effective in improving adherence to antiretroviral therapy for people living with HIV.",
