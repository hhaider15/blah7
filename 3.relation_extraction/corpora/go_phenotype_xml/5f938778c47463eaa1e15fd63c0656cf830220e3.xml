  <chunk id="5f938778c47463eaa1e15fd63c0656cf830220e3.c1" text="Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is one of the most economically important swine pathogens and causes reproductive failure in sows and respiratory disease in growing pigs. PRRSV mainly infects porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs), leading to the subversion of innate and adaptive immunity of pigs. The transcriptome analysis of gene expression profiles in PRRSV-infected PAMs is essential for understanding the pathogenesis of PRRSV. Here we performed next-generation RNA sequencing and a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis to characterize the dynamic transcriptome landscapes in PAMs following PRRSV infection. Totally 38222 annotated mRNAs, 12987 annotated long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), and 17624 novel lncRNAs in PRRSV-infected PAMs were identified through a transcripts computational identification pipeline. The differentially expressed mRNAs and lncRNAs during PRRSV infection were characterized. Several differentially expressed transcripts were validated using qRT-PCR. Analyses on dynamic overrepresented GO terms and KEGG pathways in PRRSV-infected PAMs at different time points were performed. Meanwhile the genes involved in IFN-related signaling pathways, proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, phagocytosis, and antigen presentation and processing were significantly downregulated, indicating the aberrant function of PAMs during PRRSV infection. Moreover, the differentially and highly expressed lncRNA XR 297549.1 was predicted to both cis-regulate and trans-regulate its neighboring gene, prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2), indicating its role in inflammatory response. Our findings reveal the transcriptome profiles and differentially expressed mRNAs and lncRNAs in PRRSV-infected PAMs in vitro, providing valuable information for further exploration of PRRSV pathogenesis.">
