However, only a selection of their products have been demonstrated to be responsible for the inhibition of rhabdovirus replication in cultured cells; and only a few have been shown to play a role in mediating the antiviral response in vivo using gene knockout mouse models. IFNs inhibit rhabdovirus replication at different stages via the induction of a variety of ISGs. This review will discuss how individual ISG products confer resistance to rhabdoviruses by blocking viral entry, degrading single stranded viral RNA, inhibiting viral translation or preventing release of virions from the cell. Furthermore, this review will highlight how these viruses counteract the host IFN system.">

They are associated with significant pathogenicity in humans and livestock [1] . The prototypes of this family are vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), a member of the Vesiculovirus genus, and rabies virus (RABV), a member of the Lyssavirus genus. VSV is an arthropod-borne virus that primarily affects rodents, cattle, swine and horses. It can induce mild symptoms upon infection of humans and other species and may also cause severe foot-and mouth-like disease in cattle and pigs. The closely related Chandipura virus has recently been associated with outbreaks of fatal acute encephalitis in several parts of India (for a review see [2] ). RABV is a prototype neurotropic virus that causes fatal disease in humans and animals. Human rabies is a zoonosis, which still accounts for 50,000 deaths per year worldwide despite the availability of effective vaccines.">

VSV inhibits host gene expression and translation [3] [4] [5] , interferes with the host cell's innate immune response and induces apoptosis of infected cells [6] .

The genome consists of a negative sense, single stranded RNA molecule of approximately 11 to 16 kb that encodes the five viral proteins common to all mononegavirales in the order of 3 1 -N-P-M-G-L-5 1 . The genome of many rhabdoviruses encodes accessory proteins, whose functions are not yet fully understood. These may occur as alternative or overlapping open reading frames (ORFs) within the major protein genes or as independent ORFs between the genes [10]. The viral RNA is associated with the nucleoprotein (N) to form a helical nucleocapsid (N-RNA). The nucleocapsid contains a significant amount of phosphoprotein (P), some of which is bound to the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), the large (L) protein. The N-RNA, together with the viral polymerase complex (P and L proteins) form the ribonucleoprotein (RNP). The RNP is enwrapped in a lipid bilayer, which is acquired from host cell membrane during the budding process. The matrix protein (M) and the glycoprotein (G) are membrane-associated proteins, whereby M is located beneath the viral membrane and maintains the compact structure of the virion by associating with both the nucleocapsid and the lipid bilayer, while the G protein is an integral transmembrane protein involved in viral entry.">

After binding to its receptor(s), the virus enters the cell via the endocytic pathway. The acidic environment within early endosomes induces Viruses 2015, 7 3677 a change in the conformation of the G protein that results in the fusion of the viral envelope with the endosomal membrane. After the fusion event, uncoating of the viral genome results in the release of the viral genomic RNA into the cytoplasm. The RNP constitutes the template for transcription of viral genes and the viral RNA polymerase (the L-P complex) is responsible for replication of the viral genome. RABV transcription and replication take place within Negri bodies, which are characteristic cytoplasmic inclusion bodies formed during viral infection [11] . Similar cytoplasmic inclusions have recently been reported in cells infected with VSV; these inclusions also contain the viral replication machinery [12] . During transcription, a positive-stranded leader RNA, uncapped and non-polyadenylated, and five capped and polyadenylated mRNAs encoding the five viral proteins are synthesized. At a later stage of infection, the polymerase switches to replication of the viral genome, which yields nucleocapsids containing the full-length antigenome (sense) RNA, which in turn serves as template for the synthesis of the (antisense) RNA genome. During their synthesis, both the nascent antigenome and the genome are encapsidated by the N protein. Specific transfer of the N protein to viral RNAs rather than to the cellular mRNAs is mediated by the P protein, which acts as a chaperone by binding the N alone (N˝) and maintaining its solubility [13] . The neo-synthesized genomic RNPs then serve either as templates for additional rounds of transcription and/or replication, or are transported to the cell membrane where they are assembled with the M and G proteins into virions, which are then released from the cell through the budding process.">
