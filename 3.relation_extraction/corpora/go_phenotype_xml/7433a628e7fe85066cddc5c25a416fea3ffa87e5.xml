Therefore, we tested in this study the concept of using S1P as a target to block efficient virus replication.">

Introduction of the S1P recognition motifs RRIL and RRLL into the reactive center loop of a 1 -antitrypsin resulted in abrogation of GP-C processing by endogenous S1P to a similar level observed in S1P-deficient cells. Moreover, S1P-specific a 1 -antitrypsins significantly inhibited replication and spread of a replication-competent recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus expressing the Lassa virus glycoprotein GP as well as authentic Lassa virus. Inhibition of viral replication correlated with the ability of the different a 1 -antitrypsin variants to inhibit the processing of the Lassa virus glycoprotein precursor.">
