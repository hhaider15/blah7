However, most infections are believed to be caused by respiratory viruses. A diagnostic study was performed to compare conventional viral tests with the recently developed real-time PCR technique.">

Conventional methods were used to check for respiratory syncytial virus, influenzavirus, parainfluenzavirus 1-3, rhinoviruses and adenoviruses. Real-time PCR was used to test for respiratory syncytial virus, influenzavirus, parainfluenzavirus 1-4, rhinoviruses, adenoviruses, human coronaviruses OC43, NL63 and 229E, human metapneumovirus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae."/>

Real-time PCR confirmed all of these positive results. In addition, real-time PCR identified 22 more viruses in 11 patients, yielding a total of 22 (96%) patients with a positive sample. More than one virus was detected in eight (35%) children."/>
