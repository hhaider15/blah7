  <chunk id="906246292449c131afd43009c5863e51ab99efc1.c1" text="When we contract an infection, we typically feel sick and behave accordingly. Symptoms of sickness behavior (SB) include anorexia, hypersomnia, depression, and reduced social interactions. SB affects species spanning from arthropods to vertebrates, is triggered nonspecifically by viruses, bacteria, and parasites, and is orchestrated by a complex network of cytokines and neuroendocrine pathways; clearly, it has been naturally selected. Nonetheless, SB seems evolutionarily costly: it promotes starvation and predation and reduces reproductive opportunities. How could SB persist? Former explanations focused on individual fitness, invoking improved resistance to pathogens. Could prevention of disease transmission, propagating in populations through kin selection, also contribute to SB?">

Its classical physiological signs include fever and anemia, but it also includes psychological symptoms-collectively termed &quot;sickness behavior&quot; (SB) [1-3]. These symptoms, familiar to anyone who has been sick, include fatigue, depression, irritability, discomfort, pain, nausea, and loss of interest in food, drink, social interactions, and sex. In animals, such changes can be quantified based on behavior and reflect reprioritization of motivations during disease [2] .">
