Our previous microarray analysis showed that H9N2 virus infection and inactivated viral particle inoculation increased the expression of interferon-inducible transmembrane protein 1 (IFITM1) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). In present study, we deeply investigated the expression patterns of IFITM1 and IFITM1-mediated antiviral response induced by H9N2 virus infection and inactivated viral particle inoculation in HUVECs. Epithelial cells that are considered target cells of the influenza virus were selected as a reference control. Methods: First, we quantified the expression levels of IFITM1 in HUVECs induced by H9N2 virus infection or viral particle inoculation using quantitative real-time PCR and western blot. Second, we observed whether hemagglutinin or neuraminidase affected IFITM1 expression in HUVECs. Finally, we investigated the effect of induced-IFITM1 on the antiviral state in HUVECs by siRNA and activation plasmid transfection.">

HA or NA protein binding alone is not sufficient to increase the levels of IFITM1 and interferon-ɑ/β in HUVECs. IFITM1 induced by viral particle inoculation significantly decreased the virus titers in culture supernatants of HUVECs. Conclusions: Our results showed that inactivated viral particle inoculation increased the expression of IFITM1 at mRNA and protein levels. Moreover, the induction of IFITM1 expression mediated the antiviral state in HUVECs.">
