  <chunk id="601a2a29ef252c46e3a3b19f35d1d6fb591b0af6.c1" text="The review reports a short biography of the Italian naturalized chemist Hugo Schiff and an outline on the synthesis and use of his most popular discovery: the imines, very well known and popular as Schiff Bases. Recent developments on their &quot;metallo-imines&quot; variants have been described. The applications of Schiff bases in organic synthesis as partner in Staudinger and hetero Diels-Alder reactions, as &quot;privileged&quot; ligands in the organometallic complexes and as biological active Schiff intermediates/targets have been reported as well.">
