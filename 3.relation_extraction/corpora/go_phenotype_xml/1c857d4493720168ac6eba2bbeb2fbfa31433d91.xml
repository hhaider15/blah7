It is not clear whether FccR receptors play a role in human asthma and allergy. The aim of current study was to investigate whether functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of FccR genes (FCGR) are associated with human asthma and allergy.">

The genotype and phenotype data (asthma, bronchial hyper-responsiveness, and atopy) of subjects were analyzed using family-based association tests (FBAT) and logistic regression adjusted for age and sex.">

  <chunk id="1c857d4493720168ac6eba2bbeb2fbfa31433d91.c3" text="Result: The FccRIIA-131His.Arg SNP is significantly associated with atopy in a family-based association test (P = 0.00287) and in a logistic regression analysis (P = 0.0269, OR 0.732, 95% CI: 0.555-0.965). The FccRIIA-131His (or rs1801274-A) allele capable of binding human IgG2 has a protective role against atopy. In addition, the rare FccRIIB-187Thr (or rs1050501-C) allele defective for the receptor-mediated inhibitory signals is a risk factor for atopy (P = 0.0031, OR 1.758, 95% CI: 1.209-2.556) and IgE production (P,0.001). However, variants of activating FccRIIIA (rs396991), and FccRIIIB (NA1 and NA2), and FccRIIC (rs10917661) are not associated with asthma, BHR, and atopy (P.0.05).">
