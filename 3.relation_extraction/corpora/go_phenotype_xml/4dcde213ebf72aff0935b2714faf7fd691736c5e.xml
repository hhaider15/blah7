  <chunk id="4dcde213ebf72aff0935b2714faf7fd691736c5e.c1" text="To probe the effect of 3 ,8&quot;-dimerization on antioxidant flavonoids, acacetin and its 3 ,8&quot;-dimer isoginkgetin were comparatively analyzed using three antioxidant assays, namely, the ·O 2 − scavenging assay, the Cu 2+ reducing assay, and the 2,2 -azino bis(3-ethylbenzothiazolin-6-sulfonic acid) radical scavenging assay. In these assays, acacetin had consistently higher IC 50 values than isoginkgetin. Subsequently, the acacetin was incubated with 4-methoxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxy radicals (4-methoxy-TEMPO) and then analyzed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC−ESI−Q−TOF−MS) technology. The results of the UHPLC−ESI−Q−TOF−MS analysis suggested the presence of a dimer with m/z 565, 550, 413, 389, 374, 345, 330, and 283 peaks. By comparison, standard isoginkgetin yielded peaks at m/z 565 , 533, 518, 489, 401, 389, 374, and 151 in the mass spectra. Based on these experimental data, MS interpretation, and the relevant literature, we concluded that isoginkgetin had higher electron transfer potential than its monomer because of the 3 ,8&quot;-dimerization. Additionally, acacetin can produce a dimer during its antioxidant process; however, the dimer is not isoginkgetin.">
