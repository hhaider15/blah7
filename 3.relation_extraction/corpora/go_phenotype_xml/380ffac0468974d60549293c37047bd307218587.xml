PDCoV-infected suckling piglets were characterized with thin and transparent intestinal walls from colon to caecum, spot hemorrhage at mesentery and intestinal bleeding. PDCoV RNA was detected in multiple organs and tissues by Taqman real-time RT-PCR, which had high copies in ileum, inguinal lymph node, rectum and spleen. PDCoV antigen was detected in the basal layer of jejunum and ileum by IHC. In this research, we found that PDCoV could infect various ages of farmed pigs with watery diarrhea and anorexia in different seasons in a year.">
