  <chunk id="0537823ee7ac420f3f6e1a1261afa425dd4cd1a6.c1" text="Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is a newly discovered coronavirus, which belongs to the family Coronaviridae. It causes watery diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration in newborn piglets. A sensitive RT-PCR method is urgently required to detect PDCoV infection. In this study, we developed and evaluated a conventional RT-PCR assay and a SYBR green-based real-time RT-PCR assay that targeted the PDCoV gene. Both assays are specific and have the same limit of detection at 2 Ã— 10 1 copies of RNA molecules per reaction. Eighty-four clinical samples were subjected to both conventional RT-PCR and real-time RT-PCR, and the same positive rate (41.7%) was achieved, which was much higher than the positive rate (26.2%) using a previously described onestep RT-PCR technique. In summary, a conventional RT-PCR technique was successfully established for the detection of PDCoV with the same detection limit as a SYBR green-based real-time RT-PCR assay.">
