  <chunk id="95c03885392135d1ba49d3db5480fd91750e5b73.c1" text="The first outbreak of influenza A(H3N2) occurred in 1968 and caused the third flu pandemic of the 20 th century. It has affected multiple countries over time. The best strategy to reduce the burden of influenza is through vaccination whose efficacy varies with respect to the circulating strains. This study was performed to better understand the molecular evolution of influenza A(H3N2) and assess vaccine efficacy in Cameroon. Complete sequences of three gene segments were obtained from 2014 to 2016 influenza seasons in Cameroon. Hemagglutinin (HA), Neuraminidase (NA) and matrix (M) genes of 35 A(H3N2) virus strains were amplified and sequenced. Predicted vaccine efficacy was measured using the P epitope model. Phylogenetic analysis of the HA gene showed that all Cameroonian strains had evolved away from the 3C.">
