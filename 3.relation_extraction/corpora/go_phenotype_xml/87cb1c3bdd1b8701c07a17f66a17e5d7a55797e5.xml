(A) PCLV in mosquitoes from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil clusters with other viral strains from Thailand on the phylogenetic tree with 74% bootstrap confidence at p-distance of 0.038. The dinucleotide profile reinforces the relationship between Rio and Asian strains of PCLV. (B) HTV also identified in mosquitoes"/>
