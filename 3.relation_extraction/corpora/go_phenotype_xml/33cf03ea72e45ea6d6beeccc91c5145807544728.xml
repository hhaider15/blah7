G-quadruplexes have been proved to be involved in the regulation of replication, DNA damage repair, and transcription and translation of oncogenes or other cancer-related genes. Therefore, targeting G-quadruplexes has become a novel promising anti-tumor strategy. Different kinds of small molecules targeting the G-quadruplexes have been designed, synthesized, and identified as potential anti-tumor agents, including molecules directly bind to the G-quadruplex and molecules interfering with the binding between the G-quadruplex structures and related binding proteins. This review will explore the feasibility of G-quadruplex ligands acting as anti-tumor drugs, from basis to application. Meanwhile, since helicase is the most well-defined G-quadruplex-related protein, the most extensive research on the relationship between helicase and G-quadruplexes, and its meaning in drug design, is emphasized.

However, compared to developing inhibitors for a specific enzyme or protein, selective interaction with the G-quadruplex structures in particular genome regions is difficult to achieve. An alternative strategy for discovering novel G-quadruplex-related compounds is to interfere with the binding between G-quadruplex-forming sequences and the binding proteins [15][16][17]. Considering the fact that the shifts between various secondary structures in nucleic acids actually are regulated by several proteins binding to the nucleic acids [18][19][20][21], this alternative strategy seems attractive. Therefore, we will further discuss the proteins that interact with G-quadruplexes, including both stabilizing and dissociating proteins, based on emerging findings regarding this kind of binding proteins.">

Helicases play essential roles in nucleic acid metabolism by facilitating cellular processes including replication, recombination, DNA repair, and transcription [23][24][25]. Furthermore, several members of the helicase family have the ability to regulate the degradation of G-quadruplexes, and subsequently regulate related biological processes to achieve anti-cancer effects [26][27][28][29][30][31][32]. Small molecules with influence on the function of G-quadruplexes via helicase have been discovered, developed, and well-evaluated [33,34]. Therefore, we hope to focus on the progress made in helicase-related leading compounds to give a comprehensive view of this field.">

Twenty years later, studies showed that the G-quadruplex structure can form in G-rich repeats at the ends of telomeres [36]. By immunostaining the telomeric G-quadruplexes using a specific antibody, G-quadruplex structures were proven in 2001 to be formed in cells [37]. From then on, several G-quadruplex-specific single-chain antibodies (scFv antibody) have been developed using different display processes, and these scFv antibodies have been used in DNA or RNA G-quadruplex mapping in cells [38][39][40]. Combined with next-generation sequencing, genome mapping and thorough functional elucidation have been reported [3] . All these results support the existence of G-quadruplex structures in the genome.">

The core structures in the G-quadruplex are two or three G-quartets, which form from four guanines via Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds. In addition, the G-quadruplex is stabilized by univalent metal cations (Na + or K + ) located in the central channel of the plane (Figure 1 ). G-quadruplex structures may form intramolecular G-quadruplexes within a single DNA strand, or intermolecular G-quadruplexes between multiple DNA strands [41]. Moreover, due to the various orientations of nucleic acids strands during folding, the G-quadruplex structures can further divide into different conformations, including parallel, antiparallel, and hybrid conformations ( Figure 2) . Generally, the configuration and stability of the G-quadruplex structures are related to the length and the composition of the G-quadruplex-forming sequence, the length of the annulus structure between Gs, the number of DNA strands, and the type of binding cations [42][43][44][45].">
