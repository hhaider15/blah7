Using the Metacore TM database, 29 DEPs were enriched in a network involved in p53 regulation. Besides, a significantly enriched pathway suggests that the CPV-induced cytopathic effect was probably due to the deficiency of functional CFTR caused by CPV infection. This study uncovered the systemic changes in key cellular factors involved in CPV infection and help to understand the molecular mechanisms of the anti-cancer activity of CPV and the cytopathic effects induced by CPV infection."/>
  <chunk id="a51659a324f74a7cf16acd3b1180d203cab2b8d4.c2" text="Canine parvovirus (CPV) is a member of autonomous parvoviruses in the Parvoviridae family. It appears as an icosahedral capsid that encloses a single-strand DNA genome that is 5.2 kb long. CPV replicates without the use of a helper virus and hence is called autonomous, but it utilises the machinery and components of host cells, including DNA polymerase and RNA polymerase Ι Ι for DNA replication and RNA transcription, respectively. Consequently, CPV replication is restricted to the S phase of the cell cycle 1,2 .">

  <chunk id="a51659a324f74a7cf16acd3b1180d203cab2b8d4.c3" text="The CPV genome contains two open reading frames; by alternative splicing, one produces two mRNAs encoding two non-structural proteins (NS1 and NS2), and the other transcribes two mRNAs encoding two structural proteins (VP1 and VP2) 3 . The VP1 and VP2 proteins contain the most important antigenic epitopes, which are targeted by neutralising antibodies. VP2, which represents 90% of the viral capsid, also functions as a viral ligand that determines the viral host specificity and tissue affinity 4 . NS1, a pleiotropic phosphoprotein, is thought to be a culprit of apoptosis of CPV-infected cells. For instance, NS1 of CPV-2 has been shown to induce caspase-dependent and p53-independent apoptosis 5 ."/>

CPV infection causes high fatality in neonatal animals and severe haemorrhagic enteritis in adult dogs 7 . It is introduced by faecal-oral transmission, and it initially infects and replicates in the rapidly dividing cells of lymphoid tissues, intestinal crypt epithelial cells, and precursor cells in the bone marrow. Severe haemorrhagic enteritis increases the risk for viral translocation and coliform septicaemia, leading to septic shock and ultimately death 8 . CPV infects cells by binding to the transferrin receptor 9 , and CPV pathogenicity is thought to be caused by the non-structural proteins of parvoviruses 10 .">
