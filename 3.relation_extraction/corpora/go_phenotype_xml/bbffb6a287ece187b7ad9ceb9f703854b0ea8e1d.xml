Whereas a cell is fully equipped for this task, viruses often depend on the host to supply tools for their transcription program. Over the course of evolution and adaptation, viruses have found diverse ways to optimally exploit cellular host processes such as transcription to their own benefit. Just as cells are increasingly understood to employ nascent RNAs in transcription regulation, recent discoveries are revealing how viruses use nascent RNAs to benefit their own gene expression. In this review, we first outline the two different transcription programs used by viruses, i.e., transcription (DNA-dependent) and RNA-dependent RNA synthesis. Subsequently, we use the distinct stages (initiation, elongation, termination) to describe the latest insights into nascent RNA-mediated regulation in the context of each relevant stage."/>

Furthermore, because RNAs can be smaller (see point one) it is easier to avoid recognition by the host's immune system. Third, RNA can store information in its sequence, its secondary and tertiary structure, its ability to form ligand-binding platforms (e.g., riboswitches or ribozymes), and via chemical modification of bases and sugars. This makes RNA a flexible molecule, adaptive to multiple situations. Fourth, RNAs, like proteins, are modular and can use domains or different surfaces within one domain to interact with other molecules [11] . The modular nature of RNAs and the versatility of each module (see point three) dramatically expands the repertoire of regulatory RNAs.">

In this review, we will describe several recent discoveries of intriguing viral pathways that manipulate gene expression of the host for their own benefit via nascent RNA. To place these discoveries in context, we will first describe the current understanding of the distinct stages (initiation, elongation, termination) in the general mechanism of eukaryotic transcription, as used by the host and virus, and present examples of nascent RNA-mediated regulation in the context of each relevant stage.">

  <chunk id="bbffb6a287ece187b7ad9ceb9f703854b0ea8e1d.c4" text="Cellular RNA is synthesized from a DNA template in a process called transcription by RNAP-containing transcription complexes. Eukaryotes employ three different classes of RNAP: RNAPI, II, III, while plants also encode for RNAPIV and V [12] . Of these, primarily RNAPII is used to synthesize cellular mRNA and viral mRNAs. RNAPII is a 550 kDa multi-subunit enzyme complex. These subunits are arranged in a claw-like manner (Figure 1) , with a central cleft through which the template DNA is threaded. Nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs) enter the polymerase via the funnel and the newly transcribed RNA exits RNAPII through an RNA-exit channel formed by the mobile clamp and wall elements. Unique to RNAPII is an unstructured carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) that extends from the largest subunit and is composed of 52 heptapeptide repeats (consensus: Tyr 1 -Ser 2 -Pro 3 -Thr 4 -Ser 5 -Pro 6 -Ser 7 ) [13] . The serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues can be reversibly phosphorylated [14] . Changes in the phosphorylation patterns of the CTD during transcription orchestrate the association of different sets of transcription-regulating factors with RNAP.">

  <chunk id="bbffb6a287ece187b7ad9ceb9f703854b0ea8e1d.c5" text="In the early 1960s, researchers observed that a subset of viruses were resistant to actinomycin D, a drug that inhibits cellular DNA-directed RNA synthesis as performed by RNAPII [15]. This led to the discovery of RNA viruses. Like their DNA-containing counterparts, these RNA viruses are grouped into double stranded (ds) and single stranded (ss) virus classes. The ssRNA viruses are further subdivided into negative or positive sense single-stranded (âˆ’ss or +ss, respectively), depending on viral genomic RNA (vRNA) polarity. All RNA viruses encode an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) to copy the vRNA and synthesize the viral mRNA. RdRp synthesizes RNA complementary to the starting RNA template and is an essential protein of all RNA viruses that have no intermediate 17] . This process is often called &quot;transcription&quot;, but differs from the conventional definition of transcription by using RNA rather than DNA as a template for mRNA synthesis. To avoid confusion, we will refer to RNA-dependent mRNA (Rd-mRNA) synthesis in this review. Both transcription and Rd-mRNA synthesis occur in three stages: initiation, elongation and termination (Figure 1 ). During initiation, the polymerase machinery is recruited to the viral promoter. Initiation of Rd-mRNA synthesis begins at or near the 3 end of the RNA template in a primer-independent (de novo), or a primer-dependent mechanism. Subsequently, 5 to 3 elongation starts but is frequently interrupted by pauses [18] . Finally, the mRNA is terminated and released from the elongation complex. During the elongation phase, a complementary mRNA product is generated by 5 to 3 processive nucleotidyl transfer [19, 20] . The three stages of mRNA synthesis by both RNAP and RdRp, and their associated regulatory events, are described in detail below.">
