The aim of this study was to define the antiviral activity of Vδ2 T-cells against ZIKV-infected cells. The Vδ2 T-cells expansion and their cytotoxic activity against ZIKV-infected cells were tested in vitro and analyzed by RT-PCR and flow cytometry. We found that ZIKV infection was able to induce Vδ2 T-cells expansion and sensitized A549 cells to Vδ2-mediated killing. Indeed, expanded Vδ2 T-cells killed ZIKV-infected cells through degranulation and perforin release. Moreover, ZIKV infection was able to increase the expression on A549 cells of NKG2D ligands (NKG2DLs), namely MICA, MICB, and ULBP2, at both the mRNA and protein levels, suggesting the possible involvement of these molecules in the recognition by NKG2D-expressing Vδ2 T-cells. Indeed, the killing of ZIKV-infected cells by expanded Vδ2 T-cells was mediated by NKG2D/NKG2DL interaction as NKG2D neutralization abrogated Vδ2 cytotoxicity. Our data showed a strong antiviral activity of Vδ2 T-cells against ZIKV-infected cells, suggesting their involvement in the protective immune response. Other studies are necessary to investigate whether the lack of Vδ2 T-cells expansion in vivo may be associated with disease complications.">

Given the range of clinical symptoms, there is a pressing need to elucidate the protective immunological profile and to identify the immune signature associated with complication. Effective control of ZIKV involves both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. Neutralizing antibodies are produced after ZIKV infection, control viral replication [10], and correlate with protection against secondary infection [11] [12] [13] ."/>

In mice, polyfunctional cytotoxic CD8+ T-cells are activated [14] and reduce ZIKV burden, whereas their depletion resulted in greater ZIKV infection and mortality [15] . Adoptive transfer of ZIKV-specific CD8+ T-cells can protect against ZIKV infection [16] , confirming the role of CD8+ T-cells against ZIKV. Nevertheless, CD8+ T-cells could also have pathological consequences in the brain [17] resulting in ZIKV-associated paralysis [18] . The role of CD4+ T-cells in the protection/pathogenesis of ZIKV infection is not fully elucidated. CD4+ T-cells proliferated and produced Th1 cytokines in mice [19] , and their depletion reduced humoral response [20] . In ZIKV-infected humans, CD4+ T-cells differentiated into effectors cells but showed an impaired IFN-γ production [21] .">

During acute ZIKV infection in humans, an expansion of Vδ2 T-cells was observed. These expanded Vδ2 T-cells showed an effector profile, were enriched of Granzyme B and were able to produce IFN-γ when stimulated with a specific antigen [21] .
