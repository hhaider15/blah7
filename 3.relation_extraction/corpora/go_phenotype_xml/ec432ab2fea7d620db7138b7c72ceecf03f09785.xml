  <chunk id="ec432ab2fea7d620db7138b7c72ceecf03f09785.c1" text="There are no approved therapies for Ebola virus infection. Here, to find potential therapeutic targets, we perform a screen for genes essential for Ebola virus (EBOV) infection. We identify GNPTAB, which encodes the α and β subunits of N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate transferase. We show that EBOV infection of a GNPTAB knockout cell line is impaired, and that this is reversed by reconstituting GNPTAB expression. Fibroblasts from patients with mucolipidosis II, a disorder associated with mutations in GNPTAB, are refractory to EBOV, whereas cells from their healthy parents support infection. Impaired infection correlates with loss of the expression of cathepsin B, known to be essential for EBOV entry. GNPTAB activity is dependent upon proteolytic cleavage by the SKI-1/S1P protease. Inhibiting this protease with the small-molecule PF-429242 blocks EBOV entry and infection. Disruption of GNPTAB function may represent a strategy for a host-targeted therapy for EBOV.">
