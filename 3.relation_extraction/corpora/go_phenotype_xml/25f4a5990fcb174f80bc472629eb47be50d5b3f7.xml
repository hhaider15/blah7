Though viral respiratory tract infections are reported triggers for exacerbations, information on these infections with asthma is sparse in Caribbean territories. We examined the distribution of respiratory viruses and their association with seasons in acute and stable asthmatic children in Trinidad.">

Acute asthmatics were thrice as likely to be infected with a respiratory virus (OR = 2.5, 95% CI = 1.2 -5.3). The predominant pathogens detected in acute versus stable asthmatics were the rhinovirus (RV) (n = 18, 25.7% vs. n = 7, 8.8%; p = 0.005), respiratory syncytial virus B (RSV B) (n = 2, 2.9% vs. n = 4, 5.0%), and enterovirus (n = 1, 1.4% vs. n = 2, 2.5%). Strong odds for rhinoviral infection were observed among nebulised children compared with stable asthmatics (p = 0.005, OR = 3.6, 95% CI = 1.4 -9.3,). RV was prevalent throughout the year (Dry, n = 6, 15.8%; Rainy, n = 19, 17.0%) and without seasonal association [c 2 = 0.028, p = 0.867]. However it was the most frequently detected virus [Dry = 6/10, (60.0%); Rainy = 19/28, (67.9%)] in both seasons.">
