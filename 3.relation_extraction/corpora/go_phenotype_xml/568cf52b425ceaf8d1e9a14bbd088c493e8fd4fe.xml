  <chunk id="568cf52b425ceaf8d1e9a14bbd088c493e8fd4fe.c1" text="Background: Poliovirus, the causative agent of poliomyelitis, is a human enterovirus and a member of the family of Picornaviridae and among the most rapidly evolving viruses known. Analysis of codon usage can reveal much about the molecular evolution of the viruses. However, little information about synonymous codon usage pattern of polioviruses genome has been acquired to date."/>
