However, as of today, no dedicated software exists that implements these methods and allow comparisons.">

Most methods used the epidemic curve and the generation time distribution. Two categories of methods were available: those estimating the initial reproduction number, and those estimating a time dependent reproduction number. We implemented five methods as an R library, developed sensitivity analysis tools for each method and provided numerical illustrations of their use. A comparison of the performance of the different methods on simulated datasets is reported. Conclusions: This software package allows a standardized and extensible approach to the estimation of the reproduction number and generation interval distribution from epidemic curves.">
