  <chunk id="a0916fa29144e650632aba916141809195ab6809.c1" text="Background: Communicable disease outbreaks of novel or existing pathogens threaten human health around the globe. It would be desirable to rapidly characterize such outbreaks and develop accurate projections of their duration and cumulative size even when limited preliminary data are available. Here we develop a mathematical model to aid public health authorities in tracking the expansion and contraction of outbreaks with explicit representation of factors (other than population immunity) that may slow epidemic growth."/>

  <chunk id="a0916fa29144e650632aba916141809195ab6809.c3" text="Principal Findings: Compared to simulated data, IDEA provides highly accurate estimates of total size and duration for a given outbreak when R 0 is low or moderate, and also identifies turning points or new waves. When tested with an outbreak of pandemic influenza A (H1N1), the model generates estimated incidence at the i+1 th serial interval using data from the i th serial interval within an average of 20% of actual incidence."/>

Further evaluation in the context of real-world outbreaks will establish the utility of IDEA as a tool for front-line epidemiologists.">
