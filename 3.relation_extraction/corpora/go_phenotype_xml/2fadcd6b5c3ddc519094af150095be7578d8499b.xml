  <chunk id="2fadcd6b5c3ddc519094af150095be7578d8499b.c1" text="Viroporins are a group of transmembrane proteins with low molecular weight that are encoded by many animal viruses. Generally, viroporins are composed of 50-120 amino acid residues and possess a minimum of one hydrophobic region that interacts with the lipid bilayer and leads to dispersion. Viroporins are involved in destroying the morphology of host cells and disturbing their biological functions to complete the life cycle of the virus. The 2B proteins encoded by enteroviruses, which belong to the family Picornaviridae, can form transmembrane pores by oligomerization, increase the permeability of plasma membranes, disturb the homeostasis of calcium in cells, induce apoptosis, and cause autophagy; these abilities are shared among viroporins. The present paper introduces the structure and biological characteristics of various 2B proteins encoded by enteroviruses of the family Picornaviridae and may provide a novel idea for developing antiviral drugs.">
