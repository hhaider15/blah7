This study aimed to determine which preventive measures may have been effective in protecting HCWs from infection, and which were not effective.">

The HCWs with IgG against SARS and those without IgG against SARS were respectively defined as the &quot;case group&quot; and the &quot;control group&quot;, and logistic regression was conducted to explore the risk factors for SARS infection in HCWs."/>
