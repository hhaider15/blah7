  <chunk id="9bacd5e08a587ec2c4a6f367044249fa7c0129bd.c1" text="West Nile virus (WNV) is a positive sense, single-stranded RNA virus that can cause illness in humans when transmitted via mosquito vectors. Unfortunately, no antivirals or vaccines are currently available, and therefore efficient and safe antivirals are urgently needed. We developed a high throughput screen to discover small molecule probes that inhibit virus infection of Vero E6 cells. A primary screen of a 13,001 compound library at a 10 µM final concentration was conducted using the 384-well format. Z′ values ranged from 0.54-0.83 with a median of 0.74. Average S/B was 17 and S/N for each plate ranged from 10.8 to 23.9. Twenty-six compounds showed a dose response in the HT screen and were further evaluated in a time of addition assay and in a titer reduction"/>

The hit rate from the primary screen was 0.185% (24 compounds out of 13,001 compounds) and from the secondary screens was 0.053% (7 out of 13,001 compounds) respectively."/>
