However, there is not a perfect correspondence between transmission history and virus phylogeny. Both node height and topological differences may occur, depending on the interaction between within-host evolutionary dynamics and between-host transmission patterns. To investigate these interactions, we added a within-host evolutionary model in epidemiological simulations and examined if the resulting phylogeny could recover different types of contact networks. To further improve realism, we also introduced patient-specific differences in infectivity across disease stages, and on the epidemic level we considered incomplete sampling and the age of the epidemic. Second, we implemented an inference method based on approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) to discriminate among three well-studied network models and jointly estimate both network parameters and key epidemiological quantities such as the infection rate. Our ABC framework used both topological and distance-based tree statistics for comparison between simulated and observed trees. Overall, our simulations showed that a virus time-scaled phylogeny (genealogy) may be substantially different from the between-host transmission tree. This has important implications for the interpretation of what a phylogeny reveals about the underlying epidemic contact network. In particular, we found that while the within-host evolutionary process obscures the transmission tree, the diversification process and infectivity dynamics also add discriminatory power to differentiate between different types of contact networks. We also found that the possibility to differentiate contact networks depends on how far an epidemic has progressed, where distance-based tree statistics have more power early in an epidemic. Finally, we applied our ABC inference on two different outbreaks from the Swedish HIV-1 epidemic."/>

However, collecting data to develop a good representation of the network is very challenging. The increasing availability of sequence data provide additional information: previous work has shown that it is possible to recover social network features from viral phylogenies. Until now, however, it was assumed that within-host evolution is negligible in the reconstruction. Here, we propose an approach based on approximate Bayesian computation to infer network structure from a virus phylogeny, explicitly including a model for within-host evolution. In addition, we incorporate other important heterogeneity factors such as individual-based transmission rates and infectivity varying by diseasestage. We show that in some situations the within-host virus diversity adds valuable signal to identify network structure, but in other situations it muddles the underlying contact structure.">
