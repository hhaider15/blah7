The data indicate that at least 17 species from ten avian orders occupying different habitats excrete vaccine-derived Newcastle disease viruses. The most frequently reported isolates were detected among individuals in the order Columbiformes (n = 23), followed in frequency by the order Anseriformes (n = 13). Samples were isolated from both free-ranging (n = 47) and wild birds kept in captivity (n = 7). The number of recovered vaccine-derived viruses corresponded with the most widely utilized vaccines, LaSota (n = 28) and Hitchner B1 (n = 19). Other detected vaccine-derived viruses resembled the PHY-LMV2 and V4 vaccines, with five and two cases, respectively. These results and the ubiquitous and synanthropic nature of wild pigeons highlight their potential role as indicator species for the presence of Newcastle disease virus of low virulence in the environment. The reverse spillover of live agents from domestic animals to wildlife as a result of the expansion of livestock industries employing massive amounts of live virus vaccines represent an underappreciated and poorly studied effect of human activity on wildlife.">

Some factors responsible for the presence of etiological agents at this interface include ecological changes such as spatial and temporal landuse alterations, pathogen adaptations to new hosts, and the introduction of non-native, permissive species [5] [6] [7] [8] . Of all the factors influencing disease emergence, likely the most substantial is the loss of ecological species barriers, permitting opportunistic pathogens access to wildlife [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] ."/>

As an example, avian influenza is a biosecurity threat to the poultry industry due to its spillover from waterfowl reservoirs and subsequent viral spill back from domestic chickens (Gallus gallus) [16, 17] . What remains largely unstudied, however, is the spillover of live vaccines from domesticated species into wildlife. For the purpose of this paper we define &quot;spillover or spillover of live vaccines&quot; as the unintended transmission of live poultry vaccine viruses from domestic, gallinaceous poultry into non-target birds. Inadequate recognition of spillover events may be due to a lack of surveillance efforts, low mortality of infected animals, migration, or undetected resident wild bird morbidity [18] [19] [20] . The continuous expansion of the poultry industry, coupled with the mass employment of live virus vaccines, increases the probability of spillover of vaccines [21] [22] [23] ."/>

Poultry producers routinely employ multiple live vaccines against economically significant pathogens, such as Marek's disease virus, Infectious bursal disease virus, Infectious bronchitis virus, Infectious laryngotracheitis virus, and Newcastle disease virus (NDV) [24] [25] [26] [27] . Circulating live vaccine viruses present additional risks such as reversion of virulence and recombination with wild-type strains. In addition, the immune response of wild birds induced by infection with vaccine strains may provide selective pressures resulting in viral antigenic drift or increased virulence [23, [28] [29] [30] [31] .">

Their use is highly desirable as they are inexpensive, allow mass application, and stimulate both strong mucosal and cell-mediated immunity [32] [33] [34] . In the United States, the continuous demand for more effective vaccines is also likely driven by the industry's prior experience with large-scale poultry epidemics. For example, producers in California experienced Newcastle disease (ND) outbreaks in 1971 and again in 2002, each costing millions of dollars to eradicate and requiring the depopulation of millions of birds [35, 36] ."/>
