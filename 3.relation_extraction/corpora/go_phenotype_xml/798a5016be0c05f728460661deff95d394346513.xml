The inhibitory activity of seven phlorotannins (Ecklonia cava was tested against tyrosinase, which converts tyrosine into dihydroxyphenylalanine. Compounds 3 and 5 had IC 50 values of 7.0 ± 0.2 and 8.8 ± 0.1 µM, respectively, in competitive mode, with K i values of 8.2 ± 1.1 and 5.8 ± 0.8 µM. Both compounds showed the characteristics of slow-binding inhibitors over the time course of the enzyme reaction. Compound 3 had a single-step binding mechanism and compound 5 a two-step-binding mechanism. With stable AutoDock scores of −6.59 and −6.68 kcal/mol, respectively, compounds 3 and 5 both interacted with His85 and Asn260 at the active site.">
