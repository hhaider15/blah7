Drugs 2011, 9 1683 antiparasitic activities against Leishmania major and Trypanosoma brucei, and for protease inhibition against several cysteine proteases such as falcipain, rhodesain, cathepsin L, cathepsin B, and viral proteases SARS-CoV M pro , and PL pro . The compounds showed antiparasitic activities against T. brucei and time-dependent inhibition of cathepsin L-like proteases with K i values in the low micromolar range."/>
