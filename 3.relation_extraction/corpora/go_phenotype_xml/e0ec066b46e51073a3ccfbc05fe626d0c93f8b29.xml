The presence of antibodies against bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BHV-1), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), and bovine parainfluenza-3 virus (BPI-3V) in the samples was detected by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Epidemiological data were obtained using a questionnaire administered to the owner or manager of each herd.">

Regarding the seroprevalence by municipalities, there was a statistical association (p&lt;0.05) for BVDV; however, for BRSV, BHV-1, and BPI-3V, no statistical association was found (p&gt;0.05) between seropositive values and the municipalities, indicating that animal was seropositive in similar proportions in the three municipalities. Female sex and older animals (&gt;24 months) were a significant risk factor for BHV-1 and BPI-3V infection. Regarding the clinical signs, there was a statistical association (p&lt;0.05) between the seropositive values of BVDV and most of clinical signs observed, except for abortion."/>

Therefore, appropriate sanitary management practices and routine vaccination programs should be adopted to reduce the seroprevalence of these infectious agents."/>
