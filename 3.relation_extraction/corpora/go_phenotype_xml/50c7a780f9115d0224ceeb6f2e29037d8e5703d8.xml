  <chunk id="50c7a780f9115d0224ceeb6f2e29037d8e5703d8.c1" text="During infection, many RNA viruses produce characteristic inclusion bodies that contain both viral and host components. These structures were first described over a century ago and originally termed &quot;X-bodies,&quot; as their function was not immediately appreciated. Whilst some inclusion bodies may represent cytopathic by-products of viral protein overaccumulation, X-bodies have emerged as virus &quot;factories,&quot; quasi-organelles that coordinate diverse viral infection processes such as replication, protein expression, evasion of host defenses, virion assembly, and intercellular transport. Accordingly, they are now generally referred to as viral replication complexes (VRCs). We previously used confocal fluorescence microscopy to unravel the complex structure of X-bodies produced by Potato virus X (PVX).">
