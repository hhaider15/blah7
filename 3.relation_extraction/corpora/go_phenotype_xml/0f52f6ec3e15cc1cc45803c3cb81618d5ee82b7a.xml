  <chunk id="0f52f6ec3e15cc1cc45803c3cb81618d5ee82b7a.c1" text="Influenza is active during the winter and spring in the city of Beijing, which has a typical temperate climate with four clear distinct seasons. The clinical and laboratory surveillance data for influenza have been used to construct critical indicators for influenza activities in the community, and previous studies have reported varying degrees of association between laboratory-confirmed influenza specimens and outpatient consultation rates of influenza-like illness in subtropical cities. However, few studies have reported on this issue for cities in temperate regions, especially in developing countries. Furthermore, the mechanism behind age-specific seasonal epidemics remains unresolved, although it has been widely discussed. We utilized a wavelet analysis method to monitor the coherence of weekly percentage of laboratory-confirmed influenza specimens with the weekly outpatient consultation rates of influenza-like illness in Beijing, China. We first examined the seasonal pattern of laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza A (subtyped into seasonal A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) and pandemic virus A(H1N1) pdm09) and influenza B separately within the period from 2008-2015; then, we detected the coherence of clinical and laboratory surveillance data in this district, specially examining weekly time series of age-specific epidemics of influenza-like illnesses in the whole study period for three age categories (age 0-5, 5-15 and 25-60). We found that influenza A and B were both active in winter but were not always seasonally synchronous in Beijing. Synchronization between age ranges was found in most epidemic peaks from 2008-2015. Our findings suggested that peaks of influenza-like illness in individuals aged 0-5 and 5-15 years consistently appeared ahead of those of adults, implying the possibility that schoolchildren may lead epidemic fluctuations. 2 / 11 proportion of positive laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza A and B (LAB). (A) Normalized weekly percentage of ILI consultations and laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza (A and B); (B) Cross wavelet transform of the LAB and ILI time series. The power values were colored in Fig 2B. The black solid contour lines indicate the regions of power significant at the 95% confidence level which can be assumed to be a true feature. The region outside the black-curved cone indicates the presence of edge effects and is not drawn as the evidence for conclusions. (C) Phases of LAB and ILI time series (solid lines, colors as in Fig 2A) and their phase difference (black dashed lines)."/>
