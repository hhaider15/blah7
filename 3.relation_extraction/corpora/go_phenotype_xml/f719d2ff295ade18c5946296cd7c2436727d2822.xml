  <chunk id="f719d2ff295ade18c5946296cd7c2436727d2822.c1" text="Backgrounds: A new highly pathogenic human coronavirus (CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), has emerged in Jeddah and Saudi Arabia and quickly spread to some European countries since September 2012. Until 15 May 2014, it has infected at least 572 people with a fatality rate of about 30% globally. Studies to understand the virus and to develop antiviral drugs or therapy are necessary and urgent. In the present study, MERS-CoV papain-like protease (PL pro ) is expressed, and its structural and functional consequences are elucidated."/>
  <chunk id="f719d2ff295ade18c5946296cd7c2436727d2822.c2" text="Results: Circular dichroism and Tyr/Trp fluorescence analyses indicated that the secondary and tertiary structure of MERS-CoV PL pro is well organized and folded. Analytical ultracentrifugation analyses demonstrated that MERS-CoV PL pro is a monomer in solution. The steady-state kinetic and deubiquitination activity assays indicated that MERS-CoV PL pro exhibits potent deubiquitination activity but lower proteolytic activity, compared with SARS-CoV PL pro . A natural mutation, Leu105, is the major reason for this difference.">

These findings provide important insights into the structural and functional properties of coronaviral PL pro family, which is applicable to develop strategies inhibiting PL pro against highly pathogenic coronaviruses.">
