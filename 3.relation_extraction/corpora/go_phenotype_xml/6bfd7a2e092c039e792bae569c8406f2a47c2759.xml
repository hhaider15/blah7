Face-masks worn by the general population could be an accessible and affordable intervention, if effective when worn under routine circumstances."/>

Personal respirators were more efficient than surgical masks, which were more efficient than home-made masks. Regardless of mask type, children were less well protected. Outward protection (mask wearing by a mechanical head) was less effective than inward protection (mask wearing by healthy volunteers).">
