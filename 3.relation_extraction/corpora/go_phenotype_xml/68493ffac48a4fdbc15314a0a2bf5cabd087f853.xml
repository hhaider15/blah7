  <chunk id="68493ffac48a4fdbc15314a0a2bf5cabd087f853.c1" text="New World bats have recently been discovered to harbor influenza A virus (FLUAV)-related viruses, termed bat-associated influenza A-like viruses (batFLUAV). The internal proteins of batFLUAV are functional in mammalian cells. In contrast, no biological functionality could be demonstrated for the surface proteins, hemagglutinin (HA)-like (HAL) and neuraminidase (NA)-like (NAL), and these proteins need to be replaced by their human counterparts to allow spread of batFLUAV in human cells. Here, we employed rhabdoviral vectors to study the role of HAL and NAL in viral entry. Vectors pseudotyped with batFLUAV-HAL and -NAL were able to enter bat cells but not cells from other mammalian species. Host cell entry was mediated by HAL and was dependent on prior proteolytic activation of HAL and endosomal low pH. In contrast, sialic acids were dispensable for HAL-driven entry. Finally, the type II transmembrane serine protease TMPRSS2 was able to activate HAL for cell entry indicating that batFLUAV can utilize human proteases for HAL activation. Collectively, these results identify viral and cellular factors governing host cell entry driven by batFLUAV surface proteins. They suggest that the absence of a functional receptor precludes entry of batFLUAV into human cells while other prerequisites for entry, HAL activation and protonation, are met in target cells of human origin. and Molecular Biosciences, Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) grants GSC 226/1 and GSC 226/2 (www.dfg.de).

  <chunk id="68493ffac48a4fdbc15314a0a2bf5cabd087f853.c3" text="The viral surface proteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) facilitate FLUAV entry and release from target cells, respectively. HA facilitates viral attachment to cells by binding to sialic acids on cell surface proteins or lipids [9-11] and, upon proteolytic activation by a host cell protease and exposure to endosomal low pH, mediates fusion of the viral membrane with the endosomal membrane [12] [13] [14] . In contrast, NA promotes release of progeny particles from infected cells by removing sialic acids from cell surface factors. Based on sequence and antigenic properties, sixteen HA (H1-16) and nine NA (N1-9) subtypes have been identified, and viruses representing all HA and NA subtypes are circulating in waterfowl [4, 15] . However, FLUAV-related viruses were recently discovered in New World bats [16, 17] , provisionally termed bat-associated influenza A-like viruses (batFLUAV), and were shown to harbor HAand NA-like proteins (termed HAL and NAL), which constitute new subtypes, H17/H18 (HL17/HL18) and N10/N11 (NL10/NL11), respectively. The question whether these viruses have the potential to infect and spread in humans is the focus of current research efforts.">

In contrast, the HAL and NAL proteins of batFLUAV were incompatible with viral spread in the cell culture systems examined so far [18, 19] for at present unknown reasons. Biochemical and structural studies imply that batFLUAV-HAL, unlike FLUAV-HA, does not engage sialic acids (SA) for host cell entry [17, [22] [23] [24] , and that batFLUAV-NAL, unlike FLUAV-NA, neither shows neuraminidase activity nor possesses an active site that would allow interaction with sialic acids [17, [25] [26] [27] . However, it is currently unclear whether HAL and NAL can facilitate viral entry into certain target cells and it is unknown which determinants control the entry process.">

In contrast, HAL-driven entry was dependent on prior proteolytic activation of HAL and endosomal acidification. Moreover, we provide evidence that HAL can utilize the cellular protease TMPRSS2 for its activation, suggesting that bat-FLUAV entry into human cells is mainly restricted at the stage of receptor engagement while proteolytic activation and triggering of HAL are not limiting the entry process.">
