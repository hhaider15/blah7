Developing orally bioavailable peptide-based drugs remains a challenging task; however, macrocyclization of linear peptides can be an effective strategy to improve membrane permeability, proteolytic stability, oral bioavailability, and overall drug-like characteristics for this class. Significant advances in solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) have enabled the efficient construction of macrocyclic peptide and peptidomimetic libraries with macrolactamization being performed on-resin or in solution phase. The primary goal of this review is to summarize solid-phase cyclohexapeptide synthesis using the on-resin and solution-phase macrocyclization methodologies published since 2013. We also highlight their broad applications ranging from natural product total synthesis, synthetic methodology development, and medicinal chemistry, to drug development and analyses of conformational and physiochemical properties.

Coupling reagents in the azabenzotriazole class are the most commonly employed for cyclization of linear peptide precursors, as they give faster rates of cyclization with lower amounts of epimerization, typically less than 10% [4] . Moreover, linear peptides with the D-configuration at their C-terminal residue have favorable cyclization kinetics [4] . This may be a result of less steric hindrance during the formation of the peptide bond occurring between the D-and L-amino acids, particularly when bulky side chains are present. Cyclodepsipeptides, with one ester linkage in the macrocyclic backbone [9], have been utilized in the epimerization-free synthesis of cyclopeptides by employing a key O-N-acyl migration reaction at a serine residue [10, 11] .">

Moreover, peptide macrocyclization is a way of locking the peptide sequence in a Î²-strand conformation [15, 16] , a conformation often recognized by their enzyme targets, such as proteases [15, 16, 21] . Macrocycles are not completely rigid but still have a degree of flexibility, which facilitates interactions with their receptors [1] . Additionally, the entropic cost of receptor binding may be reduced for macrocyclic drugs compared to their linear equivalents as a result of conformational pre-organization [1] . N-Methylation of the cyclic peptide backbone has been shown in some cases to improve peptide metabolic stability [14, 22] and oral bioavailability [23] as a result of changes in peptide conformation or steric hindrance [22] . The immunosuppressant drug ciclosporin is a macrocyclic undecapeptide bearing seven N-methylated motifs and can be administered as an oral formulation [1, 22] . Modification of the cyclohexapeptide backbone to form cyclohexapeptoids can, in some cases, lead to an increase to cell permeability [24] . Most cyclic peptide drugs on the market today are administered parenterally, and only few are orally bioavailable [1], highlighting an ongoing challenge. For this reason, the synthesis and evaluation of novel cyclopeptide scaffolds to expand our understanding of their pharmacokinetic (PK) properties is still at the forefront of many research programs [2, 12, 23] .">

In general, excess reagents are used in solid-phase synthesis to help to drive reactions to completion. The solid-supported methodology allows excess reagents to be removed after each step by employing a simple filtration, and the final desired product is obtained after cleavage from the resin [25] . To date, many new advances in SPPS have allowed for the rapid and efficient construction of peptide or peptidomimetic [26] libraries for subsequent biological evaluation and high-throughput screening [27, 28] .">

The structures of these macrocycles have a wide-ranging incorporation of natural and unnatural amino acids as well as different ring sizes. Interestingly, cyclohexapeptides-macrocyclic peptides comprising six amino acids in the ring-are one of the most ubiquitous classes of macrocyclic peptides synthesized by SPPS. Macrocyclic hexapeptides can be obtained directly from on-resin or solution-phase cyclization following the cleavage of a linear hexapeptide precursor from resin ( Figure 1 ). This brief review summarizes the preceding five years' worth of solid-phase cyclohexapeptide synthesis and its applications, which span from natural product total synthesis, synthetic methodology development, and medicinal chemistry, to drug development and analyses of conformational and physiochemical properties.">
