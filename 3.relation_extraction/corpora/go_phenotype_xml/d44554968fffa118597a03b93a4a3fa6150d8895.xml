  <chunk id="d44554968fffa118597a03b93a4a3fa6150d8895.c1" text="Background: Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), which is characterized by severe watery diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration and a high mortality rate in piglets, leads to enormous economic losses to the pork industry and remains a large challenge worldwide. Thus, a rapid and reliable method is required for epidemiological investigations and to evaluate the effect of immunization. However, the current diagnostic methods for PEDV are time-consuming and very expensive and rarely meet the requirements for clinical application. Nanobodies have been used in the clinic to overcome these problems because of the advantages of their easy expression and high level of stability. In the present work, a novel biotinylated nanobody-based blocking ELISA (bELISA) was developed to detect anti-PEDV antibodies in clinical pig serum.">

Then, purified Nb2-Avi-tag fusion protein was biotinylated in vitro. A novel bELISA was subsequently developed for the first time with biotinylated Nb2. The cutoff value for bELISA was 29.27%. One hundred and fifty clinical serum samples were tested by both newly developed bELISA and commercial kits. The sensitivity and specificity of bELISA were 100% and 93.18%, respectively, and the coincidence rate between the two methods was 94%."/>
