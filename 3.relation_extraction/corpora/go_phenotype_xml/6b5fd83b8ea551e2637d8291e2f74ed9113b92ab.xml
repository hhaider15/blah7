  <chunk id="6b5fd83b8ea551e2637d8291e2f74ed9113b92ab.c1" text="A fully integrated paper microfluidic electrochemical device equipped with three different cation permeable films is developed to determine blood ions (Cl − , Na + , K + , and Ca 2+ ) at a time. These blood ions that are normally dissolved in the real human blood stream are essential for cell metabolisms and homeostasis in the human body. Abnormal concentration of blood ions causes many serious disorders. The optimized microfluidic device working without any external power source can directly and effectively separate human blood components, and subsequently detect a specific blood ion with minimized interference. The measured sensitivity to Cl − , K + , Na + , and Ca 2+ are −47.71, 45.97, 51.06, and 19.46 in mV decade −1 , respectively. Potentiometric responses of the microfluidic devices to blood serum samples are in the normal ranges of each cation, and comparable with responses from the commercial blood ion analyzer Abbott i-Stat.">

Glassy carbon and conducting polymer-based multidetection of human blood ions has been introduced [9]. However, direct detection of blood ions is still difficult and simultaneous detection of major human blood ions is even more challenging, because of the many other interfering materials, such as red blood cells, white blood cells, proteins, and hormones. These biological and chemical blockers coexist in the blood stream, and effectively screen precise detection of the ions [10, 11] ."/>

In this work, we integrate, for the first time, a wax-patterned paper microfluidic substrate, three cation permeable thin films allowing exclusive pathways for sodium, calcium, or potassium ions, and plastic cover plates into a paper-based total analysis system to simultaneously determine major human blood ions. Optimization and characterization of the wax patterns are conducted in terms of potentiometric sensitivity and response time. The major human blood ions, including Cl − , K + , Na + , and Ca 2+ , are physiological indices as indicators of human body disorders. Thus, an accurate determination of blood ions is of great importance to assess whether numerous metabolisms and homeostasis in the human body are working correctly.">
