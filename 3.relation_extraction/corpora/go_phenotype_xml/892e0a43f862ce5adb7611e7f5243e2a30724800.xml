Individuals carrying rhinovirus and H. influenzae-S. pneumoniae together were respectively twice and five times more likely to have respiratory symptoms. Individual with H. influenzae-K. pneumoniae carriage were twice (p = 0.04) as likely to develop a cough. The use of disposable handkerchiefs was associated with a decrease in the acquisition of S. aureus (aRR = 0.75, 95%CI [0.57-0.97]). Results could be used to identify pilgrims at increased risk of RTIs and acquisition of respiratory pathogens. Results also confirm the effectiveness of influenza and IPD vaccinations in reducing ILI symptoms and acquisition of S. pneumoniae carriage respectively.">

  <chunk id="892e0a43f862ce5adb7611e7f5243e2a30724800.c3" text="The Hajj is one of the largest annual religious mass gatherings in the world. Each year, Saudi Arabia attracts over 2 million pilgrims from over 180 countries, including about 2,000 from Marseille, France 1 . The Hajj presents major challenges in public health and infection control as the crowding conditions favor the acquisition, dissemination and transmission of pathogenic microorganisms 2 . Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are particularly frequent during the pilgrimage and are responsible for most causes of hospitalization, with community-acquired pneumonia being a major cause of serious illness among pilgrims 3 . Many studies have been conducted among Hajj pilgrims over the last decade, demonstrating the high prevalence of respiratory symptoms and the frequent acquisition of respiratory pathogens 3-7 . The viruses most commonly acquired after the Hajj are human rhinovirus (HRV), human coronaviruses (HCoV) and influenza A virus (IAV). The most frequently acquired respiratory bacteria are Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae), Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Haemophilus influenzae (H. influenzae) 3 . However, the etiology of RTIs at the Hajj is likely multifactorial and complex. The potential effects of vaccination against influenza and pneumococcus 8,9 , of non-pharmaceutical preventive measures including face-mask use and hand hygiene practice 10-12 have been investigated, mostly based on clinical criteria, but results of studies are contradictory.">

Relationship between respiratory symptoms and carriage of respiratory pathogens at the Hajj also remain poorly understood making it difficult distinguishing between infection and colonization. We conducted this www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ study to identify risk factors for respiratory symptoms and respiratory pathogens carriage at the Hajj, including socio-demographics, vaccination against influenza and invasive pneumococcal diseases (IPD) and adherence to non-pharmaceutical preventive measures using data collected from 2014 to 2017. We also evaluated the relationship between pathogen carriage, including multiple carriage and respiratory symptoms."/>
