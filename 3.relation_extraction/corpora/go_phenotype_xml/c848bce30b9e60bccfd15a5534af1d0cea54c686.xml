However, no reliable biomarkers are currently available for accurate early detection of ARDS in patients with predisposing conditions.">

After multivariate adjustment, sepsis (odds ratio [OR]:5.58, 95% CI: 1.70-18.3), pulmonary injury (OR: 3.22; 95% CI: 1.60-6.47), and thrombocytopenia, defined as platelet count ,80610 3 /mL, (OR: 2.67; 95% CI: 1.27-5.62)were significantly associated with increased risk of developing ARDS. Thrombocytopenia was also associated with increased mortality in patients who developed ARDS (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR]: 1.38, 95% CI: 1.07-1.57) but not in those who did not develop ARDS(AHR: 1.25, 95% CI: 0.96-1.62). The presence of both thrombocytopenia and ARDS substantially increased 60-daymortality. Sensitivity analyses showed that a platelet count of ,100610 3 /mLin combination with ARDS provide the highest prognostic value for mortality. These associations were replicated in the cohort of US patients.">
