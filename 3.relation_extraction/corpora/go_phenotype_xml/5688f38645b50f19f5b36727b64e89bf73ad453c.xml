The use of combination antifungal therapy in cases with a severe clinical course is increasing, although information on the efficacy and safety of this approach is limited.">

Medical records were retrospectively reviewed in order to describe patients' characteristics.">

The 12week treatment response rate was 69.2% (6/13 patients showed complete response, 3/13 partial response). The crude mortality was 30.7% (4/13): half was related to invasive mold infections (2/13, 15.38%) and half to disease progression (2/13, 15.38%). Overall, treatment was well tolerated, and we did not observe any permanent discontinuation of antifungals due to related side effects."/>

Well-designed studies are needed to confirm the safety of this approach and to better understand its efficacy in the pediatric setting."/>
