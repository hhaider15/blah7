The 2013-2016 outbreak in Western Africa caused unfathomable morbidity and mortality (over 11,000 deaths), and the second largest outbreak is on-going in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The first stage of an Ebolavirus infection is entry, culminating in delivery of the viral genome into the cytoplasm to initiate replication. Among enveloped viruses, Ebolaviruses use a complex entry pathway: they bind to attachment factors on cell surfaces, are engulfed by macropinocytosis, and traffic through the endosomal system. En route, the receptor binding subunit of the glycoprotein (GP) is reduced from~130 to~19 kDa by cathepsins. This event allows cleaved GP (GP cl ) to bind to Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1), its endosomal receptor. The virus then fuses with a late endosomal membrane, but how this occurs remains a subject of debate. An early, but standing, observation is that entry of particles bearing GP cl is inhibited by agents that raise endosomal pH or inhibit cysteine proteases, suggesting the need for an additional factor(s). Yet, some have concluded that NPC1 is sufficient to trigger the fusion activity of GP cl . Here, we re-examined this question using sensitive cell-cell and pseudovirus-cell fusion assays. We did not observe detectable GP cl -mediated fusion with NPC1 or its GP cl binding domain at any pH tested, while robust fusion was consistently observed with GP from lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus at low pH. Addition of proposed fusion-enhancing factors-cations (Ca ++ and K + ), a reducing agent, the anionic lipid Bis(Monoacylglycero) Phosphate, and a mixture of cathepsins B and L-did not induce detectable fusion. Our findings are in line with the earlier proposal that an additional factor is required to trigger the full fusion activity of GP cl after binding to NPC1. We discuss caveats to our study and what the missing factor(s) might be.">

GP is a class I fusion protein present at the surface of the virion as a trimer of heterodimers, each comprised of two subunits linked by a disulfide bond: the highly glycosylated receptor-binding subunit (GP1) and the fusion subunit (GP2). After internalization through a macropinocytotic pathway [3, 4] , GP1 is cleaved at low pH by endosomal cysteine-proteases, namely cathepsins B and L, removing the mucin domain and glycan cap and producing a cleaved form of GP1 (~19 kDa) [5] [6] [7] . Then GP1 binds to its intracellular receptor, Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1), a cholesterol transporter located in late endosomes/lysosomes [8-10]. The utilization of intracellular viral receptors is a fairly new concept in virology, with all known filoviruses employing NPC1 and the arenavirus, Lassa virus (LASV), using Lamp1 [2, [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . While Lamp1 is thought to raise the pH-threshold for fusion [13, 14] , the exact role of NPC1 in EBOV entry is yet to be determined. It is postulated that after binding to NPC1, cathepsin-cleaved GP (GP cl ) undergoes further conformational changes empowering GP2 to mediate fusion [16] .">

  <chunk id="089acb4677633e0cf2d35fd728e686c8aa887bc0.c4" text="The factors needed to trigger the fusion activity of GP cl remain under debate. Early work showed that host cell entry mediated by GP cl remains sensitive to lysosomotropic agents and the cysteine protease inhibitor E64d [6] . These findings suggested that GP cl requires low pH and an additional activity inhibited by E64d, perhaps additional cathepsin cleavage, to trigger its fusion ability. Additional cell biological [17] [18] [19] [20] and biochemical studies [21-24] supported this concept. Furthermore, findings stated in [10] suggested that low pH and engagement of the C-loop of NPC1, the binding domain for GP cl within NPC1, are not sufficient to trigger fusion. The endosomal two pore calcium channel 2 (TPC2) was subsequently identified as a late entry factor for EBOV [25] , but its exact role in fusion is not known. In contrast to the literature cited above suggesting needs for low pH, NPC1, and an additional factor(s) to support GP cl -mediated fusion, Markosyan et al. [26] proposed that binding to NPC1 is sufficient to induce GP cl to induce fusion, even at neutral pH.">

The assays employed included highly sensitive luciferase-based cell-cell and pseudoviruscell fusion assays, as well as a flow cytometric-based assay for cell-cell hemifusion. Our findings suggest that neither the NPC1-C-loop nor full-length NPC1 are sufficient to trigger significant fusion at any pH tested. Even the presence of additional factors including a reducing agent, a negatively charged lipid abundant in late endosomes/lysosomes, cathepsins, or the cations Ca + + and K + did not elicit detectable fusion. Taken together, our results suggest that cathepsin primed EBOV-GP requires one or more factors in addition to NPC1 and low pH to mediate a fusion reaction sufficiently robust to allow entry of the EBOV genome into the cytoplasm to initiate replication.">
