  <chunk id="4a99bf8fae88d43868e5b8ec0fa4c1c375b951f7.c1" text="Background: HIV/AIDS is one of the most stigmatized medical conditions across the world. Self-stigma is prevalent among people living with HIV (PLHIV) and a major obstacle to HIV prevention and care."/>
  <chunk id="4a99bf8fae88d43868e5b8ec0fa4c1c375b951f7.c2" text="Objective: This study aimed to describe the experiences of stigmatization and explore the possible factors that might be associated with stigmatization among PLHIV in Hong Kong."/>

  <chunk id="4a99bf8fae88d43868e5b8ec0fa4c1c375b951f7.c4" text="Setting and participants: 15 PLHIV were recruited from two local non-governmental organizations on HIV prevention."/>
  <chunk id="4a99bf8fae88d43868e5b8ec0fa4c1c375b951f7.c5" text="Participants were interviewed about their views and feelings towards oneself as a PLHIV and contributing factors, experiences of discriminations, stigmatizing behaviours, issues about disclosure, social relationships and potential impact of HIV."/>
  <chunk id="4a99bf8fae88d43868e5b8ec0fa4c1c375b951f7.c6" text="Thematic analyses revealed three levels of factors which might be associated with stigmatization: (i) intrapersonal level (misconceptions about HIV, attribution of self-responsibility, severe state of illness, side-effects of medication), (ii) interpersonal level (discrimination, social rejection) and (iii) social level (mass media, public stereotypes). Findings provide important insights into which interventions to reduce stigmatization of PLHIV could be designed.">
