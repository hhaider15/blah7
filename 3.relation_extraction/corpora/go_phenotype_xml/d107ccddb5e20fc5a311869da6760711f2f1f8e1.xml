They were devoid of antiviral activity; however, several phosphonates were found slightly cytostatic against HeLa cells at an IC50 in the 80-210 µM range. Compounds (1R,2S)-17k and (1S,2S)-17k showed the highest inhibitory effects (IC50 = 15-30 µM) against the proliferation of murine leukemia (L1210) and human T-lymphocyte (CEM) cell lines.">
