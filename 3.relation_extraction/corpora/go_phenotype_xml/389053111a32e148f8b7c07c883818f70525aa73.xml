  <chunk id="389053111a32e148f8b7c07c883818f70525aa73.c1" text="We demonstrate an integrated micro-optofluidic platform for real-time, continuous detection and quantification of airborne microorganisms. Measurements of the fluorescence and light scattering from single particles in a microfluidic channel are used to determine the total particle number concentration and the microorganism number concentration in real-time. The system performance is examined by evaluating standard particle measurements with various sample flow rates and the ratios of fluorescent to non-fluorescent particles. To apply this method to real-time detection of airborne microorganisms, airborne Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, and Staphylococcus epidermidis cells were introduced into the micro-optofluidic platform via bioaerosol generation, and a liquid-type particle collection setup was used. We demonstrate successful discrimination of SYTO82-dyed fluorescent bacterial cells from other residue particles in a continuous and real-time manner. In comparison with traditional microscopy cell counting and colony culture methods, this micro-optofluidic platform is not only more accurate in terms of the detection efficiency for airborne microorganisms but it also provides additional information on the total particle number concentration."/>

Because of the low settling velocities due to the small size of particles (~20 nm to 100 Î¼ m), such bioaerosols may be suspended in the atmosphere for a prolonged period, and can be carried over large distances 2 . Therefore, there is significant potential for inhalation into the human respiratory system, which has health consequences 3 . There have been many studies on the health effects of exposure to harmful bioaerosols, such as infectious diseases, pneumonia, asthma, and allergies 4,5 . The increased use of buildings that are isolated from external ventilation brings about increased risk of exposure to bioaerosols 6,7 . Outdoor workers in the recycling industry are often exposed to high concentrations of bioaerosols 8, 9 . The recent pandemic outbreaks of H1N1 influenza A and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) demonstrate the importance of bioaerosol monitoring and control 10-12 .">

Several epidemiological studies have demonstrated links between airborne microorganisms and health problems. The airborne concentration of culturable microorganisms (i.e., colony-forming units (CFUs) per cubic meter of air) is a particularly widely used indicator, and is a simple parameter that can be used in the quantification of air quality 4,7,13,14 . For example, the World Health Organization (WHO) has suggested guidelines regarding the maximum allowable airborne fungal count (i.e., &lt; 500 CFU/m 3 ) 15 ."/>
