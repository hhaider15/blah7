  <chunk id="43918c75d7b7d3f9402b1342dfea1e19eb2bd909.c1" text="The bactericidal activity of conventional titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) photocatalyst is effective only on irradiation by ultraviolet light, which restricts the applications of TiO 2 for use in living environments. Recently, carbon-containing TiO 2 nanoparticles [TiO 2 (C) NP] were found to be a visible-light-responsive photocatalyst (VLRP), which displayed significantly enhanced antibacterial properties under visible light illumination. However, whether TiO 2 (C) NPs exert antibacterial properties against Bacillus anthracis remains elusive. Here, we evaluated these VLRP NPs in the reduction of anthrax-induced pathogenesis. Bacteria-killing experiments indicated that a significantly higher proportion (40%-60%) of all tested Bacillus species, including B. subtilis, B. cereus, B. thuringiensis, and B. anthracis, were considerably eliminated by TiO 2 (C) NPs. Toxin inactivation analysis further suggested that the TiO 2 (C) NPs efficiently detoxify approximately 90% of tested anthrax lethal toxin, a major virulence factor of anthrax. Notably, macrophage clearance experiments further suggested that, even under suboptimal conditions without considerable bacterial killing, the TiO 2 (C) NP-mediated photocatalysis still exhibited antibacterial properties through the reduction of bacterial resistance against macrophage killing. Our results collectively suggested that TiO 2 (C) NP is a conceptually feasible anti-anthrax material, and the relevant technologies described herein may be useful in the development of new strategies against anthrax."/>
