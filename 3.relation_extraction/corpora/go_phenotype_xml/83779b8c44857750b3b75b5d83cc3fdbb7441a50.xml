  <chunk id="83779b8c44857750b3b75b5d83cc3fdbb7441a50.c1" text="Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is an enteric disease in swine caused by an alphacoronavirus. It affects swine of all ages causing acute diarrhoea and can lead to severe dehydration and death in suckling piglets. Being recognized for the first time in Europe and Asia during the seventies and the eighties, respectively, it has remained a relevant cause of diarrhea outbreaks in Asia for years and to the present. It has become a major concern in swine production since 2013 when the virus was detected for first time in the USA and in other American countries causing a high number of pig deaths and significant economic losses. The present review aims at approaching the reader to the state of the art of PED giving answer to some of the most recent questions which have arisen related to this disease.">
