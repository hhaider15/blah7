Here we focused on the interplay between IAV and DExD-box RNA helicases (DDX), which play a key role in cellular RNA metabolism by remodeling RNA-RNA or RNA-protein complexes. We performed a targeted RNAi screen on 35 human DDX proteins to identify those involved in IAV life cycle. DDX19 was a major hit. In DDX19-depleted cells the accumulation of viral RNAs and proteins was delayed, and the production of infectious IAV particles was strongly reduced. We show that DDX19 associates with intronless, unspliced and spliced IAV mRNAs and promotes their nuclear export. In addition, we demonstrate an RNA-independent association between DDX19 and the viral polymerase, that is modulated by the ATPase activity of DDX19. Our results provide a model in which DDX19 is recruited to viral mRNAs in the nucleus of infected cells to enhance their nuclear export. Information gained from this virus-host interaction improves the understanding of both the IAV replication cycle and the cellular function of DDX19.">

  <chunk id="3ccac237e5fa57c9d28f59f0b9b8e58188edd29b.c3" text="RNA viruses have relatively small genomes that encode a limited number of proteins, and have evolved so that they hijack cellular components and cellular pathways to facilitate their replication. In particular, a growing list of RNA viruses were found to co-opt DDX proteins to support various steps of their life cycle. For instance, the HIV-1 Rev protein associates with DDX3, which together with DDX1 promotes the Rev-dependent nuclear export of unspliced and singly-spliced viral mRNAs 4 . Although the HCV genome encodes a viral RNA helicase, DDX3, DDX1 and DDX6 are required for efficient HCV genomic RNA replication 5 . The DDX1 protein was shown to interact with the Nsp14 exonuclease of coronaviruses and to facilitate their replication 6 . The DDX proteins may also be involved at later stages of viral infection, as exemplified by the role of DDX24 in the packaging of HIV-1 RNA during virus assembly 7 or the role of DDX56 in the assembly of West Nile virus particles 8 . In addition several DDX helicases have been involved in anti-viral innate immunity, mostly as sensors. This is notably the case for DDX58, also named RIG-I, but also for DDX3, DDX41, DDX1, DDX21 and DDX60 9 .">
