  <chunk id="80850d03f16060e460bd50e5622e2196c0622f54.c1" text="In this study, we describe a web-based resource, developed for assisting the scientific community in designing an effective therapeutics against the Ebola virus. Firstly, we predicted and identified experimentally validated epitopes in each of the antigens/proteins of the five known ebolaviruses. Secondly, we generated all the possible overlapping 9mer peptides from the proteins of ebolaviruses. Thirdly, conserved peptides across all the five ebolaviruses (four human pathogenic species) with no identical sequence in the human proteome, based on 1000 Genomes project, were identified. Finally, we identified peptide or epitope-based vaccine candidates that could activate both the B-and T-cell arms of the immune system. In addition, we also identified efficacious siRNAs against the mRNA transcriptome (absent in human transcriptome) of all the five ebolaviruses. It was observed that three species can potentially be targeted by a single siRNA (19mer) and 75 siRNAs can potentially target at least two species. A web server, EbolaVCR, has been developed that incorporates all the above information and useful computational tools (http://crdd.osdd.net/oscadd/ebola/)."/>

It can infect both animals and humans. The medium of transmission of this virus is mainly body fluids such as milk, saliva, semen, urine, etc. The Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) is characterized by abrupt fever, stomach pain, headache, vomiting, and diarrhea 2 . Because the EVD has overlapping symptoms with other diseases such as malaria, flu and typhoid, it makes it all the more complicated to diagnose the infection from the symptoms 3 . The onset of the disease is confirmed using ELISA, PCR and virus isolation test 4 .">

Even so, there are limited options to treat this disease directly. Recently, ZMapp was invented against the Ebola virus (EBOV), which is a combination of 3 monoclonal antibodies 6,7 . Although it has not been tested in humans, successful animal studies have been carried out 8 . To the best of the authors' knowledge, there is no known approved vaccine against this disease available at the moment 9 ."/>

The first candidate (ChAd3-ZEBOV) has been developed by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) 11 . This vaccine comprises a glycoprotein gene from EBOV and Sudan Ebola Virus (SUDV) under the control of chimpanzee adenovirus 3. The second potential vaccine is rVSV-ZEBOV, developed by NewLink Genetics and Merck Vaccines USA in collaboration with the Public Health Agency of Canada that uses attenuated virus with glycoprotein of EBOV 12 . The rVSV-ZEBOV was found to be safe and effective in clinical trial results 13 .">

A siRNA targeting the Zaire Ebola virus RNA polymerase L protein formulated in stable nucleic acid-lipid particles (SNALPs) showed complete protection in guinea pigs 16 . In a separate study, the authors have used a combination of siRNAs targeting L, VP24 and VP35 formulated in SNALPs and observed protection in two-third of the rhesus monkeys and in all macaques who were given seven post exposure treatments 17 . TKM-100802 is a set of small RNA molecules encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles that target the vital viral proteins (VP24, VP35, and L) and cleave viral RNA in the cells and prevent its multiplication 16, 17 . A recent study shows that short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) packaged into lipid nanoparticles are able to protect all the rhesus monkeys under experimental design against Makona strain outbreak of Ebola virus 18 .">
