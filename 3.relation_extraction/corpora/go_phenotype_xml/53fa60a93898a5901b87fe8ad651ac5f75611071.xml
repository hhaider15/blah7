  <chunk id="53fa60a93898a5901b87fe8ad651ac5f75611071.c1" text=". Verifica*on of siRNA knockdown experiments using addi*onal siRNAs. (A) Knockdown efficiency of two different ISG15 siRNAs. A549 cells were transfected with 10nM of either control (ctrl) siRNA or the indicated ISG15 siRNA, followed by 24hour treatment with 1000IU/ml human IFN-Î². Cell extracts were analyzed by immunoblots with the indicated Abs. ISG15 #1 siRNA is the siRNA used for the knockdown experiments described in the text. (B) ISG15 knockdown using ISG15 siRNA#2, like ISG15 siRNA#1, rescued the replica*on of 67 mutant virus (C) Knockdown efficiency of two different USP18 siRNAs as assayed by USP18 immunoblots of siRNA-transfected, IFN-treated A549 cells. USP18 siRNA #1 was used.in the experiments described in the text (D) USP18 siRNA #2, like USP18 siRNA#1, enhanced ISGyla*on and inhibited HA and NP protein produc*on in 67 mutant-infected cells. Related to Figures 1 and 4. "/>
