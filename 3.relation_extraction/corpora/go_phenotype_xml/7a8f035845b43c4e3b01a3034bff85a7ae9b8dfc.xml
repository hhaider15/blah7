Although initially considered a self-limited benign infection, a panoply of neurologic complications were recognized including a Guillain-BarrÃ©-like syndrome and in-utero fetal infection causing microcephaly, blindness, and other congenital neurologic complications.

Here we review the current landscape and challenges confronting Zika virus vaccine development.">
