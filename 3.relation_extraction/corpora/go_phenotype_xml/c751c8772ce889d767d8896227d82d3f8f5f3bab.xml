A mixed strategy profile σ (·) is a function that maps the state s ∈ {0, 1} n to the space of probability distributions on the actions space, i.e., σ i : {0, 1} n → ([0, 1]). The definition of a mixed MMPE strategy profile σ * := {σ * i : {0, 1} n → [0, 1]} is a distribution on the action space that satisfies the following, for all t = 1, 2, . . . , and i ∈ N ,"/>
