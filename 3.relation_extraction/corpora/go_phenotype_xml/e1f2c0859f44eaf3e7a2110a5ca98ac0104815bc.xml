  <chunk id="e1f2c0859f44eaf3e7a2110a5ca98ac0104815bc.c1" text="Background: The use of biomaterials has been expanded to improve the characteristics of vaccines. Recently we have identified that the peptide PH (1-110) from polyhedrin self-aggregates and incorporates foreign proteins to form particles. We have proposed that this peptide can be used as an antigen carrying system for vaccines. However, the immune response generated by the antigen fused to the peptide has not been fully characterized. In addition, the adjuvant effect and thermostability of the particles has not been evaluated.">

  <chunk id="e1f2c0859f44eaf3e7a2110a5ca98ac0104815bc.c2" text="Results: In the present study we demonstrate the use of a system developed to generate nano and microparticles carrying as a fusion protein peptides or proteins of interest to be used as vaccines. These particles are purified easily by centrifugation. Immunization of animals with the particles in the absence of adjuvant result in a robust and long-lasting immune response. Proteins contained inside the particles are maintained for over 1 year at ambient temperature, preserving their immunological properties."/>

The thermostability conferred by the particle system facilitates the distribution of the vaccines in developing countries or areas with no electricity.">
