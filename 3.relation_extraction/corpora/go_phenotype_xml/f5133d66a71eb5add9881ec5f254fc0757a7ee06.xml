  <chunk id="f5133d66a71eb5add9881ec5f254fc0757a7ee06.c1" text="Background: In infectious disease surveillance, when the laboratory confirmation of the cases is time-consuming, there is often a time lag between the number of suspect cases and the number of confirmed cases. This study proposes a dynamic statistical model to estimate the daily number of new cases and the daily cumulative number of infected cases, which was then applied to historic dengue fever data.">

  <chunk id="f5133d66a71eb5add9881ec5f254fc0757a7ee06.c2" text="The duration between the date of disease onset and date of laboratory confirmation was assumed to follow a gamma distribution or a nonparametric distribution. A conditional probability of a case being a real case among the unconfirmed cases on a given date was then calculated. This probability along with the observed confirmed cases was integrated to estimate the daily number of new cases and the cumulative number of infected cases.">

The daily new cases and cumulative epidemic curves estimated by the proposed method have a lower absolute relative bias than the values estimated solely based on the available daily-confirmed cases."/>
  <chunk id="f5133d66a71eb5add9881ec5f254fc0757a7ee06.c4" text="The proposed method provides a more accurate real-time estimation of the daily new cases and daily cumulative number of infected cases. The model makes use of the most recent &quot;moving window&quot; of information relative to suspect cases and dynamically updates the parameters. The proposed method will be useful for the realtime evaluation of a disease outbreak when case classification requires a time-consuming laboratory process to identify a confirmed case."/>
