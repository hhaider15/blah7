  <chunk id="3bac7494aeafbb2f2cff25690dac67e99c120029.c1" text="Background: Goose parvovirus (GPV) is a Dependovirus associated with latent infection and mortality in geese. Currently, it severely affects geese production worldwide. The objective of this study was to develop a fluorescent quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (FQ-PCR) assay for fast and accurate quantification of GPV DNA in infected goslings, which can aid in the understanding of the regular distribution pattern and the nosogenesis of GPV in vivo.">

The realtime PCR was reproducible, as shown by satisfactory low intraassay and interassay coefficients of variation."/>
