  <chunk id="4a5e7d2f1256d0aed03adae0c98c5bb522e28748.c1" text="The discovery of potent therapeutic compounds against dengue virus is urgently needed. The NS2B-NS3 protease (NS2B-NS3 pro ) of dengue fever virus carries out all enzymatic activities needed for polyprotein processing and is considered to be amenable to antiviral inhibition by analogy. Virtual screening of 300,000 compounds using Autodock 3 on the GVSS platform was conducted to identify novel inhibitors against the NS2B-NS3 pro . Thirty-six compounds were selected for in vitro assay against NS2B-NS3 pro expressed in Pichia pastoris. Seven novel compounds were identified as inhibitors with IC 50 values of 3.9 ± 0.6-86.7 ± 3.6 μM. Three strong NS2B-NS3 pro inhibitors were further confirmed as competitive inhibitors with K i values of 4.0 ± 0.4, 4.9 ± 0.3, and 3.4 ± 0.1 μM, respectively. Hydrophobic and hydrogen bond interactions between amino acid residues in the NS3 pro active site with inhibition compounds were also identified.">
