To date the mechanism for how MxA exerts its antiviral activity is unclear, however, additional cellular factors are believed to be essential for this activity. To identify MxA cofactors we performed a genome-wide siRNA-based screen in human airway epithelial cells (A549) constitutively expressing MxA using an H5N1 reporter virus. These data were complemented with a proteomic screen to identify MxA-interacting proteins. The combined data identified SMARCA2, the ATPase subunit of the BAF chromatin remodeling complex, as a crucial factor required for the antiviral activity of MxA against IAV. Intriguingly, our data demonstrate that although SMARCA2 is essential for expression of some IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), and the establishment of an antiviral state, it is not required for expression of MxA, suggesting an indirect effect on MxA activity. Transcriptome analysis of SMARCA2-depleted A549-MxA cells identified a small set of SMARCA2-regulated factors required for activity of MxA, in particular IFITM2 and IGFBP3. These findings reveal that several virus-inducible factors work in concert to enable MxA restriction of IAV. NP) has been made and imported into the nucleus, the viral polymerase switches to synthesis of complementary RNA which is encapsidated into complementary RNPs (cRNPs) during this process. These cRNPs in turn serve as intermediates for synthesis of new vRNPs which are finally exported from the nucleus to be packaged into new viral particles at the plasma membrane 4 .">

After recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns, such as viral RNA, the cell responds by secreting type I and III interferons. These interferons bind to their respective receptors leading to JAK-STAT signaling and eventually to induction of several hundred interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), of which some have direct effector activity against particular viruses 7 . The speed of the antiviral response is critical to prevent further virus spread. Therefore, most ISG promoters, which would otherwise be covered by nucleosomes and not be available for immediate access, are &quot;primed&quot; for rapid transcriptional activation through the bound SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex (BAF complex) 8 . The promotor-bound BAF complex not only facilitates rapid induction but also basal level expression and, upon stimulation, induction of ISGs to a higher extent.">

Its importance is further emphasized by the fact that all human-adapted IAVs, including all pandemic viruses, have evolved partial resistance towards MxA antiviral activity through mutations in their NP 9 . MxA belongs to the family of large dynamin-like GTPases and localizes to the cytoplasm, in contrast to IAV replication which occurs in the nucleus. To date, the mechanism by which MxA inhibits IAV replication is still unclear and somewhat controversial 12,13 . However, there is general agreement that a very early step of the IAV replication cycle is affected [14] [15] [16] .">

However, while NP of the closely related Thogoto virus (THOV) can be co-precipitated with MxA, similar approaches with IAV NP have failed to show a convincing interaction 19 . Therefore, it is hypothesized that the IAV NP-MxA interaction is of low affinity and may require the presence of additional host cell factors 13, 19, 20 .">
