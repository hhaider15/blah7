Innate immunity is the first line of defense against invading pathogens, but relatively little is understood regarding host intrinsic mechanisms that guard against ZIKV. Here, we show that host tripartite motif-containing protein 56 (TRIM56) poses a barrier to ZIKV infection in cells of neural, epithelial and fibroblast origins. Overexpression of TRIM56, but not an E3 ligase-dead mutant or one lacking a short C-terminal portion, inhibited ZIKV RNA replication. Conversely, depletion of TRIM56 increased viral RNA levels. Although the C-terminal region of TRIM56 bears sequence homology to NHL repeat of TRIM-NHL proteins that regulate miRNA activity, knockout of Dicer, which abolishes production of miRNAs, had no demonstrable effect on ZIKV restriction imposed by TRIM56. Rather, we found that TRIM56 is an RNA-binding protein that associates with ZIKV RNA in infected cells. Moreover, a recombinant TRIM56 fragment comprising the C-terminal 392 residues captured ZIKV RNA in cell-free reactions, indicative of direct interaction. Remarkably, deletion of a short C-terminal tail portion abrogated the TRIM56-ZIKV RNA interaction, concomitant with a loss in antiviral activity. Altogether, our study reveals TRIM56 is an RNA binding protein that acts as a ZIKV restriction factor and provides new insights into the antiviral mechanism by which this E3 ligase tackles flavivirus infections.">

  <chunk id="576b829eeb6838282aa2ffdfa925301e2888bb9f.c3" text="The E3 ligase TRIM56 was previously shown to inhibit the replication of several viruses in the family Flaviviridae, including dengue virus serotype 2, yellow fever virus and bovine viral diarrhea virus, but had not demonstrable antiviral effect against hepatitis C virus, a hepatotropic virus in the same family. Nonetheless, the antiviral mechanism remains unclear and whether TRIM56 restricts other flaviviruses remains to be determined. In this study we demonstrated that TRIM56 inhibits ZIKVs of Asian and African lineages and a dengue virus serotype 1 replicon. We additionally uncovered that TRIM56 is an RNAbinding protein and that a portion of the C-terminal NHL-like domain mediates the association of TRIM56 with ZIKV RNAs in infected cells. Importantly, the RNA-binding activity of TRIM56 was found to be required for its antiviral function, although it alone is insufficient. In contrast, TRIM56 restricted ZIKV in Dicer-deficient cells, indicating an antiviral mechanism independent of miRNA regulation, a function known to be associated with NHL-containing proteins. In aggregate, our work identifies TRIM56 as a novel restriction factor of ZIKV and sheds new lights on the antiviral mechanism of TRIM56 against flaviviruses.">
