  <chunk id="a02952893a51f2255a8d9d84b3eba6fe1b113996.c1" text="We designed and produced a self-assembling protein nanoparticle. This self-assembling protein nanoparticle contains five CD8 + HLA-A03-11 supertypes-restricted epitopes from antigens expressed during Toxoplasma gondii's lifecycle, the universal CD4 + T cell epitope PADRE, and flagellin as a scaffold and TLR5 agonist. These CD8 + T cell epitopes were separated by N/KAAA spacers and optimized for proteasomal cleavage. Self-assembling protein nanoparticle adjuvanted with TLR4 ligand-emulsion GLA-SE were evaluated for their efficacy in inducing IFN-γ responses and protection of HLA-A*1101 transgenic mice against T. gondii. Immunization, using self-assembling protein nanoparticle-GLA-SE, activated CD8 + T cells to produce IFN-γ. Self-assembling protein nanoparticle-GLA-SE also protected HLA-A*1101 transgenic mice against subsequent challenge with Type II parasites. Hence, combining CD8 + T cell-eliciting peptides and PADRE into a multi-epitope protein that forms a nanoparticle, administered with GLA-SE, leads to efficient presentation by major histocompatibility complex Class I and II molecules. Furthermore, these results suggest that activation of TLR4 and TLR5 could be useful for development of vaccines that elicit T cells to prevent toxoplasmosis in humans.">
