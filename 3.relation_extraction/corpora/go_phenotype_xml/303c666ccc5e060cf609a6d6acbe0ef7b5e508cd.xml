  <chunk id="303c666ccc5e060cf609a6d6acbe0ef7b5e508cd.c1" text="Our understanding of non-coding RNA has significantly changed based on recent advances in genomics and molecular biology, and their role is recognized to include far more than a link between the sequence of DNA and synthesized proteins. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small regulatory RNAs that play a crucial role in posttranscriptional gene regulation. Greater than 2500 miRNAs have been identified and catalogued in humans and many of them are conserved in other species [1] . miRNAs are implicated in almost every facet of fundamental cellular functions including development, senescence and disease. The past decade has experienced a remarkable increase in the understanding of miRNA biogenesis, their target genes, miRNA biomarkers and potential therapeutics for a growing number of disease conditions. RNA-based markers and therapeutics have a potentially significant clinical impact, and many of the miRNA-based therapies are at various stages of application and human clinical trial [2] ."/>
  <chunk id="303c666ccc5e060cf609a6d6acbe0ef7b5e508cd.c2" text="As background, non-coding RNAs are divided into (i) transcription RNAs (including both tRNA and rRNA); (ii) small RNAs, which are further subdivided into siRNAs, miRNAs, snoRNAs, and snRNAs; and (iii) most recently, long non-coding RNAs, which are now know to transcribe short peptides [3] . MicroRNAs are single-stranded non-coding RNAs that are typically 18-25 nucleotides (nts) in length and are best known for their role in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. They are the most abundant class of small endogenous non-protein coding RNAs, and make up one of the largest well-conserved gene families found among viruses, plants and animals. The majority of miRNA sequences in humans are typically transcribed by introns of non-coding and coding transcripts, with few transcribed by exonic regions.">

  <chunk id="303c666ccc5e060cf609a6d6acbe0ef7b5e508cd.c3" text="MicroRNA genes are typically transcribed by polymerase II or III and generate primary miRNAs (pri-miRNAs), which can contain sequences for multiple miRNAs and be hundreds of nts in length. These structures are then processed and cleaved by Drosha-DGCR8 complex, resulting in the formation of a hairpin-shaped stem-loop structure, which is known as the precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA) and typically around 70 nts in length. The pre-miRNA is exported outside of the nucleus primarily by exportin 5. Further processing takes place in the cytoplasm by Dicer1-TARBP2, which is an RNase III enzyme, resulting in a two-stranded duplex of miRNA-miRNA*. Typically, it is 18-25 nt long, with one strand designated the guide strand and the other as the passenger strand. Finally, the guide strand is incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which is a large multiprotein miRNA ribonucleoprotein complex that is the effector compound in modulating target gene transcription. Alternative pathways have been described that are Drosha-DGCR8 independent as well as Dicer-independent, and are likely to greatly advance our understanding of miRNA biogenesis and involvement in conditions of health and disease.">
