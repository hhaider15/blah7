Current vaccines are restricted to inactivated vaccine strains and their related variants. In this study, a recombinant H9N2 (H9N2-TM) strain with a replaced H3 hemagglutinin (HA) transmembrane (TM) domain was generated. Virus assembly and viral protein composition were not affected by the transmembrane domain replacement. Further, the recombinant TM-replaced H9N2-TM virus could provide better inter-clade protection in both mice and chickens against H9N2, suggesting that the H3-TM-replacement could be considered as a strategy to develop efficient subtypespecific H9N2 influenza vaccines.">

Since then, it became prevalent in poultry farming worldwide, resulting in egg production reduction and high mortality when co-infected with other pathogens 2,3 . Also, it could cross host-species barrier and cause human infections as reported in China 4,5 . Though it is not highly pathogenic as H5N1, researches revealed that it could re-assort with multiple other influenza subtypes and thus be &quot;gene donor&quot; for H5N1 and H7N9 viruses 6-8 . Therefore, control of the H9N2 influenza virus is of great concern."/>

However, the vaccine strains and their antigenic variants undergoing antigenic drift were responsible for the outbreak of H9N2 in the poultry farming of China during 2010-2013 9 . Lack of cross-immune protection in the existing vaccines becomes a severe problem of effective protection against the virus. Thus, a broad-spectrum vaccine which can provide cross-protection against different antigenic H9N2 variants is in urgent need.">

Hemagglutinin (HA) is recognized as the major surface antigen. It is critical for viral attachment and membrane fusion. These are key steps for virus's entre into cells and critical to further process of virus infection 11, 12 . Transmembrane (TM) domain of the HA protein serves as an anchor site and plays an important role in supporting viral fusion to the target membrane 13 . In acidic environment, substitution of the TM domain showed an abolishment of receptor binding and membrane fusion, leading to a failure of virus entry into the cells 14, 15 . In addition, this domain was found to be important for biological characteristics of the influenza viruses, such as viral replication, virulence and pathogenicity [16] [17] [18] . Our previous research showed that substitutions of cysteines in the HA TM domain and a replacement with the H3-HA transmembrane (TM) domain could enhance heterosubtypic protection (hetero-protection) in mice 19 .
