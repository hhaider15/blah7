There has been a flurry of activity in the recent year on the subject of forecasting infectious disease outbreaks. Researchers have studied a diverse set of methods that range from classical methods in forecasting time series, to the use of sophisticated mechanistic models. Progress has also been made on the data front wherein diverse data sets have been collected and investigated in terms of their utility to forecast infectious disease dynamics. Recent progress has also been made using ensemble techniques to improve the quality of forecasting. Results have primarily been computational in nature and have shown that forecasting infectious disease might often be possible. In contrast to this, very little work has been undertaken to establish the inherent limits on forecasting."/>
  <chunk id="02b20ad26d6b2f05b38712292186edbf3aa05862.c2" text="The paper by Scarpino and Petri is a step in this direction. The authors study the information theoretic limits to forecasting infectious disease outbreaks. They use permutation entropy as the method of their choice to study this question. Using diverse time series data on a number of diseases, they investigate this important question."/>
  <chunk id="02b20ad26d6b2f05b38712292186edbf3aa05862.c3" text="The paper finds that although forecasting might indeed be feasible, the time horizon over which these forecasts are made depends on both shifting model structure and social network evolution. They conclude that one needs to move beyond simple time series based methods for forecasting and develop dynamic mechanistic models."/>
  <chunk id="02b20ad26d6b2f05b38712292186edbf3aa05862.c4" text="The paper uses permutation entropy to investigate the fundamental limits of forecasting epidemic dynamics. It can make a potentially important point but needs to be revised substantially before it can be accepted for publication. I have provided suggestions for the same. 1. Clarifying the definitions: The level of details provided as regards to how entropy was computed, the Markov chain and the SIR model require substantial details. While some details are provided and I can guess how this is done, it makes it harder to have confidence in my understanding without these details. They are needed since the results critically depend on it. Some examples: what is T, how do you set up τ (was set to 1 as said in the appendix), details on the Markov chain (beyond what is provided). Formal definitions can be given in some cases, in other cases well crafted examples can suffice."/>
  <chunk id="02b20ad26d6b2f05b38712292186edbf3aa05862.c5" text="A particular definition that needs clarification is the way you make a time series out of the basic definition of permutation entropy (PE). This is not described. As stated PE is simply a number. Based on the article, this is presumably done by having a sliding window that plots the PE as a time series. More importantly, how does one compute the probability; only within the window or over the entire time series."/>
  <chunk id="02b20ad26d6b2f05b38712292186edbf3aa05862.c6" text="Clarifying how models are developed: The way SIR model was constructed was not clear. At one level this is easy. But there is very little discussion of the probability of transmission which clearly has a role in the overall system dynamics. If one used a random graph model then the rationale for using it is unclear."/>
  <chunk id="02b20ad26d6b2f05b38712292186edbf3aa05862.c7" text="Charts, etc: The captions for the charts etc. should be improved from the standpoint of explaining the results."/>
  <chunk id="02b20ad26d6b2f05b38712292186edbf3aa05862.c8" text="• First: comparing the results with results produced by an SIR based network model is good but as they stand need more work. Specifically, one needs to understand the joint interaction of network and transmission probability p."/>
