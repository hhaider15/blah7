  <chunk id="26300f1df41b1308ba14cd9d83f7729a52283e7f.c1" text="Cyclodextrins, since their discovery in the late 19th century, were mainly regarded as excipients. Nevertheless, developments in cyclodextrin research have shown that some of these hosts can capture and include biomolecules, highlighting fatty acids and cholesterol, which implies that they are not inert and that their action may be used in specific medicinal purposes. The present review, centered on literature reports from the year 2000 until the present day, presents a comprehensive description of the known biological activities of cyclodextrins and their implications for medicinal applications. The paper is divided into two main sections, one devoted to the properties and applications of cyclodextrins as active pharmaceutical ingredients in a variety of pathologies, from infectious ailments to cardiovascular dysfunctions and metabolic diseases. The second section is dedicated to the use of cyclodextrins in a range of biomedical technologies."/>
