Comparison of RSV and influenza infection in hospitalized older adults may increase awareness of adult RSV disease burden."/>
  <chunk id="4261cfd373572b30e170171afce095e6eb5d806a.c2" text="Methods. Hospitalized adults aged ≥60 years who tested positive for RSV or influenza between 1 January 2011 and 30 June 2015 were identified from Kaiser Permanente Southern California electronic medical records. Baseline characteristics, comorbidities, utilization, and outcomes were compared."/>

Patients with RSV were older than those with influenza (mean, 78.5 vs 77.4 years; P = .035) and more likely to have congestive heart failure (35.3% vs 24.5%; P &lt; .001) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (29.8% vs 24.3%; P = .006) at baseline. In adjusted analyses, RSV infection was associated with greater odds of length of stay ≥7 days (odds ratio [OR] = 1.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-1.8; P &lt; .001); pneumonia (OR = 2.7; 95% CI, 2.2-3.2; P &lt; .001); intensive care unit admission (OR = 1.3; 95% CI, 1.0-1.7; P = .023); exacerbation of COPD (OR = 1.7; 95% CI, 1.3-2.4; P = .001); and greater mortality within 1 year of admission (OR = 1.3; 95% CI, 1.0-1.6; P = .019).">
