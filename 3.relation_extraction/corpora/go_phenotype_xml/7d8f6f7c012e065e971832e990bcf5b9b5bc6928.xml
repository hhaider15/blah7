Although this enzyme constitutes a plausible target in treatment of advanced cancer, there are few known LDH-A inhibitors."/>

Forty-six additional herbs contained significant LDH-A inhibitory properties with IC 50 s [&lt;0.07 mg/ml], some of which have common names of Arjun, Pipsissewa, Cinnamon, Pink Rose Buds/Petals, Wintergreen, Cat's Claw, Witch Hazel Root and Rhodiola Root."/>

Future research will be required to isolate chemical constituents within these plants responsible for LDH-A inhibition and investigate potential therapeutic application."/>
