  <chunk id="8a2ca0a9b9108a56a79d6a610c6537102c124697.c1" text="Homonucleoside analogues cis-16 and trans-17 having a (5-methoxycarbonyl)isoxazolidine framework were synthesized via the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of nucleobase-derived nitrones with methyl acrylate. Hydrogenolysis of the isoxazolidines containing thymine, dihydrouracil, theophylline and adenine moieties efficiently led to the formation of the respective γ-lactam analogues. γ-Lactam analogues having 5-bromouracil and 5-chlorouracil fragments were synthesized by treatment of uracil-containing γ-lactams with NBS and NCS. Isoxazolidine and γ-lactam analogues of homonucleosides obtained herein were evaluated for activity against a broad range of DNA and RNA viruses. None of the compounds that were tested exhibited antiviral or cytotoxic activity at concentrations up to 100 µM. The cytostatic activities of all compounds toward nine cancerous cell lines was tested. γ-Lactams trans-15e (Cl-Ura) and cis-15h (Theo) appeared the most active toward pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells (Capan-1), showing IC 50 values 21.5 and 18.2 µM, respectively. Isoxazolidine cis-15e (Cl-Ura) inhibited the proliferation of colorectal carcinoma (HCT-116).">
