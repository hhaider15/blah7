After a preliminary Phase I, open-label study (n = 25) to assess safety 1-14 days postvaccination, a comparative observer-blind, randomised, controlled clinical trial (n = 600) was performed to assess safety and immunogenicity versus a non-adjuvanted subunit influenza vaccine (Subunit; Agrippal ® , Novartis Vaccines). Subjects were randomised (2:1) to receive Sub/MF59™ or Subunit."/>
  <chunk id="4e951550757b4a9f7b9b5167c9774a1113c787e9.c2" text="Results: Both vaccines were well tolerated, with no vaccine-related serious adverse events reported during the Phase I trial. During the observer-blind study, local and systemic reactions were generally similar for both vaccines 1-22 days post-vaccination; however, injection-site induration was more frequent among the Subunit group (P &lt; 0.05), and mild pain at the injection site and fever were more frequent among Sub/MF59™ recipients (P ≤ 0.005). Both vaccines induced a significant (P &lt; 0.001) increase in geometric mean titres (GMTs) for the three strains tested, versus baseline; GMTs against A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and B were significantly higher in the Sub/ MF59™ group (P = 0.034, P &lt; 0.001 and P = 0.005, respectively). GMT ratios against A/H1N1, A/ H3N2 and B were also significantly higher in the Sub/MF59™ group (P = 0.038, P &lt; 0.001 and P = 0.006, respectively). Similarly, the percentage of subjects achieving seroprotection or seroconversion on Day 22 was greater for Sub/MF59™ recipients, reaching significance for A/ H3N2 (P &lt; 0.001).">
