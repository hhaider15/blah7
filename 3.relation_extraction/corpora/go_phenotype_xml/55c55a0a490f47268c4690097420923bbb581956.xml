  <chunk id="55c55a0a490f47268c4690097420923bbb581956.c1" text="Lassa virus (LASV) is the causative agent of Lassa fever, a human hemorrhagic disease associated with high mortality and morbidity rates, particularly prevalent in West Africa. Over the past few years, a significant amount of novel information has been provided on cellular factors that are determinant elements playing a role in arenavirus multiplication. In this review, we focus on host proteins that intersect with the initial steps of the LASV replication cycle: virus entry and genome replication. A better understanding of relevant virus-host interactions essential for sustaining these critical steps may help to identify possible targets for the rational design of novel therapeutic approaches against LASV and other arenaviruses that cause severe human disease.">

NP associates tightly with the viral genomic and antigenomic RNAs forming ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes called nucleocapsids. Nucleocapsids bind the L polymerase, constituting the biologically active units for transcription of subgenomic viral mRNAs and for viral genome replication [11] [12] [13] . In addition, NP interacts with the Z matrix protein and contributes to the packaging of RNPs into viral particles during virion morphogenesis [14] [15] [16] . Crystallographic studies revealed that LASV NP is organized in two distinct domains [17] . The N-terminal domain contains a basic crevice, initially proposed to be an m7GTP cap binding site and later reported to function in binding RNA [17, 18] . The C-terminal domain of NP harbors a functional 3 -5 exoribonuclease activity of the DExD/H-box protein family that has been shown to oppose the host type I interferon (IFN-I)-mediated immune response during viral infection. In this regard, NP is capable of degrading small viral doubled-stranded RNA fragments that could function as pathogen-associated molecular patterns, to prevent their recognition by cellular pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) [17, [19] [20] [21] . In addition, the role of NP in the negative regulation of IFN-I production has been linked to its ability to prevent the nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB), and its direct association with the retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and I-kappa-B kinase epsilon (IKKε), thereby inhibiting the activation and nuclear translocation of the interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) [22] [23] [24] .">

DG is expressed as a precursor and proteolytically cleaved to generate the mature α and β subunits that together serve as a molecular bridge between the extracellular matrix and the cytoplasm [32] [33] [34] [35] . α-DG is found in the extracellular compartment, where it binds components such as laminin, and requires O-glycosylation to perform its biological functions [36, 37] , whereas the transmembrane β subunit (β-DG) docks to the cytoskeleton by associating to the cytoplasmic adaptor proteins dystrophin and utrophin [35, 38, 39] . DG is expressed in most cell types, but its expression patterns and glycosylation levels differ depending on the tissue [34, 35] .">
