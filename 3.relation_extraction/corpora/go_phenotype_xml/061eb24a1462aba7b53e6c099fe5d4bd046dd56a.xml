  <chunk id="061eb24a1462aba7b53e6c099fe5d4bd046dd56a.c1" text="Guanine (G)-quadruplexes (G4s) are unique nucleic acid structures that are formed by stacked G-tetrads in G-rich DNA or RNA sequences. G4s have been reported to play significant roles in various cellular events in both macro-and micro-organisms. The identification and characterization of G4s can help to understand their different biological roles and potential applications in diagnosis and therapy. In addition to biophysical and biochemical methods to interrogate G4 formation, G4 fluorescent turn-on ligands can be used to target and visualize G4 formation both in vitro and in cells. Here, we review several representative classes of G4 fluorescent turn-on ligands in terms of their interaction mechanism and application perspectives. Interestingly, G4 structures are commonly identified in DNA and RNA aptamers against targets that include proteins and small molecules, which can be utilized as G4 tools for diverse applications. We therefore also summarize the recent development of G4-containing aptamers and highlight their applications in biosensing, bioimaging, and therapy. Moreover, we discuss the current challenges and future perspectives of G4 fluorescent turn-on ligands and G4-containing aptamers."/>

Recent studies have also suggested that G4 structures can serve as promising cancer and anti-microbe targets [18, 19] . To identify such potential G4 targets, various computational methods such as QGRS Mapper [20], quadparser [3], G4 Hunter [21], G4NN [22], and Quadron [23] have been developed to predict G4 formations. Spectroscopic techniques such as circular dichroism (CD) [24], UV melting [25], mass spectrometry [26], nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) [27], and intrinsic fluorescence [28] can also detect G4 formation based on its physical properties in a label-free manner. In addition to these biophysical methods, biochemical methods such as polymerase stop assay [29] and dimethyl sulfate (DMS) footprinting [30] can interrogate DNA G4 formation by template extension stalling and measuring the guanine nucleotide's resistance to the attachment of a chemical probe, respectively. More recently, in vitro methods that utilize rG4-mediated reverse transcriptase stalling have been developed to interrogate rG4 in low-abundance transcripts [31], and selective 2 -hydroxyl acylation analyzed by a lithium ion-mediated primer extension (SHALiPE), and DMSLiPE [32] have been developed to map distinctive structural patterns of rG4. Several next-generation sequencing-based approaches such as G4-seq [33], G4-Chip [34], rG4-seq [35], DMS-seq [36], and G4RP [37] enable the genome-wide and transcriptome-wide profiling of G4s.">

These fluorescent turn-on ligands can be used to track G4 formation both in vitro and in cells, and they are discussed in detail in this review."/>
  <chunk id="061eb24a1462aba7b53e6c099fe5d4bd046dd56a.c4" text="Besides acting as potential targets, G4s can be used as molecular tools for diverse applications. It is worth noting that the structure of G4s has been identified in studies using combinatorial methods and the systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) technique with the aim of developing aptamers for therapeutic and diagnostic purposes [38] [39] [40] . G4s provide extra chemical and thermal stability for aptamer-based therapeutics, and such aptamers have been successfully designed to target a number of HIV proteins [41, 42] , prion proteins [43] , and anti-cancer targets [44, 45] . In diagnostics, G4-containing aptamers have been widely applied to target a wide range of pathogenic proteins and small molecules to emit a fluorescence-like signal [40] . In this review, we summarize the recent development of fluorogenic G4 ligands and G4-containing aptamers, and highlight their latest applications in vitro and in cells ( Figure 1D ). We will also discuss current challenges and future perspectives for better detection and targeting of G4s in diverse organisms, as well as for designing and developing G4-related tools for various biological applications."/>

On the one hand, some of these ligands are designed as fluorescent/imaging probes to verify G4 formation. On the other hand, some ligands can stabilize G4s and serve as chemical tools to challenge and alter G4-dependent processes. Also, it is possible that some ligands can perform both functions. In this review, we mainly focus on the organic G4 probes that is fluorogenic for in vitro and in cell detection of G4. As shown in Figure 2 , these organic Molecules 2019, 24, 2416 4 of 34"/>

It should also be of note that there are also large repertoires of inorganic G4 probes that are luminogenic, and they have been extensively studied and several excellent reviews can be found elsewhere [53] [54] [55] [56] . One representative example includes iridium (III) complex based G4s sensing methods; luminescent G4 switch-on probe for highly selective and tunable detection of cysteine and glutathione based on iridium (III) complex [57] . This method showed an enhanced intensity in the presence of desired metabolites [57] . Other examples of iridium (III) complex G4s based methods have also been reported, for instance, detection method for nicking endonuclease Nb.BsmI activity [58], for prostate specific antigen detection [59] , thymine DNA glycosylase activity detection [60] , for the detection of Siglec -5 [61] and for ribonuclease H detection [62] . Platinum (II) complexes are another representative example of inorganic G4 ligand; Ma et al [63] reported the synthesis of platinum (II) complexes containing dipyridophenazine ligand as a highly sensitive luminescence probe for the detection of G4s and also showed to inhibit human telomerase enzyme (property also seen with organic ligands) and occur via an end stacking approach with a binding affinity of ∼10 7 dm 3 mol −1 [63] . Other examples of platinum (II) complexes reported includes the detection of nanomolar silver (I) ion in solution [64], as luminescence probe for G4 and c-myc downregulation [65] . Also, terpyridine ligand containing platinum (II) complexes have been shown by Sunthaaralingam et al. [66] to strongly binds to G4s of hTelo and c-myc through π-π stacking [66], which binding affinity and selectivity influenced by their aromatic surface [67] . Additionally, Ruthenium (II) complexes have been also reported as a selective luminescence probe for G4 detection, and occur via stacking of the ligand onto the G-tetrad and also based on insertion of the complex into the groove [68] . Other examples of ruthenium (II) complexes were also reported; for instance for sensing and methylation of duplex and G4s using Ruthenium (II) complexes containing dipyridylphenazine (dppz) ligand [69] for selective binding to various G4s using a bromo-substituent to the dipyridylphenazine [70] . Some advantages of inorganic fluorogenic ligands include their tunability, distinct properties (like anticancer drug development and their ability to induce G4s), and structures [66, 68, 71] .">
