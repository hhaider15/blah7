Although sustained or repeated stress can result in severe deleterious physiological effects, the causes of stress in free-ranging animals are yet poorly documented. In our study, we aimed at identifying the main factors affecting stress levels in free-ranging wolves (Canis lupus).">

We analyzed a total of 450 fecal samples from eleven wolf packs belonging to three protected populations, in Italy (Abruzzo), France (Mercantour), and the United States (Yellowstone). We collected samples during two consecutive winters in each study area. We found no relationship between FCM concentrations and age, sex or social status of individuals. At the group level, our results suggest that breeding pair permanency and the loss of pack members through processes different from dispersal may importantly impact stress levels in wolves. We measured higher FCM levels in comparatively small packs living in sympatry with a population of free-ranging dogs. Lastly, our results indicate that FCM concentrations are associated with endoparasitic infections of individuals. groups remains largely unknown in free-ranging social species. Indeed, most studies of the causes of stress in social species focused on the impact of aggressive interactions and of factors related to dominance hierarchies [29] ."/>
  <chunk id="73560247ea59c1db0dd80dc9022c7d6795f7d671.c3" text="Wolves are highly social and typically live in family-based packs consisting of a mated pair and their offspring of the past 1 to 4.5 years [44, 45] . In a stable pack, dominance relationships are typically age-graded, with the parents being naturally the top ranking (hereafter 'dominant') individuals, and the only breeding members of the pack [46] . Multiple litters within a group may however occur, particularly when one or both of the original breeders are lost, or in newly founded packs [47] [48] [49] [50] . When former breeders become no longer reproductively active before their death, they may keep taking part in all other activities of the group [46] . Mating season takes place once a year during late winter. Most males and females usually reach sexual maturity as yearlings at about 22 months of age [51, 52] . Despite all sexually mature females of a pack having a normal estrous cycle and ovulating [46, 51, 53] , wolves are essentially monogamous and the breeding partners of established packs often pair for a lifetime [46, 47] . After 61-64 days of gestation [52] , an average of 4-6 pups are born in April-May, which greatly benefit from extended alloparental care by the pack members of both sexes [44, 46] . While growing up in the pack, the offspring learn social communication, hunting and foraging strategies, and gradually take part in the rearing of pups and territorial defense [44, 46] . Most wolves disperse from their natal pack between 9 and 36 months of age [46] , alone or in groups, with little known consistent difference between males and females in dispersal characteristics [44] . Dispersers may be accepted in existing packs, in particular after the loss of a breeding partner [44, 45, 54] . Although packs appear socially less cohesive in summer compared to winter [55], the litter of pups is the social core of the group [44, 56] and the social status of dominant individuals does not change throughout the year. Pack members may repeatedly leave and return to their natal pack at any time of the year, before ultimately dispersing. Dispersal most often takes place in fall, or from mid-winter to early spring, i.e. between the mating and the denning seasons [44] .">

Whereas higher GCs levels were reported in identified [57] or suspected [59] dominant compared to subordinate free-ranging wolves, no correlation between social status and GCs was found in a captive pack [58] . No conclusive link between stress levels and within-pack agonistic encounters could be concluded from these studies, but they reported an increase of GCs during the annual mating season [57], at least in some individuals [58] . To our knowledge, social or territorial stability of packs was never investigated as a potential stressor in wolves. Since direct confrontations with neighboring packs can be severely injurious [44, 46] , stress levels might depend on the density of the population at a regional scale [31], pack size, and the overall duration of extra-territorial travels. Wolves are well adapted to winter conditions [60] , and previous investigations found no relationship between GCs levels and snow pack or minimum temperature [57] . In addition, no seasonal or circadian variation in GCs concentrations has been found in the species [53, 58] . Snowmobile activity was associated with elevated FCM levels in wolves [27] , and is the only anthropogenic stressor investigated in free-ranging populations that we are aware of.">
