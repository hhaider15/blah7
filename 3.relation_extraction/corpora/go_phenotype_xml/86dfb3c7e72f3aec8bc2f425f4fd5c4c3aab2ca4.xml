Assessment of these devices under multiple experimental conditions will provide insight for device use.">

  <chunk id="86dfb3c7e72f3aec8bc2f425f4fd5c4c3aab2ca4.c2" text="The primary objective of this study was to assess and compare bioaerosol sampling devices using a) an in vitro, environmentally-controlled artificial bioaerosol system at a range of different RH conditions and b) an in vivo bioaerosol system of influenza virus-infected ferrets under controlled environmental conditions. Secondarily, we also sought to examine the impact of NSAIDs on bioaerosol emission in influenza virus-infected ferrets to address its potential as a determinant of bioaerosol emission."/>

The following samplers were tested: the polytetrafluoroethylene filter (PTFE filter), the 2stage National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health cyclone sampler (NIOSH cyclone sampler) and the 6-stage viable Andersen impactor (Andersen impactor).">

Using the ferret model, the PTFE filter, NIOSH cyclone sampler and the Andersen impactor collected up to 3.66 log 10 copies of RNA/L air, 3.84 log 10 copies of RNA/L air and 6.09 log 10 copies of RNA/L air respectively at peak recovery. Infectious virus was recovered from the PTFE filter and NIOSH cyclone samplers on the peak day of viral RNA recovery."/>
