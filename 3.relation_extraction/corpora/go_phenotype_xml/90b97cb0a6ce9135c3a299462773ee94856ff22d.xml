A total of 947 bats were investigated originating from 52 capture sites (22 caves, 18 buildings, and 12 outdoor sites) distributed over different bioclimatic zones of the island. Using RT-PCR targeting the L-polymerase gene of the Paramyxoviridae family, we found that 10.5% of sampled bats were infected, representing six out of seven families and 15 out of 31 species analyzed. Univariate analysis indicates that both abiotic and biotic factors may promote viral infection. Using generalized linear modeling of UMRV infection overlaid on biotic and abiotic variables, we demonstrate that sympatric occurrence of bats is a major factor for virus transmission. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that all paramyxoviruses infecting Malagasy bats are UMRVs and showed little host specificity. Analyses using the maximum parsimony reconciliation tool CoRe-PA, indicate that hostswitching, rather than co-speciation, is the dominant macro-evolutionary mechanism of UMRVs among Malagasy bats.">

Co-speciation and host-switching are the two main evolutionary mechanisms generating genetic diversity among micro-organisms. Both are long-term dynamic processes 3 , in contrast to co-evolution sensu stricto, which continuously acts on a short-time scale 4 . Co-speciation, the simultaneous speciation of the host and their parasites 3,5-7 , was considered for many years as the principal macro-evolutionary process generating viral diversity [8] [9] [10] [11] . As convincing examples of co-speciation are rare, this mechanism has probably been overestimated. Host-switching refers to a new host-parasite combination that results from the shift of the parasite to a new host and its subsequent specialization, for example, under environmental selection pressure 12 . Colonization by a parasite of a phylogenetically closely related host species, often of the same genus or family, has proven to be the typical macro-evolutionary mechanism for RNA viruses 13 . An excellent example is the evolutionary history of Hantavirus and Arenavirus 14,15 , mostly shaped by multiple host-jumps, followed by adaptive processes within the new host, as demonstrated in bats and other operative host species 16, 17 ."/>

Deciphering such mechanisms helps to understand how a virus hosted in wild animals can emerge as a pathogen in human populations 19 . For example, host-switching of Ebola virus, SARS Coronavirus or Nipah virus have led to major pandemics or epidemics in humans 2,20,21 .">

Newly recognized paramyxoviruses (PVs), named Unclassified Morbilli-Related Viruses (UMRVs), have recently been shown to infect small mammals around the world 23 , such as bats and terrestrial small mammals from the southwestern Indian Ocean (SWIO) islands 17,24 , including the biodiversity hotspot of Madagascar 25 . The island is divided into several unique bioclimatic zones, characterized by different meteorological regimes overlaid on elevation and underlying geology 26 , which in turn give rise to distinct vegetation types and highly endemic biotic communities."/>

Genetic and fossil studies have estimated the basal split of placental mammals in the superorder Laurasiatheria from their ancestors at approximately 80-90 million years ago (Mya) and a diversification of bat families at approximately 62 Mya 28 . The Chiroptera of Madagascar are placed in eight different families and currently 45 species recognized, of which 36 species (80%) are endemic 29-31 ; it is assumed that most originated from Africa. In certain cases, phylogenetic analyses provide evidence for recent periods of diversification. For example, Malagasy Miniopterus, a notably speciose genus, colonized the island from an African source population approximately between 4.5 and 2.5 Mya, followed by a second phase between 2.5 and 1 Mya 32 ."/>
  <chunk id="90b97cb0a6ce9135c3a299462773ee94856ff22d.c6" text="An important characteristic of Malagasy bat communities is that species co-occupy day roost sites in caves, buildings or tree cavities (often in forests) in different species combinations and varying numbers. Furthermore, certain bat species may have indirect contact with other wild, introduced or domestic animals, including synanthropic small mammals, which may imply contamination of shared common water sources or fruits by bat urine/saliva 29 . Considering the notable species diversity and high levels of endemism of Malagasy bats, as well as varying community structure and ecological conditions in which they occur, Madagascar provides an excellent context to study virus transmission in these animals. Herein, we examine the factors involved in interspecific transmission of UMRVs and try to unravel the macro-evolutionary mechanisms underlying genetic diversification in these viruses."/>
