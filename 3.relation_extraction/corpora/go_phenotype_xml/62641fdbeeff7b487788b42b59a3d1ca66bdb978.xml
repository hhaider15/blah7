  <chunk id="62641fdbeeff7b487788b42b59a3d1ca66bdb978.c1" text="The Ebola crisis occurred in West-Africa highlights the urgency for its clinical treatments. Currently, no Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved therapeutics are available. Several FDA-approved drugs, including selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), possess selective anti-Ebola activities. However, the inhibitory mechanisms of these drugs remain elusive. By analyzing the structures of SERMs and their incidental biological activity (cholesterol accumulation), we hypothesized that this incidental biological activity induced by SERMs could be a plausible mechanism as to their inhibitory effects on Ebola infection. Herein, we demonstrated that the same dosages of SERMs which induced cholesterol accumulation also inhibited Ebola infection. SERMs reduced the cellular sphingosine and subsequently caused endolysosomal calcium accumulation, which in turn led to blocking the Ebola entry. Our study clarified the specific anti-Ebola mechanism of SERMs, even the cationic amphiphilic drugs (CADs), this mechanism led to the endolysosomal calcium as a critical target for development of anti-Ebola drugs."/>

Entry of Ebola virus into the cells, which is mainly mediated by its sole glycoprotein (GP), is a target for therapeutic intervention 3-7 . Ebola entry is unusual in that it requires proteolytic-priming of GP followed by engagement of Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) 8-11 , Recently, it has been proven that the Ebola virus enters cells through the endolysosome that contain both NPC1 and the two-pore segment channel 2 (TPC2) 12 .">

Unfortunately, there are still no FDA-approved vaccines or anti-Ebola therapeutics 1,14 . Considering the time-consuming process of developing new drugs, it is more cost-and time-effective to screen for effective anti-Ebola drugs from among the drugs that are already FDA-approved. Some groups have identified 80 FDA-approved drugs with selective anti-Ebola activity, including the SERMs 3,4,6,7 . Many of these identified drugs selectively inhibit the infection of Ebola virus and do not inhibit vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) or the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. While the mechanism of inhibition is unknown, it is clear that these drugs do not inhibit the internalization of Ebola virus to the lysosomal associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1)-positive lysosome, the acidification of the endolysosome, or the processing of Ebola GP cathepsin 3,4,6 . Moreover, the inhibition of Ebola entry by SERMs is independent of expression of the estrogen receptors, making the mechanism by which SERMs inhibit Ebola infection difficult to ascertain 15 .">

Compared to the ethyl chlorine of toremifene, the corresponding groups in tamoxifen, clomiphene and raloxifene make weaker (even no) interations with the binding sites in Ebola GP 16 (Supplementary Fig. S1 ). However, tamoxifen, clomiphene and raloxifene all can effectively inhibit the Ebola infection 3,4,6,7 , making the interaction with Ebola GP not the key mechanism in Ebola inhibition by these SERMs. These uncertain mechanisms need further studies.">

Much of the incidental biological activities of the CADs are related to their structural properties; several CADs are weak bases which are protonated after entering the low pH of the endolysosome. The ionized form of the CADs cannot pass through the hydrophobic core of the phospholipid bilayer that surrounds the endolysosome compartment, and are, therefore, trapped and concentrated inside 17 . The concentrated CADs in the endolysosome could disturb phospholipid metabolism, the transport of lipids and proteins, and the activity of enzymes in the endolysosome.">

In this study, we explored the relationships between Ebola infection inhibition and the adverse effect of SERMs. Using an LC-MS/MS assay and imaging of endolysosomal calcium release, we demonstrated that SERMs could reduce the cellular sphingosine levels and subsequently induce accumulation of endolysosomal calcium. Moreover, chelating luminal endocytic calcium with high-affinity Rhod-dextran induced the specific inhibition of Ebola infection without inhibiting the internalization of Ebola virus-like particle (VLP) to the TPC2+ endolysosome. These data support our hypothesis that SERMs (and potentially other CADs) induce sphingosine defects and subsequent endolysosomal calcium accumulation, which in turn inhibit the release of Ebola from the TPC2+ endolysosome.">
