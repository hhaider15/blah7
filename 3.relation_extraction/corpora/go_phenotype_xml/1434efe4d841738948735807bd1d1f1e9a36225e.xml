The participants responded to a baseline web questionnaire addressing existing medical conditions, medication, previous seasonal flu vaccination, physical contact with other people, travelling patterns, physical activity and the intake of supplements. The study participants reported via a web questionnaire (flu event questionnaire) their flu-like symptoms (fever, headache, tiredness, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, body aches, diarrhoea, vomiting) during the 2009/2010 flu season, and responded to a follow-up web questionnaire (including pandemic flu vaccination status) in spring 2010. Serum and heparin blood samples were drawn at study entry and after the flu season in spring 2010. Prepaid envelopes and nasal swabs were also provided to the participants at study entry and they were invited to use them at the onset of ILI symptoms and send them back for analysis as described below. If the participant's swab was identified with any influenza RNA or corona virus DNA, a home visit (the mean time between the first swab and the home visit was 2,5 weeks) was performed to sample one nasal swab and a blood sample from the index study participant as well as from the household members after they agreed on an informed consent. The study was approved by the regional ethics review board (DN 2009(DN /1183 and each individual study participant provided informed consent.">
