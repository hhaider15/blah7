  <chunk id="667001630cb051990f577e069785590fce4b4d14.c1" text="The marine-derived fungus Stachylidium sp. was isolated from the sponge Callyspongia sp. cf. C. flammea. Culture on a biomalt medium supplemented with sea salt led to the isolation of three new phthalide derivatives, i.e., marilones A-C (1-3), and the known compound silvaticol (4). The skeleton of marilones A and B is most unusual, and its biosynthesis is suggested to require unique biochemical reactions considering fungal secondary metabolism. Marilone A (1) was found to have antiplasmodial activity against Plasmodium berghei liver stages with an IC 50 of 12.1 µM. Marilone B (2) showed selective antagonistic activity towards the serotonin receptor 5-HT 2B with a K i value of 7.7 µM.">
