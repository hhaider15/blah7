Previous studies have reported that infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) infection can produce cytopathic effects (CPE) and apoptosis in some mammalian cells and primary cells. However, there is little research on IBV-induced immune cell apoptosis. In this study, chicken macrophage HD11 cells were established as a cellular model that is permissive to IBV infection. Then, IBV-induced apoptosis was observed through a cell viability assay, morphological changes, and flow cytometry. The activity of caspases, the inhibitory efficacy of caspase-inhibitors and the expression of apoptotic genes further suggested the activation of apoptosis through both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways in IBV-infected HD11 cells. Additionally, ammonium chloride (NH 4 Cl) pretreated HD11 cells blocked IBV from entering cells and inhibited IBV-induced apoptosis. UV-inactivated IBV also lost the ability of apoptosis induction. IBV replication was increased by blocking caspase activation. This study presents a chicken macrophage cell line that will enable further analysis of IBV infection and offers novel insights into the mechanisms of IBV-induced apoptosis in immune cells.">
