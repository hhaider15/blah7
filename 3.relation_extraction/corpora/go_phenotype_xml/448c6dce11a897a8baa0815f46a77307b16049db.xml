  <chunk id="448c6dce11a897a8baa0815f46a77307b16049db.c1" text="Background: The analysis of oligonucleotide microarray data in pathogen surveillance and discovery is a challenging task. Target template concentration, nucleic acid integrity, and host nucleic acid composition can each have a profound effect on signal distribution. Exploratory analysis of fluorescent signal distribution in clinical samples has revealed deviations from normality, suggesting that distribution-free approaches should be applied.">

Of the three tests, the chi-square proved most useful."/>

We report that our implementation of the chi-square test yielded a combination of low false positive rates and a high degree of predictive accuracy."/>
