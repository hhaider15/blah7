  <chunk id="e57993034cb1196b96daff4505db38640782f4a0.c1" text="Background: CMV-specific T-cells are crucial to control CMV-replication post-transplant. Regulatory T-cells (T-regs) are associated with a tolerant immune state and may contribute to CMV-replication. However, T-cell subsets such as T-regs and IL-17 producing T-cells (Th-17) are not well studied in this context. We explored T-regs and Th-17 frequencies during CMVreplication after transplantation."/>
  <chunk id="e57993034cb1196b96daff4505db38640782f4a0.c2" text="Methods: We prospectively evaluated 30 transplant patients with CMV-viremia. We quantified CMV-specific CD4 + and CD8 + T-cells, T-regs (CD4 + CD25 + FoxP3 + ) and Th-17 frequencies using flow-cytometry and followed patients requiring anti-viral treatment. Two subsets were compared: anti-viral treatment requirement (n = 20) vs. spontaneous clearance of viremia (n = 10).">

Using a ratio of CMV-specific CD4 + T-cells to T-regs allowed prediction of viral clearance with 80% sensitivity and 90% specificity (p = 0.001). One month after stop of treatment, the same correlation was observed in patients protected from CMV-relapse. The ratio of CMV-specific CD4 + T-cells to T-regs allowed prediction of relapse with 85% sensitivity and 86% specificity (p = 0.004). Th-17 responses were not correlated with virologic outcomes."/>

These preliminary data suggest that measurement of CMV-specific CD4 + T-cells together with T-regs has value in predicting spontaneous clearance of viremia and relapse.">
