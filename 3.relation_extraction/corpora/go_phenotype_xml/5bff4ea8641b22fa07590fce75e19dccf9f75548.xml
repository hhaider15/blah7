Blood samples were collected from jugular vein in tubes with anticoagulant agent to evaluate the concentration of triglycerides, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), ALP, total and direct bilirubin. Very low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (VLDL-C) and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels were calculated according to the Friedewald formula.">
