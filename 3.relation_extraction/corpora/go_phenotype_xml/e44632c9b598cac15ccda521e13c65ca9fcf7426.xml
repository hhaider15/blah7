However, sampling of the airways poses a significant challenge, particularly in infants and children. Here, we report a reliable method for obtaining nasal epithelial cell RNA from infants for genome-wide transcriptomic analysis, and describe baseline expression characteristics in an asymptomatic cohort. Nasal epithelial cells were collected by brushing of the inferior turbinates, and gene expression was interrogated by RNA-seq analysis. Reliable recovery of RNA occurred in the absence of adverse events. We observed high expression of epithelial cell markers and similarity to the transcriptome for intrapulmonary airway epithelial cells. We identified genes displaying low and high expression variability, both inherently, and in response to environmental exposures. The greatest gene expression differences in this asymptomatic cohort were associated with the presence of known pathogenic viruses and/or bacteria. Robust bacteria-associated gene expression patterns were significantly associated with the presence of Moraxella. In summary, we have developed a reliable method for interrogating the infant airway transcriptome by sampling the nasal epithelium. Our data demonstrates both the fidelity and feasibility of our methodology, and describes normal gene expression and variation within a healthy infant cohort.">

As compared to the tremendous progress made over the last decades in our understanding of adult lung diseases such as COPD and lung fibrosis 1-3 , this limitation has restricted progress in identifying the molecular mechanisms contributing to pediatric respiratory diseases. Many contemporary studies sample the upper airway, using aspirates of tracheal secretions in intubated subjects to collect intra-airway inflammatory cells and sloughed resident cells of the airway. The availability of these samples is limited to intubated subjects, introducing significant selection bias. Furthermore, the ability of these samples to reliably capture the cellular and molecular state of the lung is unclear. Other studies have analyzed nasal washings, which can be performed in a more broad population. Again, these samples are of unclear relevance to the pathophysiology of the lung.">

We present a reliable procedure for sampling resident cells of the airway in healthy young infants, which is applicable to infants experiencing respiratory infectious disease (T. Mariani, unpublished observations), and likely to older ill and healthy pediatric subjects. Furthermore, we provide a benchmark healthy infant nasal transcriptome (HINT) data set, describing baseline expression and natural variation, for asymptomatic subjects. Our data demonstrates that it is technically feasible to quantify genome-wide RNA expression from young infant's airways, which may be helpful in the evaluation of host responses to diseased states.">

As shown in Fig. 2 , the samples generated an average of 27 ± 6 million total reads, with 66 ± 14% displaying unique mapping to the human genome.
