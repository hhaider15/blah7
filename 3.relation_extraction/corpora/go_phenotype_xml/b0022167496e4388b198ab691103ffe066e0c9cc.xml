  <chunk id="b0022167496e4388b198ab691103ffe066e0c9cc.c1" text="The complete genome sequence of a reassortant field strain of bluetongue virus serotype 16 (BTV-16), isolated from cattle in the Apulia region of Italy in 2002, has been determined by Illumina sequencing. Sequence comparisons of segment 1 (Seg-1) to Seg-10, except Seg-5, show that BTV-16 strain ITL2002 belongs to the major eastern topotype of BTV."/>
