Three of 40 active participants discontinued zanamivir due to side effects; the remaining 37 took &gt;85% of scheduled doses for a median of 121 days. Symptomatic, laboratory-confirmed influenza was detected in one person randomized to zanamivir (2Á5%) and 2/ 20 (10%) who received the vaccine (P = 0Á25). Forty-seven participants reported 109 episodes of ARI. Factors associated with an ARI were exposure to a spouse (OR 7Á2), child (OR 2Á4) or patient (OR 2Á0) with symptoms of an ARI in the previous 7 days.">

Most adults were willing and able to comply with season-long prophylaxis. Report of recent exposure to family members and patients with an ARI increased the risk of developing an ARI in healthy adults.">
