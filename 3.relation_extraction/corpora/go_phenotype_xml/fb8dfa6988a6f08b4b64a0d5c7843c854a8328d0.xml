  <chunk id="fb8dfa6988a6f08b4b64a0d5c7843c854a8328d0.c1" text="Hepatitis C virus p7 protein is a 63 amino acid polytopic protein with two transmembrane domains (TMDs) and one of the prime targets for anti HCV drug development. A bio-inspired modeling pathway is used to generate plausible computational models of the two TMDs forming the monomeric protein model. A flexible region between Leu-13 and Gly-15 is identified for TMD1 1-32 and a region around Gly-46 to Trp-48 for TMD2 36-58 . Mutations of the tyrosine residues in TMD2 36-58 into phenylalanine and serine are simulated to identify their role in shaping TMD2. Lowest energy structures of the two TMDs connected with the loop residues are used for a posing study in which small molecule drugs BIT225, amantadine, rimantadine and NN-DNJ, are identified to bind to the loop region. BIT225 is identified to interact with the backbone of the functionally important residues Arg-35 and Trp-36.">
