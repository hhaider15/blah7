Built on the concept of 'the' HPS framework, the Hong Kong Healthy Schools Award scheme includes &quot;Personal Health Skills&quot; as one of its key aspects to improve student hygiene knowledge and practices. This study examines the differences in student perceptions, knowledge and health behaviours between those schools that have adopted the HPS framework and those that have not adopted.">

For HSA group, 5 primary schools and 7 secondary schools entered the study with 510 students and 789 students sampled respectively. For the 'Non-HPS' group, 8 primary schools and 7 secondary schools entered the study with 676 students and 725 students sampled respectively.

Although a causal relationship is yet to be established, the HPS appears to be a viable approach for addressing communicable diseases.">
