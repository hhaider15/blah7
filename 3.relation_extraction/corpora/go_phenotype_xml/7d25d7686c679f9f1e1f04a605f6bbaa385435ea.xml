CoV helicase is one of the three evolutionary most conserved proteins in nidoviruses, thus making it an important target for drug development. We report here the first structure of fulllength coronavirus helicase, MERS-CoV nsp13. MERS-CoV helicase has multiple domains, including an N-terminal Cys/His rich domain (CH) with three zinc atoms, a beta-barrel domain and a C-terminal SF1 helicase core with two RecA-like subdomains. Our structural analyses show that while the domain organization of nsp13 is conserved throughout nidoviruses, the individual domains of nsp13 are closely related to the equivalent eukaryotic domains of Upf1 helicases. The most distinctive feature differentiating CoV helicases from eukaryotic Upf1 helicases is the interaction between CH domain and helicase core."/>

Outbreak of MERS-CoV in the Republic of Korea in 2015 highlighted that the newly emerged CoVs remain a concern for the public health. Nevertheless, effective vaccine and drug against CoVs are still missing. Among CoV-encoded nonstructural proteins (nsps), nsp13 helicase is considered one of the most important drug targets. Nsp13 is a highly conserved protein in CoVs and nidovirales and one of the two central components of the membrane associated replication-transcription complex, which performs viral RNA synthesis. However, despite decades of structural characterization of CoV-encoded proteins, the structure of nsp13 remained unavailable. In this study, we determined the first crystal structure of the full-length MERS-CoV nsp13. MERS-CoV helicase has an N-terminal Cys/His rich domain (CH) with three zincs, a beta-barrel domain and a C-terminal SF1 helicase core. While the domain organization of nsp13 is similar to arterivirus nsp10, the individual domains of nsp13 are closely related to their PLOS Pathogens | https://doi.">
