All staff and patients in the involved neurosurgical department were surveyed for any symptoms of fever (≥38°C) and enlarged tonsils during the outbreak period. Throat swabs and demographic information were collected for all cases. For each specimen, assays for common respiratory viruses were performed using one-step reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. HAdV-positive samples were inoculated onto Hep-2 cells for isolation. Hexon genes, fiber genes, penton genes, and whole genomes were sequenced. A phylogenetic tree was constructed.">

Nurses had the highest attack rate of infection, with a rate of 36.4%. The attack rate for doctors and inpatients was 20.0% and 16.7%, respectively. HAdV55 was the sole pathogen identified during this outbreak. The hexon, fiber, and penton genes from seven isolated HAdV55 stains were sequenced."/>

While not conclusive, the epidemic investigation revealed that the outbreak was introduced by nurses from sources outside the hospital. It was likely that a transmission from staff to inpatients had occurred."/>
