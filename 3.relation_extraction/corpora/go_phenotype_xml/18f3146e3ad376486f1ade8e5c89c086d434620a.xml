  <chunk id="18f3146e3ad376486f1ade8e5c89c086d434620a.c1" text="The universal second messenger cAMP regulates diverse intracellular processes by interacting with ubiquitously expressed proteins, such as Protein Kinase A (PKA) and the Exchange Protein directly Activated by cAMP (EPAC). EPAC is implicated in multiple pathologies, thus several EPAC-specific inhibitors have been identified in recent years. However, the mechanisms and molecular interactions underlying the EPAC inhibition elicited by such compounds are still poorly understood. Additionally, being hydrophobic low molecular weight species, EPAC-specific inhibitors are prone to forming colloidal aggregates, which result in non-specific aggregation-based inhibition (ABI) in aqueous systems. Here, we review from a biophysical perspective the molecular basis of the specific and non-specific interactions of two EPAC antagonists-CE3F4R, a non-competitive inhibitor, and ESI-09, a competitive inhibitor of EPAC. Additionally, we discuss the value of common ABI attenuators (e.g., TX and HSA) to reduce false positives at the expense of introducing false negatives when screening aggregation-prone compounds. We hope this review provides the EPAC community effective criteria to evaluate similar compounds, aiding in the optimization of existing drug leads, and informing the development of the next generation of EPAC-specific inhibitors.">

Importantly, in 1998, a new cAMP receptor was discovered after observing cAMP-dependent activation for the small GTPase Rap1, which was independent of PKA [16] . The new cAMP receptor, now known as the exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (EPAC), was then identified through a database screen for putative cAMP-binding domains [16] . There are two isoforms of EPAC (EPAC1 and EPAC2) that serve as guanine exchange factors for Ras-like GTPases, primarily Rap1 and Rap2 [16, 17] . EPAC1 is more broadly expressed, e.g., in the circulatory, excretory, reproductive and digestive systems, whereas EPAC2 is more abundant in the central nervous system (CNS), pancreas and adrenal gland [16, 17] .">
