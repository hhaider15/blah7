Although the majority of MERS-CoV cases have been reported in Saudi Arabia, the overall risk in areas outside the Middle East remains significant as inside Saudi Arabia. Additional pandemics of MERS-CoV are expected, and thus novel tools and reagents for therapy and diagnosis are urgently needed. Here, we used phage display to develop novel monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that target MERS-CoV. A human Fab phage display library was panned against the S2 subunit of the MERS-CoV spike protein (MERS-S2P), yielding three unique Fabs (S2A3, S2A6, and S2D5). The Fabs had moderate apparent affinities (Half maximal effective concentration (EC 50 = 123-421 nM) for MERS-S2P, showed no cross-reactivity to spike proteins from other CoVs, and were non-aggregating and thermostable (T m = 61.5-80.4 â€¢ C). Reformatting the Fabs into IgGs (Immunoglobulin Gs) greatly increased their apparent affinities (K D = 0.17-1.2 nM), presumably due to the effects of avidity. These apparent affinities were notably higher than that of a previously reported anti-MERS-CoV S2 reference mAb (K D = 8.7 nM). Furthermore, two of the three mAbs (S2A3 and S2D5) bound only MERS-CoV (Erasmus Medical Center (EMC)) and not other CoVs, reflecting their high binding specificity. However, the mAbs lacked MERS-CoV neutralizing activity. Given their high affinity, specificity, and desirable stabilities, we anticipate that these anti-MERS-CoV mAbs would be suitable reagents for developing antibody-based diagnostics in laboratory or hospital settings for point-of-care testing.

MERS-CoV is an enveloped RNA virus with a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome that encodes structural proteins including the spike (S) protein and the nucleocapsid protein (NP) [4] . Like all coronaviruses, the S protein, present on the surface of the MERS-CoV virion, plays a critical role in the viral entry into host cells [5, 6] . The S protein consists of two non-covalently associated subunits, S1 and S2, and trimerizes to form a prefusion spike [7] [8] [9] . Upon entry of the virus into cells, the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S1 subunit recognizes the host cell receptors dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) or CD26 [10-12], while the S2 subunit has a role in viral fusion with host cell membranes through the interplay of two heptad repeats (HR1 and HR2) and a transmembrane domain on the S2 subunit [6, 13] .">

Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are rapidly emerging as an alternative approach complementing vaccines against viral infections [14] . Due to its critical role in the interaction with host cell receptors, tremendous efforts have been focused on the discovery of neutralizing mAbs against the RBD of the MERS-CoV S1 subunit [15] [16] [17] [18] . Strategies have included phage or yeast display library selection; immunization of animals, such as humanized mice and dromedary camels; and antibody isolation from human survivors of MERS-CoV infection. However, a drawback of the mAbs is their costly and time-consuming production in mammalian cell lines. Moreover, viruses can easily evolve to generate RBD variants with mutations that avoid immune responses [19, 20] . However, such mutations are less common in the S2 subunit, which makes it an attractive target for therapeutic purposes. Indeed, the first MERS-CoV S2 subunit (MERS-S2P)-targeting antibody, called G4, was generated using mouse immunization and was demonstrated to recognize a variable loop in the S2 connector domain and to neutralize infection by the virus [13, 21] .">

Therefore, the importance of developing reliable diagnostic tests is rapidly becoming clear to manage and control a viral spread. Indeed, various diagnostic tests have been developed since the first description of the virus. Real-time PCR (RT-PCR), accompanied with viral RNA sequencing, is the primary method used to detect viral infection, although there are obvious limitations of this test such as a long turnaround time [1, [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] . Serological tests relying on antibodies specific to viral antigens, such as the NP, can also be used by either capturing viral antigens through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunochromatographic tests (ICTs) [28] [29] [30] or by detecting anti-MERS-CoV antibodies through ELISA, indirect fluorescence antibody assay (IFA), Western blotting, and neutralization assays [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] .">
