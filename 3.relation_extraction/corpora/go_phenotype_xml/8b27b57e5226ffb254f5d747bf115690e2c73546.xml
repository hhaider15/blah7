  <chunk id="8b27b57e5226ffb254f5d747bf115690e2c73546.c1" text="The rate of change in selective pressures is one of the main factors that determines the likelihood that populations can adapt to stress conditions. Generally, the reduction in the population size that accompanies abrupt environmental changes makes it difficult to generate and select adaptive mutations. However, in systems with high genetic diversity, as happens in RNA viruses, mutations with beneficial effects under new conditions can already be present in the population, facilitating adaptation. In this work, we have propagated an RNA bacteriophage (Qβ) at temperatures higher than the optimum, following different patterns of change. We have determined the fitness values and the consensus sequences of all lineages throughout the evolutionary process in order to establish correspondences between fitness variations and adaptive pathways. Our results show that populations subjected to a sudden temperature change gain fitness and fix mutations faster than those subjected to gradual changes, differing also in the particular selected mutations. The life-history of populations prior to the environmental change has great importance in the dynamics of adaptation. The conclusion is that in the bacteriophage Qβ, the standing genetic diversity together with the rate of temperature change determine both the rapidity of adaptation and the followed evolutionary pathways."/>

The lower the rate of change, the smaller the drop in fitness the population experiences in each of the environments to which it is exposed. This means that the selective pressure under change has a low intensity at any point of the process and adaptation will occur through the selection of beneficial mutations that provide small effects on fitness [17] [18] [19] [20] . Since these mutations are relatively abundant [21] [22] [23] , there could be a diversity of accessible pathways for adaptation to gradual changes. In contrast to this, rapid environmental changes usually produce strong fitness drops that severely decrease the population size and, thus, the associated genetic diversity [24] [25] [26] [27] , making it difficult to find the scarce, large effect mutations that would make adaptation possible, unless those mutants already exist in the population, in which case the population bottleneck might help them to fix. The situation is even harsher when a particular combination of mutations is required for optimal adaptation. Due to the generally lower number of adaptive solutions to rapid changes, evolution would be more constrained under this condition than when changes take place at a slower rate [28] . Additionally, because epistatic interactions among mutations of small effect are weaker [29, 30] , it has also been suggested that gradual regimes would allow for populations to reach higher fitness values.">

  <chunk id="8b27b57e5226ffb254f5d747bf115690e2c73546.c4" text="In good agreement with the predictions of the models, in some studies the rate of population extinction was higher under more rapid environmental changes [12,31-33] due to the strong decline in population sizes and also, in some cases, because the adapted genotypes were only accessible upon a previous sequence of environments. This kind of historical contingency can occur when certain mutations that permit survival at high intensity of the selective pressure are deleterious in the absence of other mutations that can only be selected at a lower intensity of the selective pressure [12, 34] . There are also examples showing that populations evolving under gradual changes reached higher fitness values [9, 13, 25] and/or displayed more genetic diversity among replicate lineages than those evolving under more abrupt changes [9, 12] . In contrast to this, the results obtained in other studies manifested some discrepancy with the prediction of the models, showing that phenotypes obtained under rapid environmental change were fitter [31, 32, 35] or contained a greater diversity of mutations than those evolving at a slower pace [13] . Finally, other studies did not find differences either in the fitness or in the genetic diversity contained in populations that could be attributed to the rate of environmental change [14, 16, 36] . Altogether, those results suggest that the differences in evolutionary outcomes due to the rate of change in the selective pressures depend on both the biological system-with its particular mutation and replication rates, relevance of epistatic interactions, and underlying distribution of mutational effects-and on the assayed environmental condition.">

Specifically, we used as a model the bacteriophage Qβ, of the family Leviviridae, which infects Escherichia coli strains expressing the F pilus that acts as the virus receptor [37] . Bacteriophage Qβ has an RNA genome of positive polarity (such as poliovirus, foot-and-mouth disease virus, or the coronavirus causing the severe acute respiratory syndrome) of 4217 nucleotides that encodes four proteins: the A2 protein for bacterial lysis and entry, the coat protein, the A1 protein, which is present in low amounts in the capsid and expressed through incorrect reading of the stop codon of the coat protein, and the replicase that copies the RNA genome [37] . As in other RNA viruses, replication in Qβ proceeds at a high error rate [38] , giving rise to highly heterogeneous populations that adapt fast. The optimal temperature for replication of this virus is 37 • C (the host temperature).">
