  <chunk id="bcb21b0dcaf5456200446cd3e1c6ad1990253dbf.c1" text="Background: Much research in epidemiology has been focused on evaluating conventional methods of control strategies in the event of an epidemic or pandemic. Travel restrictions are often suggested as an efficient way to reduce the spread of a contagious disease that threatens public health, but few papers have studied in depth the effects of travel restrictions. In this study, we investigated what effect different levels of travel restrictions might have on the speed and geographical spread of an outbreak of a disease similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).">

We tested scenarios of travel restrictions in which travel over distances &gt;50 km and 20 km would be banned, taking into account different levels of compliance."/>

The result was found to be robust for different rates of intermunicipality transmission intensities."/>
