DI-RNAs are parasitic RNAs that are derived from and associated with the parent virus, taking advantage of viral-coded protein factors for their multiplication. Recent advances in the field of DI RNA biology has led to a greater understanding about generation and evolution of DI-RNAs as well as the mechanism of symptom attenuation."/>

The ease of their genetic manipulation has resulted in rapid discoveries on cis-acting RNA replication elements required for replication and recombination. DI-RNAs have been further exploited to discover host factors that modulate Tomato bushy stunt virus replication, as well as viral RNA recombination. This review discusses the current models on generation and evolution of DI-RNAs, the roles of viral and host factors in DI-RNA replication, and the mechanisms of disease attenuation.">

For viruses with RNA genomes, the DI molecules consist of RNA sequences derived from the parent RNA virus, whereas the origin of satellite RNAs are not known in most cases. Both classes of subviral RNA are parasitic, since they have to use proteins coded by viruses, called helper viruses, for their replication inside the host cells. This review will focus on the DI-RNAs and their intimate relationship with their parent viruses and host cells."/>
  <chunk id="72d4e41eee56e6b1e8b7b361375c2e9160a6da49.c4" text="DI-RNAs are created spontaneously during the replication of the viral genome and they multiply rapidly and eventually lead to slowing down of the parent virus' multiplication [reviewed by 1,2]. These RNAs are called &quot;defective&quot; because they have lost the capacity to code for all the necessary viral proteins for independent replication and thus are defective in the absence of the parent (also called helper) virus. Accordingly, the helper virus is required to provide the missing replication protein(s) in trans. DI-RNAs are referred as &quot;interfering&quot; because they can attenuate the symptoms caused by the helper virus [reviewed by 2,3]. However, some defective RNAs do not interfere with multiplication of their helper viruses; in those cases they are simply called D-RNAs. In some cases, DI-RNAs can enhance the symptoms caused by their parent viruses. Importantly, DI-RNAs are distinct from other parasitic RNAs, called satellite (sat)RNA and satellite viruses, which are associated with helper viruses. The primary difference being that satRNAs do not show intensive sequence similarities with their helper viruses and the sources of their nucleic acid sequences remain uncertain [reviewed by 2]. The hierarchical game of parasitism does not stop here. To make the matter more complex, DI-RNA has been discovered even for a satellite virus [4] . This satellite derived DI-RNA strongly interfered with the parental satellite pancium mosaic virus (SPMV), which is one of the two sub-viral particles associated with Panicum mosaic virus (PMV). Thus, there is a unique complexity and dynamism in viral co-infections that include satellite RNAs, satellite viruses and DI-RNAs."/>

DI-RNAs associated with plant virus infection has been mostly described from greenhouse samples or laboratory experiments [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . DI-RNAs associated with viruses in the tombusvirus genus are among the most extensively studied. Also, the first DI-RNAs associated with a plant virus identified were derived from Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) [11] . Thus, the TBSV DI-RNA will be discussed in detail as a model DI-RNA in this review."/>

The list includes two tombusviruses (TBSV and Cucumber necrosis virus, CNV), Brome mosaic virus (BMV), Turnip crinkle virus (TCV), Cucumber mosaic virus, Bovine viral diarrhea virus, and Hepatitis C virus [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . The in vitro data from the above works suggested that breaks, strong hairpin structures, or AU-rich streches in the template (donor) RNA promotes the viral replicase to switch template to the acceptor RNA and then use the nascent RNA as a &quot;primer&quot; for resumption of RNA synthesis on the acceptor RNA. Interestingly, cis-acting sequences as well as sequence complementarity between the nascent RNA and the acceptor RNA may guide the template-switching events [18] . Primer extension experiments with RNAs representing the nascent strand revealed that rather short (2-to-5 nt) sequence complementarity between the primer and the acceptor template was sometimes sufficient to promote re-initiation of the replicase [20, 21, [25] [26] [27] . Additional works revealed recombination &quot;cold-&quot; and &quot;hot-spots&quot;, i.e. regions of decreased and increased recombination, respectively, in the BMV and TBSV genomes [20, 21, 28] .">

For example, the TBSV-associated DI-72 RNA and other tombusvirus DI-RNAs are comprised of four noncontiguous RNA segments, namely Region I (derived from the 5 untranslated region [UTR]), Region II (representing portion of the p92 pol ORF), Regions III and IV (mostly derived from the 3 UTR) (Figure 1) [16, 29] . Interestingly, the junction sites among the four noncontiguous regions in the above DI-RNAs do not show long sequence similarity. Therefore, it has been suggested that the recombination events during TBSV DI-RNA formation are unlikely to be random, but guided by cis-acting replication sequences [17]."/>

The model postulates that the viral replicase switches template when it encounters the 5' end of the template, which serves as a strong stop signal for the replicase. The 5' end could be the natural end of the DI-RNA, so that recombination leads to the generation of head-to-tail DI-RNA dimers. New 5' ends could also be generated via cleavages by host endo-and exoribonucleases, leading to partial degradation of the DI-RNA as demonstrated for the TBSV DI-RNAs [30] [31] [32] [33] . These new 5' ends of the partially degraded DI-RNAs can then become recombination hotspots [32, 34] . These different types of recombination events could generate many different DI-RNA recombinants or promote the de novo formation of novel DI-RNAs. Due to the presence of large number of ribonucleases in host cells, this mechanism might be rather common for RNA viruses and DI-RNAs [35] .">
