Thirty-five patients had proven/probable aspergillosis and thirteen had chronic non-invasive aspergillosis. We compared PCR, galactomannan index and mycological analysis of BAL.">

  <chunk id="30e8d03a5cf6907154b5a3d7c7b23cdc96cf1952.c3" text="Results: For invasive aspergillosis (IA), PCR performed in BAL yielded 88.6% sensitivity and 95.5% specificity. Comparatively, galactomannan index and mycological examination yielded only 56.3 and 63.6% sensitivity and 97.6 and 94.5% specificity, respectively. Considering the 13 chronic aspergillosis cases, PCR, galactomannan index and mycological examination yielded 76.9, 15.4, and 84.6% sensitivity and 92.2, 94.9, and 93% specificity, respectively. Fungal load in BAL evaluated by PCR was able to discriminate between aspergillosis and contamination, but not between invasive and non-invasive forms. Finally, fungal load was predictive of 90-day mortality, with 23.1% mortality for patients with less than 500 copies/mL versus 68.4% for patients above that cut-off (p &lt; 0.05).">
