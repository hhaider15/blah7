At the district level, three districts were sampled from the total seven central urban districts of Shanghai by PPS (Huangpu, Xuhui, and Changning). At the subdistrict level, ten subdistricts within those three central urban districts were sampled by PPS, where the number of subdistricts needed per district was determined by proportionate stratification (four from Xuhui, three from Huangpu, and three from Changning). At the household level, 25 households per neighborhood were selected with the help of neighborhood committee cadres. The selection of households was encouraged to be broadly representative of the population of the neighborhood in terms of geographical spread.">

We assumed that intra-class correlation among individuals only existed at neighborhood level, not at subdistrict and not even at district. Comparing our complex sample with an unrestricted sample design, we accounted for clustering at neighborhood level, by multiplying the effective sample size by the design effect."/>
