  <chunk id="dca1ffcfcd6a2b7c8495e77c438d6b91d065bbf5.c1" text="Background: Continuous outbreaks of the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza A in Asia has resulted in an urgent effort to improve current diagnostics to aid containment of the virus and lower the threat of a influenza pandemic. We report here the development of a PCR-based assay that is highly specific for the H5N1 avian influenza A virus."/>
  <chunk id="dca1ffcfcd6a2b7c8495e77c438d6b91d065bbf5.c2" text="A one-step reverse-transcription PCR assay was developed to detect the H5N1 avian influenza A virus. The specificity of the assay was shown by testing sub-types of influenza A virus and other viral and bacterial pathogens; and on field samples."/>
  <chunk id="dca1ffcfcd6a2b7c8495e77c438d6b91d065bbf5.c3" text="Validation on 145 field specimens from Vietnam and Malaysia showed that the assay was specific without cross reactivity to a number of other infuenza strains as well as human respiratory related pathogens. Detection was 100% from allantoic fluid in H5N1 positive samples, suggesting it to be a reliable sampling source for accurate detection."/>

As shown by the field tested results, this assay would be highly useful as a diagnostic tool to help identify and control influenza epidemics."/>
