  <chunk id="377d9d0d1f580860076b5799e30babd834eda260.c1" text="It has been observed that, historically, strains of pandemic influenza led to succeeding seasonal waves, albeit with decidedly different patterns. Recent studies suggest that the 2009 A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic has had an impact on the circulation patterns of seasonal influenza strains in the post-pandemic years. In this work we aim to investigate this issue and also to compare the relative transmissibility of these waves of differing strains using Taiwan influenza surveillance data before, during and after the pandemic."/>

We further pinpoint the turning points and relative transmissibility of each wave, in order to ascertain whether any temporal pattern exists.">
