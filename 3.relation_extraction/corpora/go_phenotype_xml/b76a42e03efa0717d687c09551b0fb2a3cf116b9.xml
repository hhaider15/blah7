Molecular and phylogenetic analyses were performed on partial fusion gene sequences of HMPV-positive patients. Results. HMPV-positive patients were detected in 2007-2008. The overall infection rate was 4%, while 57% of the patients were children. Sequence analysis demonstrated circulation of subgroup B viruses with predominance of lineage B2. Nucleotide sequence identity within lineage B1 was 98.8%-99.7% and higher than that in lineage B2 (94.3%-100%). Three new amino acid substitutions (T223N, R229K, and D280N) of lineage B2 were observed. Conclusion. HMPV is a major viral pathogen in the Egyptian population especially in children.

Rates of HMPV infection range from 5.5% to 25% among children hospitalized with respiratory illness [24] [25] [26] .">

In young adults (aged 14-25 years), the clinical symptoms of HMPV infection are similar to those of other respiratory viral infections which include cough, rhinorrhea, and expectoration. In contrast, in middle aged (aged 26-65 years) and healthy elderly adults (aged &gt; 65 years), HMPV is similar to influenza infections and common colds [2] . Although the incidence of HMPV infection in healthy adults during winter is generally less than 6% [27] [28] [29] , HMPV is considered to be a major contributor to the burden of respiratory illnesses in older adults [29] .">
