The identification of Pg-activators is therefore an important step in understanding their functional mechanism and derives new therapies. Methods: In this study, different computational methods for predicting plasminogen activator peptide sequences with high accuracy were investigated, including support vector machines (SVM) based on amino acid (AC), dipeptide composition (DC), PSSM profile and Hybrid methods used to predict different Pg-activators from both prokaryotic and eukaryotic origins."/>

Through this study, we have found that the different subfamilies of Pg-activators are quite closely correlated in terms of amino, dipeptide, PSSM and Hybrid compositions. Therefore, our prediction results show that plasminogen activators are predictable with a high accuracy from their primary sequence. Prediction performance was also cross-checked by confusion matrix and ROC (Receiver operating characteristics) analysis. A web server to facilitate the prediction of Pg-activators from primary sequence data was implemented.">

Furthermore, we also have developed a web server, which predicts the Pg-activators and their classification (available online at http://mamsap.it.deakin.edu.au/plas_pred/home.html). Our experimental results show that our approaches are faster and achieve generally a good prediction performance."/>
