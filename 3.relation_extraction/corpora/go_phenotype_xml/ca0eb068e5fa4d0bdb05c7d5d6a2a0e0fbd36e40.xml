This study aimed to determine the performance of pneumococcal load quantified with a real-time polymerase-chain reaction in nasopharyngeal samples to diagnose invasive pneumococcal disease in children."/>

Cases were confirmed by a positive bacterial culture for S. pneumoniae in blood or cerebrospinal fluid. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from cases and controls and pneumococcal density was quantified by lytA real-time polymerase-chain reaction."/>
