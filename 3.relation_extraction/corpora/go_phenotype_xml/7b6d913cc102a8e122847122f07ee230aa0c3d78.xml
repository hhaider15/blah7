  <chunk id="7b6d913cc102a8e122847122f07ee230aa0c3d78.c1" text="With the increase in the availability of metagenomic data generated by next generation sequencing, there is an urgent need for fast and accurate tools for identifying viruses in host-associated and environmental samples. In this paper, we developed a stand-alone pipeline called FastViromeExplorer for the detection and abundance quantification of viruses and phages in large metagenomic datasets by performing rapid searches of virus and phage sequence databases. Both simulated and real data from human microbiome and ocean environmental samples are used to validate FastViromeExplorer as a reliable tool to quickly and accurately identify viruses and their abundances in large datasets.
