  <chunk id="732933f36dc0c57fd8094f545c5e82d7192a13c7.c1" text="Glycyrrhetinic acid monoglucuronide (GAMG) is a great value-added and has considerable commercial interest due to its strong pharmacological activities and functional low-calorie sweetener. However GAMG is quite rare in natural plants, and it must be prepared from glycyrrhizin (GL) by hydrolysing one terminal glucuronic acid. β-Glucuronidase is the key enzyme in the biotransformation of GL to GAMG, but its activities need to be enhanced to facilitate the industrial large-scale production of GAMG. In this study, we identified that isoliquiritigenin (ISL), as one of chemical compositions from the total flavonoids glycyrrhiza (TFG), can significantly enhance β-glucuronidase activity in vitro. Measurements using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) showed that the activity of β-glucuronidase could be increased by 2.66-fold via the addition of ISL to a β-glucuronidase solution that contained GL at a 3:10 molar ratio of ISL to GL. ISL was concluded to be an activator because ISL could reduce the K m and E a of β-glucuronidase reacting with GL. This study sheds new light on the mechanism of βglucuronidase and helps to make industrial production of GAMG through fermentation feasible.">
