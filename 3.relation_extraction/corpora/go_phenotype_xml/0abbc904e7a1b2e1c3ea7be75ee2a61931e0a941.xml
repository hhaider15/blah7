  <chunk id="0abbc904e7a1b2e1c3ea7be75ee2a61931e0a941.c1" text="We describe the development, optimisation, and validation of an automated, cell-based and highthroughput screening assay using existing luminescence-based ATPlite reagents for identifying antiviral compounds that inhibit enterovirus replication. Antiviral efficacy was determined by measuring the ATP levels in cells that were protected from the viral cytopathic effect (CPE) by the antiviral compounds pleconaril and rupintrivir. CPE-based assay conditions were optimised at a cell density of 5000 cells/well and a viral infection dose of 100 CCID 50 in 384-well plates. The assay exhibited excellent robustness, with Zâ€²-factor values between 0.75 and 0.82, coefficients of variation between 0.33% and 1.45%, and signal-to-background ratios ranging from 6.92 to 22.6 when testing three enterovirus A71 isolates circulating in China. The assay was also suitable for screening other picornaviruses, such as poliovirus, coxsackievirus, echovirus, and parechovirus.">

Most EV infections are asymptomatic, but some may lead to illnesses, ranging from mild to more severe, or even life-threatening, such as hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD), aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, myocarditis, pancreatitis, acute flaccid paralysis, and neonatal sepsis 1 . In recent years, outbreaks of HFMD caused by enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) or coxsackievirus A16 have occcured in China and several countries in Southeast Asia 2-6 . To date, there are no approved specific antiviral therapies available to treat diseases caused by EVs. Thus, there is an urgent need to identify safe and broad-spectrum drugs against existing pathogenic EVs.">

Pleconaril is an enteroviral capsid inhibitor that inhibits enterovirus replication by blocking virus uncoating and release of viral RNA into cells 7,8 . Pleconaril was recently reported to have anti-enterovirus efficacy in the treatment of neonatal sepsis 9-11 . Rupintrivir (also known as AG-7088) is an irreversible inhibitor of the picornaviral 3 C protease, with demonstrated activity against rhinoviruses and several EVs 12-14 .">

  <chunk id="0abbc904e7a1b2e1c3ea7be75ee2a61931e0a941.c4" text="To measure cell viability, viral cytopathic effect (CPE) inhibition assays use uptake reagents, such as neutral red, MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide), or crystal violet 15 . Limitations of these colorimetric assays include low throughput, requirement for washing steps, low dynamic range, and low signal-to-noise ratio. Cell debris that remains from infected cells can adhere to the microplate, which can result in high background and low signal-to-noise 15 . To overcome these disadvantages, we implemented an alternative assay format using an adenosine triphosphate (ATP) luminescence readout previously developed and validated for a panel of positive-strand RNA viruses 15 . The ATPlite luminescence assay has been used to measure intracellular ATP as a function of cell number and/or viability 16, 17 . The advantages of these types of assays are their homogeneous nature, their ability to use both adherent or non-adherent cell lines, and amenability to automation and high-throughput screening (HTS). Our experiments sought to confirm this.">
