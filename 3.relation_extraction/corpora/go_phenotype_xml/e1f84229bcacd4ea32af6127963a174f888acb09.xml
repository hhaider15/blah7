Towards understanding the function of the HEV macro domain, we characterized its interaction partners among other HEV encoded proteins. Here, we report that the HEV X-domain directly interacts with the viral methyltransferase and the ORF3 proteins. ORF3 association with the X-domain was mediated through two independent motifs, located within its N-terminal 35aa (amino acids) and C-terminal 63-123aa. Methyltransferase interaction domain was mapped to N-terminal 30-90aa. The X-domain interacted with both ORF3 and methyltransferase through its C-terminal region, involving 66 th ,67 th isoleucine and 101 st ,102 nd leucine, conserved across HEV genotypes. Furthermore, ORF3 and methyltransferase competed with each other for associating with the X-domain. These findings provide molecular understanding of the interaction between the HEV macro domain, methyltransferase and ORF3, suggesting an important role of the macro domain in the life cycle of HEV."/>

It is a positive-sense, single strand, nonenveloped RNA virus with a 7.2 kb genome. It consists of a 5′ -noncoding region (NCR) of 27 to 35 nucleotides, followed by three known open reading frames: ORF1, ORF2 and ORF3 and a 3′ -NCR of 65 to 74 nucleotides, ending with a poly (A) tail of variable length 1 . The 5′ end has m7G cap 6 . The ORF1 encodes the nonstructural proteins: methyltransferase (Met), papain-like cysteine protease (PCP), helicase and RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). It also codes for domains of unknown functions such as X, Y, V and DUF3729 domain 7 . HEV methyltransferase is able to catalyze the transfer of methyl group from S-adenosyl methionine to GTP, to yield m7GTP and also forms a covalent complex with m7GMP, indicating an associated guanylyltransferase activity 8, 9 . PCP has been reported to deubiquitinate interferon-stimulated gene-15 AMC (ubiquitin-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin) 8 . HEV helicase is a nucleoside triphosphatase with the ability to unwind RNA duplexes in the 5′ to 3′ direction 10,11 . Viral RdRp has been shown to be essential for viral replication 12,13 . ORF2 is an N-linked glycoprotein, which forms the viral capsid 14 . ORF2 glycosylation has been demonstrated to be important for the formation of infectious virus particles 15 . ORF2 binds to the 5′ -region of HEV genomic RNA 16 . It has been shown to induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and exploit the ER-associated degradation pathway to gain access to the cytoplasm where it inhibits the host NFκ B activity 17, 18 . The ORF3 is a small phosphoprotein situated between ORF1 and ORF2, overlapping ORF2. It binds to several host proteins and modulates their activity 19 . Importantly, it binds to the tumor susceptibility gene101 (TSG101) and mediates the release of the progeny virus 20,21 .">
