  <chunk id="6cef5ad67e84f17e96de7c2d9af64487a4637cb9.c1" text="The insulated isothermal PCR (iiPCR) technology enables consistent PCR amplification and detection in a simple heating device. A pan-dengue virus (DENV) RT-iiPCR, targeting the 5' untranslated region, was validated previously on the semi-automated POCKIT combo system (involving separate devices for nucleic acid extraction and PCR amplification/detection) to offer performance comparable to a laboratory real-time PCR. Working on the same technologies, a compact automated sample-in-answer-out system (POCKIT Central Nucleic Acid Analyser) has been available commercially for iiPCR, minimizing human error risks and allowing easy molecular bio-detection near points of need. Here, we evaluated the analytical and clinical performance of the pan-DENV RT-iiPCR on the fully automated system by comparison to those on the semi-automated system.">

Furthermore, both fully automated and semi-automated PCR system can detect all four DENV serotypes in mosquitos. Clinical performance of the reagent on the two systems was evaluated by testing 60 human serum samples. Both systems detected the same 40 samples (ten DENV-1, -2, -3, and -4 positive each) and did not detect the other 20; 100% agreement (Îº = 1) was found between the two systems.">
