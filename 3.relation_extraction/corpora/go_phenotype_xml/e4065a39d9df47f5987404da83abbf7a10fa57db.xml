  <chunk id="e4065a39d9df47f5987404da83abbf7a10fa57db.c1" text="Amyloid formation is associated with multiple amyloidosis diseases. Human calcitonin (hCT) is a typical amyloidogenic peptide, its aggregation is associated with medullary carcinoma of the thyroid (MTC), and also limits its clinical application. Magnolia officinalis is a traditional Chinese herbal medicine; its two major polyphenol components, magnolol (Mag) and honokiol (Hon), have displayed multiple functions. Polyphenols like flavonoids and their derivatives have been extensively studied as amyloid inhibitors. However, the anti-amyloidogenic property of a biphenyl backbone containing polyphenols such as Mag and Hon has not been reported. In this study, these two compounds were tested for their effects on hCT aggregation. We found that Mag and Hon both inhibited the amyloid formation of hCT, whereas Mag showed a stronger inhibitory effect; moreover, they both dose-dependently disassembled preformed hCT aggregates. Further immuno-dot blot and dynamic light scattering studies suggested Mag and Hon suppressed the aggregation of hCT both at the oligomerization and the fibrillation stages, while MTT-based and dye-leakage assays demonstrated that Mag and Hon effectively reduced cytotoxicity caused by hCT aggregates. Furthermore, isothermal titration calorimetry indicated Mag and Hon both interact with hCT. Together, our study suggested a potential anti-amyloidogenic property of these two compounds and their structure related derivatives.">

In pathological situations, amyloidogenic proteins aggregate into oligomers, followed by forming extensive linear fibrils, which is accompanied with a structural transition into β -sheet-rich structures 4-9 . Studies have shown that the oligomeric intermediates are the most toxic species during amyloid aggregation 10-13 , which induce cell apoptosis mostly by penetrating the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane 14-16 . Preventing amyloid proteins from aggregating into toxic conformers has thus become a strategy to prevent or treat amyloid diseases 17 .">

Originally, hCT was used to treat osteoporosis and Paget's disease 19,20 , however, due to its high intrinsic tendency to aggregate and the low bioactivity as the result of aggregation, the clinical application of hCT has been discontinued by FDA 21,22 . Moreover, amyloid deposits of hCT have been discovered in patients with medullary carcinoma of the thyroid (MTC), indicating an association between MTC and hCT aggregation 23,24 . Therefore, salmon calcitonin (sCT), which has much lower aggregation propensity but only shares 50% homology to hCT, is clinically used instead 25 . However, hCT has a much higher potency than sCT 26 , and sCT administration can cause side effects like anorexia and vomiting 27,28 . Inhibiting hCT aggregation is thus of great importance both for pharmaceutical preparation of hCT in vitro and for the treatment of MTC.">
