  <chunk id="c36f5134f23a74677ed9d3a39f2eb8b4b19ad6e5.c1" text="We report the complete genome sequence of the first Mexican human coronavirus (HCoV) OC43, obtained by new-generation sequencing and a metagenomic approach, isolated from a child hospitalized with pneumonia. The genome is closely related to the other OC43 genome sequences available, ranging from 99.8% to 98.2% nucleotide sequence identity."/>
