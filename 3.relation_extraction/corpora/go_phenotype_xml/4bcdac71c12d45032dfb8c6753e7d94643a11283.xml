The most effective and economical way to protect against Sudan ebolavirus disease is prophylactic vaccination. However, there are no licensed vaccines to prevent SUDV infections. In this study, a bacterium-like particle (BLP)-based vaccine displaying the extracellular domain of the SUDV glycoprotein (eGP) was developed based on a gram-positive enhancer matrix-protein anchor (GEM-PA) surface display system. Expression of the recombinant GEM-displayed eGP (eGP-PA-GEM) was verified by Western blotting and immunofluorescence assays. The SUDV BLPs (SBLPs), which were mixed with Montanide ISA 201VG plus Poly (I:C) combined adjuvant, could induce high SUDV GP-specific IgG titers of up to 1:40,960 and robust virus-neutralizing antibody titers reached 1:460. The SBLP also elicited T-helper 1 (Th1) and T-helper 2 (Th2) cell-mediated immunity. These data indicate that the SBLP subunit vaccine has the potential to be developed into a promising candidate vaccine against SUDV infections. Viruses 2019, 11, 1149 2 of 15 and receiving unprecedented attention worldwide [4]. Unfortunately, an EVD outbreak occurred again in 2018 in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo and, as of August 2019, a total of 2997 EVD cases had been reported, including 2892 confirmed cases with 1998 deaths (overall case fatality rate of 67%) [5]. Since the first outbreak was reported in 1976, five different species of ebolaviruses, including Ebola virus (EBOV), Sudan virus (SUDV), Reston virus (RESTV), Bundibugyo virus (BDBV), and TaÃ¯ Forest virus (TAFV,) have been identified and their genomic sequences differ by~35-45% [2]">

SUDV has emerged at least six times with average mortality rates of up to 53.76% [6, 7] . Multiple vaccines and monoclonal antibodies against EBOV have been developed, but very few of them can effectively prevent and control SUDV infection [8] . Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a safe and efficacious vaccine against SUDV."/>
  <chunk id="4bcdac71c12d45032dfb8c6753e7d94643a11283.c3" text="The EBOV genome encodes nine structural proteins, including the surface envelope glycoprotein (GP) as the only membrane protein [9] . The mature GP protein forms homotrimers on the surface of infected cells and virions, which is crucial for receptor binding, viral entry, and host immunity induction, making GP an ideal vaccine target [10] . A number of candidate vaccines for EBOV have demonstrated protection against lethal EBOV challenge in animal models and progressed to clinical trials, and most of these vaccines, including DNA vaccines [11], vaccines based on viral vectors, such as recombinant adenovirus [12] and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) [13], and protein-based vaccines, such as virus-like particles (VLPs) [14], have been based on GP. Most notably, a number of the candidate vaccines currently under clinical phase evaluation are viral vector-based vaccines [15, 16] . While recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV)-based and recombinant adenovirus type-5 vector (rAd5)-based EBOV candidate vaccines have been shown to be highly efficacious against EBOV infection and transmission, numerous side effects, such as fever, acute arthritis, and skin lesions, have been reported [15, 17, 18] . In addition, preexisting antibodies, costs, and side effects should also be considered. In contrast, EBOV subunit vaccines may offer a relatively safe alternative for inducing immune responses against an antigen of interest [19, 20] . However, EBOV subunit vaccines would face hurdles related to immunogenicity, thus requiring selection of the antigen delivery vector and an appropriate adjuvant or even adjuvant combinations [15] .">

The GEM-PA surface display system consist of GEM particles based on nonliving and nongenetically modified gram-positive Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis) bacteria and a PA derived from the L. lactis peptidoglycan hydrolase AcmA [22] . Antigens fused with the PA can be anchored effectively and stably to the peptidoglycan of GEM particles and induce antigen-specific immune responses [23] .
