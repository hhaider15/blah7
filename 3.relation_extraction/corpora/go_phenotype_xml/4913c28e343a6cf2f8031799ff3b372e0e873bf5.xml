  <chunk id="4913c28e343a6cf2f8031799ff3b372e0e873bf5.c1" text="First identified in The Netherlands in 2004, human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) was found to cause worldwide infections. Patients infected by HCoV-NL63 are typically young children with upper and lower respiratory tract infection, presenting with symptoms including croup, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia. Unfortunately, there are currently no effective antiviral therapy to contain HCoV-NL63 infection. CoV genomes encode an integral viral component, main protease (M pro ), which is essential for viral replication through proteolytic processing of RNA replicase machinery. Due to the sequence and structural conservation among all CoVs, M pro has been recognized as an attractive molecular target for rational anti-CoV drug design. Here we present the crystal structure of HCoV-NL63 M pro in complex with a Michael acceptor inhibitor N3. Structural analysis, consistent with biochemical inhibition results, reveals the molecular mechanism of enzyme inhibition at the highly conservative substrate-recognition pocket. We show such molecular target remains unchanged across 30 clinical isolates of HCoV-NL63 strains. Through comparative study with M pro s from other human CoVs (including the deadly SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) and their related zoonotic CoVs, our structure of HCoV-NL63 M pro provides critical insight into rational development of wide spectrum antiviral therapeutics to treat infections caused by human CoVs."/>

CoVs have been identified in a wide variety of hosts, including mammals and birds, and are shown to cause a number of respiratory and enteric diseases 1,3,4 . In 2003, the global epidemic of an atypical form of pneumonia named severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) led to the discovery of SARS-CoV, a previously unknown CoV, as the etiologic pathogen 5-8 . Started in South China, SARS outbreak quickly resulted in more than 800 deaths worldwide 9 . Patients with SARS-CoV infection developed diffuse alveolar damage with the potential to progress into acute respiratory distress syndrome and eventually death 10 . Almost 10 years later, another previously unknown CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), was found to cause a new epidemic starting in the Arabian Peninsula in 2012 [11] [12] [13] . MERS infection led to acute pneumonia and renal failure, with mortality rate as high as 50% in hospitalized patients 14, 15 . In addition to the deadly SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, 4 other human CoVs have been identified so far, namely HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1, which are known to cause comparatively mild common colds 9,16,17 . According to their genomic sequences, these 6 HCoVs are further classified into alphacoronavirus genus (HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63) and betacoronavirus genus (HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV) 12,18 . The emergence of CoV infection in human beings are believed to begin with zoonotic transmission from animal reservoirs 9 . For example, high degree of genomic sequence similarity was shown between bovine CoV and HCoV-OC43, suggesting a relatively recent animal-to-human transmission 11, 19 . In the case of human SARS-CoV, recent studies identified several SARS-like bat CoVs with over 95% genomic sequence identity, suggesting bats as the potential zoonotic reservoir 20-22 . While dromedary camels are suspected to be either reservoir or vector for MERS, as genomic sequence of isolated dromedary MERS-CoV was found identical to that of human MERS-CoV 23-25 .">

HCoV-NL63 has been documented to circulate in human population worldwide 26-33 , and is considered the causative pathogen for up to 10% of all respiratory illnesses 34-37 . Infected patients are typically young children with upper and lower respiratory tract infection, presenting with symptoms including croup, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia 38,39 . Nevertheless, infections in adults have also been reported, though consequences could be more severe in those with compromised immune system or other comorbidities [40] [41] [42] . Similar to SARS-CoV, HCoV-NL63 also uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the receptor for cellular entry 43 . Full genome sequences of HCoV-NL63 have been determined, revealing a mosaic structure with multiple recombination sites which indicate that possible mutation and recombination could occur when co-infected with other CoVs 44,45 . Based on molecular clock analysis, HCoV-NL63 shares common ancestry with bat alphacoronavirus sequences, with probable divergence 563-822 years ago 46 . However, the direct bat ancestor of HCoV-NL63 has not been found yet 47 .">

From a public health perspective, no effective antiviral strategy is available in face of future CoV emergence, potentially transmitted from the vast and mutable zoonotic reservoir. Previously, we have demonstrated that main protease (M pro ) is a conserved drug target throughout the subfamily Coronavirinae, which is suitable for designing wide-spectrum inhibitors 48, 49 . The 5′ two-thirds of coronaviral genome is consisted of open reading frame 1 (ORF1), which encodes two large polypeptides of the replicase machinery: pp1a, and through ribosomal frameshift, pp1ab 18 . These two polypeptides are cotranslationally cleaved into mature nonstructural proteins (Nsps) through two proteases encoded in the 5′ region of ORF1: papain-like protease (PLP) and 3C-like protease (3CL or Nsp5) 50,51 . 3CL protease is more commonly known as M pro because of its dominant role in the posttranslational processing of the replicase polyprotein. The M pro s from different human and animal CoVs are known to share significant homology in both primary amino acid sequence and 3D architecture, providing a strong structural basis for designing wide-spectrum anti-CoV inhibitors 48,49,52-55 . They employ a similar substrate-binding pocket, usually with a requirement for glutamine at P1 position and a preference for leucine/methionine at P2 position. Interestingly, in contrast to other HCoVs, only HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 exhibit a unique substrate preference of histidine in P1 position at the cleavage site between nsp13 and nsp14 37,53 . The structural and pharmaceutical significance of the P1 position preference of HCoV-NL63 M pro remains to be addressed.">
