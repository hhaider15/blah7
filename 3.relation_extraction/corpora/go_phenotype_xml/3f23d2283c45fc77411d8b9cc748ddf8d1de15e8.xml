The MERS-CoV genome encodes four major structural proteins, among which the spike (S) protein has a key role in viral infection and pathogenesis. The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S protein contains a critical neutralizing domain and is an important target for development of MERS vaccines and therapeutics. In this review, we describe the relevant features of the MERS-CoV S-protein RBD, summarize recent advances in the development of MERS-CoV RBD-based vaccines and therapeutic antibodies, and illustrate potential challenges and strategies to further improve their efficacy.">

In addition to camel-to-camel transmission of MERS-CoV, camel-to-human transmission can occur via direct or indirect contact with sick animals [35] . There is a high prevalence of MERS-CoV infection in camel workers, particularly in Saudi Arabia [27] . Following infection of individuals, human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV occurs frequently, and mainly contributes to community or healthcare-associated outbreaks [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] . Infection of humans by MERS-CoV, which mainly occurs through the lower respiratory tract, causes severe respiratory symptoms, leading to failure of the respiratory system and/or other organs [7, 46, 47] . On rare occasions, the human intestinal tract can be an alternative infection route [46, 48] .">

Antibody responses, and particularly neutralizing antibody responses, are crucial factors in the successful treatment of MERS-CoV infections in humans [50] [51] [52] . In this regard, the plasma of convalescent MERS-CoV-infected patients is useful for treatment of MERS-CoV infection clinically, but it requires a neutralizing antibody titer (e.g., 50% plaque-reduction neutralization titer: PRNT 50 ) ≥1:80 to obtain effective therapeutic results [51] [52] [53] . Currently, a human polyclonal IgG antibody (SAB-301) that is produced by transchromosomic cattle immunized with a MERS-CoV vaccine [54], as well as several vaccine candidates (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03399578; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03615911) [55], have been tested in human clinical trials. However, as yet no vaccines or therapeutic agents have been approved for the prevention or treatment of MERS, indicating the need for further development of novel and effective vaccines and therapeutics against MERS-CoV infection.">

MERS-CoV is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus with a genome that encodes the structural proteins S, envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N), as well as non-structural proteins (nsp1-16) translated from open reading frames (ORFs) 1a and 1b, and several accessory proteins, such as 3, 4a, 4b, 5, and 8b ( Figure 1A ,B) [58] [59] [60] [61] . The functions of these proteins have been elucidated. As an example, nsp1 is known to have an endonucleolytic RNA-cleavage function in the promotion of infectious virus particle production in human cells [62] , and it also participates in efficient viral replication through interaction with viral RNA, probably via a cis-acting element at the 5 -terminal coding region [63] . Evidence indicates that nsp16 is necessary for interferon resistance and viral pathogenesis [64], whereas nsp15 is a nidoviral uridylate-specific endoribonuclease, the structure of which has recently been resolved, and its activity may be mediated by catalytic residues, oligomeric assembly, or RNA-binding efficiency [65] . In addition, 4a protein recognizes and binds double-stranded (ds)RNA, in which four residues of the protein might be crucial for 4a-dsRNA stability [66] , and it also inhibits protein kinase R-mediated antiviral stress responses [67] . 4a mediated-inhibition of stress-granule formation may facilitate viral translation, resulting in efficient MERS-CoV replication [68]. The MERS-CoV 4b protein interferes with the NF-κB-dependent innate immune response during infection [69]. Viruses 2019, 11, 60 3 of 18 Viruses 2018, 10, 3 Viruses 2019, 11, 60 4 of 18 events [87]">
