Relative to the respective lowest quartile of air pollutants, the adjusted relative risks (RRs) of the outpatient visits in the highest quartile were 1.10 (P-trend = 0.013) for carbon monoxide (CO), 1.10 (P-trend = 0.015) for nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ), and 1.20 (P-trend , 0.0001) for particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter !10mm (PM 10 ) in the child group (aged 0-18). For adults aged 19-44, the RRs of outpatient visits were 1.13 (P-trend = 0.078) for CO, 1.17 (P-trend = 0.002) for NO 2, and 1.13 (P-trend , 0.0001) for PM 10 . For adults aged 45-64, the RRs of outpatient visits were 1.15 (P-trend = 0.003) for CO, 1.19 (Ptrend = 0.0002) for NO 2, and 1.10 (P-trend = 0.001) for PM 10 . For the elderly (aged$ 65), the RRs of outpatient visits in were 1.12 (P-trend = 0.003) for NO 2 and 1.10 (P-trend = 0.006) for PM 10. For inpatient visits, the RRs across quartiles of CO level were 1.00, 1.70, 1.92, and 1.86 (P-trend = 0.0001) in the child group. There were no significant linear associations between inpatient visits and air pollutants in other groups."/>
