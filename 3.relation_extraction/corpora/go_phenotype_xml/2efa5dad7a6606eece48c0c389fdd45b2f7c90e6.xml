  <chunk id="2efa5dad7a6606eece48c0c389fdd45b2f7c90e6.c1" text="Influenza is a highly contagious virus that causes seasonal epidemics and unpredictable pandemics. Four influenza virus types have been identified to date: A, B, C and D, with only A-C known to infect humans. Influenza A and B viruses are responsible for seasonal influenza epidemics in humans and are responsible for up to a billion flu infections annually. The M2 protein is present in all influenza types and belongs to the class of viroporins, i.e., small proteins that form ion channels that increase membrane permeability in virus-infected cells. In influenza A and B, AM2 and BM2 are predominantly proton channels, although they also show some permeability to monovalent cations. By contrast, M2 proteins in influenza C and D, CM2 and DM2, appear to be especially selective for chloride ions, with possibly some permeability to protons. These differences point to different biological roles for M2 in types A and B versus C and D, which is also reflected in their sequences. AM2 is by far the best characterized viroporin, where mechanistic details and rationale of its acid activation, proton selectivity, unidirectionality, and relative low conductance are beginning to be understood. The present review summarizes the biochemical and structural aspects of influenza viroporins and discusses the most relevant aspects of function, inhibition, and interaction with the host.">

  <chunk id="2efa5dad7a6606eece48c0c389fdd45b2f7c90e6.c7" text="AM2 forms an acid-activated proton channel with an asymmetrical preference of proton conduction from the viral exterior (N-terminus) to the interior (C-terminus). The proton channel activity of AM2 is essential for two important roles. Upon viral entry into cells via sialic acid-containing receptor-mediated endocytosis, the low pH (5 to 6) of late endosomes activates the proton channel activity of AM2, which acidifies the viral interior [25] with subsequent detachment of M1 from the vRNP complex. This enables trafficking of vRNPs into the host cell nucleus for synthesis of mRNA and vRNA [29, 30] . The channel activity of M2 is also crucial during viral maturation, where it equilibrates the pH across the trans-Golgi membrane to prevent the viral HA from undergoing premature conformational change while being transported to the plasma membrane of infected cells [31] [32] [33] [34] . Conductance and inhibition studies have used the transmembrane domain of AM2 (AM2-TM), since in Xenopus oocytes AM2(21-51) has retained the proton selectivity and drug sensitivity observed in full-length AM2 protein [35] .">
