  <chunk id="ff2b36ea32d849a577ae66637bbe359f108f35d8.c1" text="Mathematical models and field data suggest that human mobility is an important driver for Dengue virus transmission. Nonetheless little is known on this matter due the lack of instruments for precise mobility quantification and study design difficulties."/>
  <chunk id="ff2b36ea32d849a577ae66637bbe359f108f35d8.c2" text="We carried out a cohort-nested, case-control study with 126 individuals (42 cases, 42 intradomestic controls and 42 population controls) with the goal of describing human mobility patterns of recently Dengue virus-infected subjects, and comparing them with those of noninfected subjects living in an urban endemic locality. Mobility was quantified using a GPSdata logger registering waypoints at 60-second intervals for a minimum of 15 natural days."/>

Additionally, cases had a larger number of visits out of the municipalityÂ´s administrative limits when compared to PLOS ONE |">
