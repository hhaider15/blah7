This study used microarray-based transcriptomic analysis of PBMCs from experimentally infected pigs to explore the patterns of immune dysregulation after infection with two East European PRRSV strains from subtype 2 (BOR and ILI) in comparison to a Danish subtype 1 strain (DAN). Transcriptional profiles were determined at day 7 post infection in three tested groups of pigs and analysed in comparison with the expression profile of control group. Microarray analysis revealed differential regulation (&gt; 1.5-fold change) of 4253 and 7335 genes in groups infected with BOR and ILI strains, respectively, and of 12518 genes in pigs infected with Danish strain. Subtype 2 PRRSV strains showed greater induction of many genes, especially those involved in innate immunity, such as interferon stimulated antiviral genes and inflammatory markers. Functional analysis of the microarray data revealed a significant up-regulation of genes involved in processes such as acute phase response, granulocyte and agranulocyte adhesion and diapedesis, as well as down-regulation of genes enrolled in pathways engaged in protein synthesis, cell division, as well as B and T cell signaling. This study provided an insight into the host response to three different PRRSV strains at a molecular level and demonstrated variability between strains of different pathogenicity level.">
