However, the lack of bat specific reagents, in particular antibodies, has limited our knowledge of bat's immunity. Using crossreactive antibodies, we report the phenotypic and functional characterization of T cell subsets, B and NK cells in the fruit-eating bat Pteropus alecto. Our findings indicate the predominance of CD8 + T cells in the spleen from wild-caught bats that may reflect either the presence of viruses in this organ or predominance of this cell subset at steady state. Instead majority of T cells in circulation, lymph nodes and bone marrow (BM) were CD4 + subsets. Interestingly, 40% of spleen T cells expressed constitutively IL-17, IL-22 and TGF-Î² mRNA, which may indicate a strong bias towards the Th17 and regulatory T cell subsets. Furthermore, the unexpected high number of T cells in bats BM could suggest an important role in T cell development. Finally, mitogenic stimulation induced proliferation and production of effector molecules by bats immune cells. This work contributes to a better understanding of bat's immunity, opening up new perspectives of therapeutic interventions for humans.">

Bats have also been proposed as potential reservoir for Ebola 3 and MERS 4 , although direct evidence is still lacking. How do bats cope with viruses that have a high mortality rate in humans without getting sick? How have they evolved to co-exist with such viruses? Understanding the bats immune system should help address this question and might open a door to new therapeutic interventions for humans."/>
  <chunk id="bca82a8723c167333ef1d73d5bf0fd900f30b695.c3" text="Immunity in mammals comprises two main arms, namely the innate and the adaptive immunity, that interact with each other to generate optimal responses against pathogens. The innate immunity provides immediate nonspecific host defenses and is highly conserved among species; whereas the adaptive immunity is restricted to higher organisms and involves antigen-specific T and B cells 5 . Pathogen-derived antigens are presented by antigen presenting cells (APC) such as macrophages and dendritic cells (DC) to antigen-specific T and B cells in secondary lymphoid organs such as lymph nodes, spleen and various mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues (MALT) 6 . The antigen-specific T or B cells get then activated, proliferate and migrate to the site of infection where they fight the invading pathogen through antibody production and/or direct killing of the infected cells.">
