  <chunk id="05aeae1608e74b17f7c92bc7661e98742e0b3fb6.c1" text="Ubl2 domain from MERS PLpro has no effect on its ability to process the viral polyprotein or act as an interferon antagonist, which involves deubiquitinating and deISGylating cellular proteins. Here, we test the hypothesis that the Ubl2 domain is not required for the catalytic function of MERS PLpro in vitro. The X-ray structure of MERS PLpro-∆Ubl2 was determined to 1.9 Å and compared to PLpro containing the N-terminal Ubl2 domain. While the structures were nearly identical, the PLpro-∆Ubl2 enzyme revealed the intact structure of the substrate-binding loop. Moreover, PLpro-∆Ubl2 catalysis against different substrates and a purported inhibitor revealed no differences in catalytic efficiency, substrate specificity, and inhibition. Further, no changes in thermal stability were observed between enzymes. We conclude that the catalytic core of MERS PLpro, i.e. without the Ubl2 domain, is sufficient for catalysis and stability in vitro with utility to evaluate potential inhibitors as a platform for structure-based drug design."/>

Approximately 10 years after emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002/2003, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged and has been identified so far in 26 countries with a case-fatality rate over 30% 1,2 . Although these CoVs are well-recognized global pathogens, there are no antiviral interventions available. Thus, a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that facilitate viral pathogenesis and replication may permit the design of targeted therapeutics against CoVs.">

The first 22 kilobases located at the 5′ -end of the RNA genome is encoded in two open reading frames (ORF1a/ORF1b) that are translated by host ribosomes to generate two respective viral polyproteins (pp1a &amp; pp1ab). Pp1a and pp1ab are processed by two virus-encoded cysteine proteases, termed the papain-like protease (PLpro) and the 3C-like protease (3CLpro). Together, these two proteases cleave the polyproteins to produce 16 nonstructural proteins (nsps), which are essential for the formation of the replicase complex and hence RNA replication. This study focuses on the multifunctional and putative drug target, PLpro, located in nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3; Fig. 1a )."/>
