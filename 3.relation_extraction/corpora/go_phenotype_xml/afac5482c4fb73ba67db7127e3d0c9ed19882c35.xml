Here, we demonstrate that bats of the genus Eptesicus have preserved for more than 11.8 million years an EBLL element named eEBLL-1, which has an intact open reading frame of 1,718 codons. The eEBLL-1 coding sequence revealed that functional motifs essential for mononegaviral RdRp activity are well conserved in the EBLL-1 genes. Genetic analyses showed that natural selection operated on eEBLL-1 during the evolution of Eptesicus. Notably, we detected efficient transcription of eEBLL-1 in tissues from Eptesicus bats. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first report showing that the eukaryotic genome has gained a riboviral polymerase gene from an ancient virus that has the potential to encode a functional RdRp.">

The best known examples of EVEs are endogenous retroviruses (ERVs). Retrovirus genomes integrate into the host genomic DNA as part of their replication cycle, and retroviruses become endogenous when the viruses infect host germline cells. ERVs are molecular fossils of past retrovirus infection events and provide interesting insights into co-evolution between retroviruses and their hosts 1 . Interestingly, some genes that originated from ERVs have allowed the implementation of new biological host features (i.e., placentation in mammalian species), demonstrating that viral sequences can be sources of genetic novelty in eukaryotes 2-5 .">

Although the bornavirus replication cycle lacks DNA intermediates, we and others have found that EVEs descended from bornaviruses exist in the genomes of eukaryotes; these EVEs are designated endogenous bornavirus-like (EBL) elements 9-12 . To date, EBLN, EBLM, EBLG and EBLL elements homologous to the N (nucleoprotein), M (matrix protein), G (envelope glycoprotein) and L (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase: RdRp) genes of bornaviruses, respectively, have been discovered. Among these elements, the EBLNs have been well">
