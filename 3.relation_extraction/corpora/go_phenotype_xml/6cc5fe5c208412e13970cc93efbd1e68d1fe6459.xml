  <chunk id="6cc5fe5c208412e13970cc93efbd1e68d1fe6459.c1" text="Background: Human Malawi polyomavirus (MWPyV) was discovered in 2012, but its prevalence and clinical characteristics are largely unknown. Methods: We used real-time TaqMan-based PCR to detect MWPyV in the feces (n = 174) of children with diarrhea, nasopharyngeal aspirates (n = 887) from children with respiratory infections, and sera (n = 200) from healthy adults, and analyzed its clinical characteristics statistically. All the MWPyV-positive specimens were also screened for other common respiratory viruses.">

  <chunk id="6cc5fe5c208412e13970cc93efbd1e68d1fe6459.c2" text="Results: Sixteen specimens were positive for MWPyV, including 13 (1.47%) respiratory samples and three (1.7%) fecal samples. The samples were all co-infected with other respiratory viruses, most commonly with influenza viruses (69.2%) and human coronaviruses (30.7%). The MWPyV-positive children were diagnosed with bronchopneumonia or viral diarrhea. They ranged in age from 12 days to 9 years, and the most frequent symptoms were cough and fever. Conclusions: Real-time PCR is an effective tool for the detection of MWPyV in different types of samples. MWPyV infection mainly occurs in young children, and fecal-oral transmission is a possible route of its transmission.">
