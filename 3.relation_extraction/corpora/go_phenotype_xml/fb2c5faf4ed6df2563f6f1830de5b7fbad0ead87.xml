It is characterized by episodes of infection that involve hundreds of millions of people each year. Since that in the seasons 2010-2011 and 2011-2012 the circulation of FLUB was decreasing we evaluated the clinical presentation, demographic characteristics, admitting department, and length of stay in children who contracted influenza admitted to Bambino GesÃ¹ Children's Hospital, during the 2012-2013 influenza season, with the aim to establish if the recover of FLUB was associated to a clinical worsening, in comparison with those due to FLUA. Methods: A total of 133 respiratory specimens, collected from patients with symptoms of respiratory tract infections, positive for the Influenza A and B viruses (FLUA and B) were subtyped. Comparisons between the FLUA and FLUB groups were performed with the one-way ANOVA for continuous parametric variables, the Mann-Whitney test for non-parametric variables, or the Chi-Square test or Fisher's exact test (if cells &lt;5) for categorical variables. Results: 87.09 % of the FLUA isolates were the H1N1 subtype and 12.90 % were H3N2. Among the FLUB isolates, 91.54 % were the B/Yamagata/16/88 lineage and 8.45 % were the B/Victoria/02/87 lineage. The largest number of FLUA/H1N1 cases was observed in children less than 1 years old, while the B/Yamagata/16/88 lineage was most prevalent in children 3-6 years old. Fever was a common symptom for both FLUA and B affected patients. However, respiratory symptoms were more prevalent in patients affected by FLUA. The median length of stay in the hospital was 5 days for FLUA and 3 days for FLUB. Conclusions: The clinical features correlated to different Influenza viruses, and relevant subtypes, were evaluated concluding that the increasing of FLUB in the season 2012-2013 was without any dramatic change in clinical manifestation. Our findings suggest, finally, that a stronger commitment to managing patients affected by FLUA is required, as the disease is more severe than FLUB.">
