The objective of the present study was to find out whether plasma concentrations of MBL and vitamin D are different in patients with dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF).">

  <chunk id="9491f89b53c527904943035f8b4a1f997c3609ad.c2" text="The results: The plasma concentrations of vitamin D and MBL were assessed in 48 DF cases, 45 DHF cases and 20 apparently healthy controls using ELISA based methods. Vitamin D concentrations were found to be higher among both DF and DHF cases as compared to healthy controls (P &lt; 0.005 and P &lt; 0.001). Vitamin D concentrations were not different between DF and DHF cases. When the dengue cases were classified into primary and secondary infections, secondary DHF cases had significantly higher concentrations of vitamin D as compared to secondary DF cases (P &lt; 0.050). MBL concentrations were not significantly different between healthy controls and dengue cases. MBL concentrations were observed to be lower in DHF cases as compared to DF cases (P &lt; 0.050). Although MBL levels were not different DF and DHF cases based on immune status, the percentage of primary DHF cases (50%) having MBL levels lower than 500 ng/ml were less compared to primary DF cases (P = 0.038). Conclusions: The present study suggests that higher concentrations of vitamin D might be associated with secondary DHF while deficiency of MBL may be associated with primary DHF.">
