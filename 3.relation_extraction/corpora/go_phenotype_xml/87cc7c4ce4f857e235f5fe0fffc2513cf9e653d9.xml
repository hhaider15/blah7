It infects pigs of all ages, and causes severe diarrhea and high mortality rates in newborn pigs, leading to devastating economic losses in the pork industry worldwide. Effective and safe vaccines against highly virulent PEDV strains are still unavailable, hampering the further prevention, control and eradication of the disease in herds. Vaccination of pregnant sows with live attenuated vaccines (LAVs) is the most effective strategy to induce lactogenic immunity in the sows, which provides A passive protection of suckling piglets against PEDV via the colostrum (beestings, or first milk) and milk. Several LAV candidates have been developed via serially passaging the highly virulent PEDV isolates in non-porcine Vero cells. However, their efficacies in the induction of sufficient protection against virulent PEDV challenge vary in vivo. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of the virulence-related mutations of PEDV and their potential roles in PEDV attenuation in vivo. With the successful development of reverse genetics systems for PEDV, we also discuss how to use them to generate promising LAV candidates that are safe, effective and genetically stable. This article provides timely insight into the rational design of effective and safe PEDV LAV candidates. entry. These two steps are mediated by the two functional subunits of the S protein, S1 and S2, respectively. Currently, the protein receptor for PEDV entry remains unknown [7, 8] . The structural proteins M and E mainly mediate the assembly of enveloped viral particles [9] . The N protein is a multifunctional viral protein involved in multiple steps in viral replication and regulating host functions [10] [11] [12] [13] . The accessory protein ORF3 is identified as an ion channel and has multiple regulatory functions [14] [15] [16] . Figure 1. Schematic organization of the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) genome, polypeptides pp1a and pp1ab. The genome encodes open reading frames 1a (ORF1a) and 1b (ORF1b), followed by the genes encoding spike protein (S), accessory protein 3 (ORF3), envelope protein (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. Translation of ORF1a and 1b results in two polypeptides pp1a and pp1ab, mediated by a −1 frame-shifting signal [5]. The polypeptides are protease-processed into 16 non-structural proteins (nsps).

Since then, this virus has been identified throughout different countries in Europe and Asia [18] . These PEDV strains are classified as the classical strains or genotype 1a (G1a) strains based on the S genes/proteins [19] . Due to the fact that G1a PEDV strains cause moderate mortality in neonatal piglets and the increased biosecurity practices on farms in Europe, PEDV had limited economic impacts, and no PEDV vaccines have been developed in Europe [20] . On the other hand, G1a PEDV had caused significant economic losses in Asian countries from the 1980s to the 2000s. Vaccines were developed and applied in the field, including several live attenuated vaccines (LAVs) that were generated by passaging virulent G1a PEDV isolates in Vero cells, a simian kidney epithelial cell line that is deficient in type I interferon production but expresses interferon receptors [21] . In Japan, P-5V was employed as a commercial intramuscular (IM) LAV since 1997 [22, 23] . In China, a bivalent LAV composed of the PEDV CV777 strain and the TGEV H strain was licensed in 1999 [24] . Subsequently, a trivalent LAV containing these two viruses and a porcine rotavirus strain NX was licensed in China in 2015 [25] . In South Korea, LAVs using PEDV strains KPEDV-9 and DR13 were licensed in 1999 and 2004, respectively [26,27].">

Many G1a LAV-vaccinated swine farms still suffered from these highly virulent PEDV outbreaks [1, 25] , suggesting that the efficacy of G1a LAVs against the emerging PEDV strains was minimal, and that PEDV vaccines based on those new strains are needed."/>

J. Mol. Sci. 2019, 20, 5478 9 of 14 are not commercially available. Reverse genetics technology provides a very useful platform in studying the virulence-related mutations and in the rational design of PEDV LAV candidates. As a member of the Coronaviridae family, PEDV shares many similar gene functions with other CoVs. Although current understanding of PEDV biology is still limited, knowledge from other CoVs may aid in the identification of mutagenesis targets and help achieve the optimal balance between attenuation and immunogenicity. An ideal PEDV LAV should replicate effectively in pig intestines, not cause diseases, induce enough protective immune responses and not revert to a virulent phenotype. In the future, rationally designed PEDV LAV candidates bearing different genetic modifications should be evaluated in pregnant sows that are the major targets of PEDV vaccination, and can passively protect suckling piglets from PEDV disease via the PEDV-specific neutralizing antibodies in colostrum and milk."/>
