  <chunk id="0e803f9a98199d4c1e322f933e9943db653460be.c1" text="Background: Dengue virus (DENV), the most widely prevalent arbovirus, continues to be a threat to human health in the tropics and subtropics. Early and rapid detection of DENV infection during the acute phase of illness is crucial for proper clinical patient management and preventing the spread of infection. The aim of the current study was to develop a specific, sensitive, and robust reverse transcriptase loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay for detection and differentiation of DENV1-4 serotypes.">

No cross-reactions of the four serotypes were observed during the tests. The detection limits of the DENV1-4-specific RT-LAMP assays were approximately 10-copy templates per reaction. The RT-LAMP assays were ten-fold more sensitive than RT-PCR or real-time PCR. The diagnostic rate was 100 % for clinical strains of DENV, and 98.9 % of the DENV-infected patients whose samples were tested were detected by RT-LAMP. Importantly, no false-positives were detected with the new equipment and methodology that was used to avoid aerosol contamination of the samples. Conclusion: The RT-LAMP method used in our study is specific, sensitive, and suitable for further investigation as a useful alternative to the current methods used for clinical diagnosis of DENV1-4, especially in hospitals and laboratories that lack sophisticated diagnostic systems."/>

There are four distinct serotypes, described as DENV1, DENV2, DENV3, and DENV4 [2]. DENV infection causes dengue fever, the more dangerous dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome, all of which are very contagious [3] . According to a World Health Organization report, there are 50 million DENV infections and 500,000 cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever annually, the latter requiring hospitalization [4]. In 2014, there was an outbreak of dengue fever in China and countries within Southeast Asia, with more than 50,000 DENV-infected people in southern China. DENV infections are not only a threat to human health, but also cause huge economic losses to society.">
