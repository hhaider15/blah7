Molecular epidemiological data are limited for HRV circulating in the Southern Hemisphere. Objectives: To identify the species and genotypes of HRV from clinical samples collected in Sydney, Australia, from 2006 to 2009. Methods: Combined nose and throat swabs or nasopharyngeal aspirates collected from individuals with ILI were tested for HRV using real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Sequencing data of 5′UTR and VP4/VP2 coding regions on RT-PCR-positive specimens were analysed. Results: Human rhinoviruses were detected by real-time PCR in 20.9% (116/555) of samples tested. Phylogenetic analysis of 5′UTR and VP4/VP2 on HRV-positive samples was concordant in the grouping of HRV A and B species but not HRV C species.">

Discordant branching was seen within HRV A group: two sequences clustering as A in the VP4/VP2 tree branched within the C/A subspecies in the 5′UTR tree, and one sequence showed identity to different HRV A strains in the two genes. The prevalence of HRV C and C/A species was greater in paediatric compared to adult patients (47.9% vs 25.5%, P = .032)."/>
