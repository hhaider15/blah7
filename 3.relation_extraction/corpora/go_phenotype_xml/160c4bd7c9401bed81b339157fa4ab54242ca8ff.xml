Macrophages, important cells of innate immunity, are directly involved in cellular interactions with pathogens, the release of cytokines activating other immune cells and antigen presentation to cells of the adaptive immune response. IFNÎ³ is a potent activator of macrophages and increased production has been associated with disease resistance in several species. This study characterizes the molecular basis for dramatically different nitric oxide production and immune function between the B2 and the B19 haplotype chicken macrophages.A large-scale RNA sequencing approach was employed to sequence the RNA of purified macrophages from each haplotype group (B2 vs. B19) during differentiation and after stimulation. Our results demonstrate that a large number of genes exhibit divergent expression between B2 and B19 haplotype cells both prior and after stimulation. These differences in gene expression appear to be regulated by complex epigenetic mechanisms that need further investigation.
