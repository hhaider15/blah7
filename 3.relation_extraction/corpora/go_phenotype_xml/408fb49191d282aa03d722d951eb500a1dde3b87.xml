  <chunk id="408fb49191d282aa03d722d951eb500a1dde3b87.c1" text="Background: Clinical trials applying iota-carrageenan nasal spray have previously shown to reduce duration of virus-confirmed common cold. The present study pooled data of two similar clinical trials to provide further evidence for the antiviral effectiveness of carrageenan. Methods: Individual patient data were analyzed from two randomized double blind placebo controlled trials assessing the therapeutic effectiveness of carrageenan nasal spray in acute common cold. Patients with virus-confirmed common cold (n = 254, verum 126, placebo 128) were included and the following parameters were appraised: duration of disease, number of patients with relapses, number of respiratory viruses and viral titers at inclusion (visit 1) compared to days 3-5 (visit 2). Results: Carrageenan treated patients showed a significant reduction in duration of disease of almost 2 days (p &lt; 0.05) as well as significantly fewer relapses during 21 days of observation period (p &lt; 0.05). The virus clearance between visit 1 and visit 2 was significantly more pronounced in the carrageenan group (p &lt; 0.05). In both studies, virus-confirmed common cold was caused by three main virus subtypes: human rhinovirus (46%), human coronavirus (25%) and influenza A (14%) virus. Carrageenan nasal spray showed significant antiviral efficacy in all three virus subgroups, the highest effectiveness was observed in human corona virus-infected patients. The reduced duration of disease was 3 days (p &lt; 0.01) and the number of relapses was three times less (p &lt; 0.01) in carrageenan treated corona-virus-infected patients compared to control patients.">
