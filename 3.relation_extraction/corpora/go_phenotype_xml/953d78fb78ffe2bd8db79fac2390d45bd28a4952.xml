  <chunk id="953d78fb78ffe2bd8db79fac2390d45bd28a4952.c1" text="Background: CCR5 is a CC chemokine receptor involved in the migration of effector leukocytes including macrophages, NK, and T cells into inflamed tissues. Also, the role of CCR5 in CD4 + Foxp3 + regulatory T cell (Treg) homing has recently begun to grab attention. Japanese encephalitis (JE) is defined as severe neuroinflammation of the central nervous system (CNS) following infection with mosquito-borne flavivirus JE virus. However, the potential contribution of CCR5 to JE progression via mediating CD4 + Foxp3 + Treg homing has not been investigated. Methods: Infected wild-type (Ccr5 +/+ ) and CCR5-deficient (Ccr5 −/− ) mice were examined daily for mortality and clinical signs, and neuroinflammation in the CNS was evaluated by infiltration of inflammatory leukocytes and cytokine expression. In addition, viral burden, NK-and JEV-specific T cell responses were analyzed. Adoptive transfer of CCR5 + CD4 + Foxp3 + Tregs was used to evaluate the role of Tregs in JE progression.">

Compared to Ccr5 +/+ mice, Ccr5 −/− mice unexpectedly showed increased responses of IFN-γ + NK and CD8 + T cells in the spleen, but not CD4 + T cells. More interestingly, CCR5-ablation resulted in a skewed response to IL-17 + CD4 + Th17 cells and correspondingly reduced CD4 + Foxp3 + Tregs in the spleen and brain, which was closely associated with exacerbated JE. Our results also revealed that adoptive transfer of sorted CCR5 + CD4 + Foxp3 + Tregs into Ccr5 −/− mice could ameliorate JE progression without apparently altering the viral burden and CNS infiltration of IL-17 + CD4 + Th17 cells, myeloid-derived Ly-6C hi monocytes and Ly-6G hi granulocytes. Instead, adoptive transfer of CCR5 + CD4 + Foxp3 + Tregs into Ccr5 −/− mice resulted in increased expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10 and TGF-β) in the spleen and brain, and transferred CCR5 + Tregs were found to produce IL-10."/>

Therefore, this critical and extended role of CCR5 in JE raises possible safety concerns regarding the use of CCR5 antagonists in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals who inhabit regions in which both HIV and flaviviruses, such as JEV and West Nile virus, are endemic.">
