Among patients with ARTIs, RSV accounted for 18.7% (95% confidence interval CI 17.1-20.5%). The prevalence of RSV was highest in infants (26.5%, 95% CI 23.7-29.5%) and lowest in those aged â‰¥16 years (2.8%, 95% CI 1.3-6.1). A higher prevalence of RSV was seen in inpatients (22%, 95% CI 19.9-24.2%) than in outpatients (14%, 95% CI 9.6-19.9%). RSV type A accounted for 63.1% (95% CI 52.3-72.8%) of all RSV infections. RSV infections occurred mainly in winter and spring. The most common clinical manifestations were cough, production of sputum, wheezing and fever.">

Our findings are valuable for guiding the selection of appropriate therapies for ARTIs and implementation of preventive measures against RSV infections. Our data further supports the development of a successful RSV vaccine as a high priority."/>
