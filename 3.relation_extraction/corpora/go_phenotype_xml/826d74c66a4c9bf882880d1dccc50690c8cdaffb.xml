HBoV is associated with upper and lower respiratory tract infections and gastroenteritis in children. Little is known about the seroepidemiology of HBoV in populations in the Caribbean.">

Seroprevalence of HBoV was highest in those $2 years old. The seroepidemiological profile suggests that most children are exposed to HBoV during the first two years of life in Jamaica."/>
