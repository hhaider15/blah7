For each overdispersion treatment, 500 simulated 39-week time series were generated from the stochastic model variant. The basic reproduction number was set to R 0 = 1.4; the incubation and infectious periods were fixed as in Table B1 ; the assumed population size was taken to be that of the Republic of Guinea. We assumed a reporting probability of ρ = 0.2 and that, at outbreak initiation, 10 individuals were infected. This set of parameter values yields a sample mean simulation visually comparable to the WHO data from Guinea, which display initally slow growth in the number of cases and later acceleration.">

All other model parameters were fixed at their true values. Parameter estimation was accomplished using the trajectory matching algorithm (traj.match) from the R package pomp (King et al., 2010). We constructed likelihood profiles over R 0 and, from these, obtained maximum likelihood point estimates and likelihood-ratio confidence intervals. The full process of obtaining likelihood profiles on model parameters by trajectory matching took approximately 1.2 hr on a 40-cpu cluster.">

  <chunk id="15a1cb9e790f884e0513e9f0112a909e95a96c67.c3" text="A second simulation study was performed, in which the deterministic variant of the model was fit to cumulative incidence data by ordinary least squares. This common procedure in effect assumes that measurement errors are independent and identically normally distributed. Results of this exercise are shown in Fig. A2 in a form comparable to that of Fig. 1 . As in the results shown in the main text, confidence interval widths are erroneously under-estimated with the result that achieved coverage is far smaller than its nominal value."/>

  <chunk id="15a1cb9e790f884e0513e9f0112a909e95a96c67.c6" text="Model parameters were initially estimated using trajectory matching. As in the simulation study, we initially fitted R 0 , ρ, k and the initial conditions. However, profile likelihoods over ρ were flat, indicating a lack of identifiability in the reporting rate due to a trade-off between this parameter and initial conditions. Accordingly, we fixed ρ = 0.2. The flatness of the likelihood profiles indicates that this assumption has no effect on the quality of fit. All other model parameters were fixed at the known values given in Table B1 ."/>

For each point in the profile, the other parameters and initial conditions were initialized at 40 points according to a latin hypersquare (Sobol') design. In all, the trajectory matching calculations required approximately 21 cpu hr of computation. Full details of the trajectory matching codes are provided in the Supplementary Material.
