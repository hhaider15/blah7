To date, HEV infections can only be treated with ribavirin (RBV). Major drawbacks of this therapy are that RBV is not approved for administration to pregnant women and that the virus can acquire mutations, which render the intra-host population less sensitive or even resistant to RBV. One of the proposed modes of action of RBV is a direct mutagenic effect on viral genomes, inducing mismatches and subsequent nucleotide substitutions. These transition events can drive the already error-prone viral replication beyond an error threshold, causing viral population extinction. In contrast, the expanded heterogeneous viral population can facilitate selection of mutant viruses with enhanced replication fitness. Emergence of these mutant viruses can lead to therapeutic failure. Consequently, the onset of RBV treatment in chronically HEV-infected individuals can result in two divergent outcomes: viral extinction versus selection of fitness-enhanced viruses. Following an overview of RNA viruses treated with RBV in clinics and a summary of the different antiviral modes of action of this drug, we focus on the mutagenic effect of RBV on HEV intrahost populations, and how HEV is able to overcome lethal mutagenesis.">

Progression to chronicity is generally described for pregnant women and immunosuppressed individuals, such as patients recovering form solid organ transplantation [7] . Data for HIV-coinfected patients are contradictory and still under discussion, as extensively reviewed by Debes et al. [8, 9] . According to the World Health Organization (WHO), each year more than 20 million individuals are newly infected with the HEV [10]. With more than three million symptomatic cases of HEV infection reported worldwide each year and about 70,000 HEV-related deaths [6], HEV must be reconsidered to be a major global health burden, with appropriate resources redirected toward effective control and eventual eradication [11, 12] . Recently, studies reporting extrahepatic manifestations of HEV have accumulated, detailing potential connections between HEV infection and neurological disorders, including Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] .">
