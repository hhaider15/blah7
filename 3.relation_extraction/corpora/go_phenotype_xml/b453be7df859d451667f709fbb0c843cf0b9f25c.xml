  <chunk id="b453be7df859d451667f709fbb0c843cf0b9f25c.c1" text="Excessive activities of cysteinyl cathepsins (CysCts) contribute to the progress of many diseases; however, therapeutic inhibition has been problematic. Zn 21 is a natural inhibitor of proteases with CysHis dyads or CysHis(Xaa) triads. Biguanide forms bidentate metal complexes through the two imino nitrogens. Here, it is discussed that phenformin (phenylethyl biguanide) is a model for recruitment of endogenous Zn 21 to inhibit CysHis/CysHis(X) peptidolysis. Phenformin is a Zn 21 -interactive, anti-proteolytic agent in bioassay of living tissue. Benzoyl-Larginine amide (BAA) is a classical substrate of papain-like proteases; the amide bond is scissile. In this review, the structures of BAA and the phenformin-Zn 21 complex were compared in silico. Their chemistry and dimensions are discussed in light of the active sites of papain-like proteases. The phenyl moieties of both structures bind to the ''S2'' sub-"/>
