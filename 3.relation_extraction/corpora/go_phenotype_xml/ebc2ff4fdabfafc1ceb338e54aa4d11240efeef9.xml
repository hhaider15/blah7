The present study evaluated the protective effect of intranasal PPRV linage 1 and bacterine vaccinations.">

The goats were observed for 3 weeks post-vaccination before comingled with a known infected WAD goat with apparent clinical signs of peste des petits ruminants and further observed clinically for 5 weeks post-infection (PI). Blood samples were taken for hematology while sera were assayed for antioxidants (glutathione peroxidase, glutathione transferase, and superoxide dismutase) activities and pro-oxidants (malondialdehyde content, reduced glutathione, hydrogen peroxide generation , and myeloperoxidase) using spectrophotometric methods. Data were subjected to parametric statistics at Î±=0.05 using GraphPad Prism version 21.">

Two unvaccinated goats were weak and euthanized at 13 and 28 days PI. The goats vaccinated with PPRV and Mh showed better response clinically and biochemically.">
