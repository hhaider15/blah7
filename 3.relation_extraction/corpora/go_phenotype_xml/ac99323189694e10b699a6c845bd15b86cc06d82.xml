  <chunk id="ac99323189694e10b699a6c845bd15b86cc06d82.c1" text="Plant pathogen detection systems have been useful tools to monitor inoculum presence and initiate management schedules. More recently, a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay was successfully designed for field use in the grape powdery mildew pathosystem; however, false negatives or false positives were prevalent in grower-conducted assays due to the difficulty in perceiving the magnesium pyrophosphate precipitate at low DNA concentrations. A quantitative LAMP (qLAMP) assay using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based probe was assessed by grape growers in the Willamette Valley of Oregon. Custom impaction spore samplers were placed at a research vineyard and six commercial vineyard locations, and were tested bi-weekly by the lab and by growers. Growerconducted qLAMP assays used a beta-version of the Smart-DART handheld LAMP reaction devices (Diagenetix, Inc., Honolulu, HI, USA), connected to Android 4.4 enabled, Bluetooth-capable Nexus 7 tablets for output. Quantification by a quantitative PCR assay was assumed correct to compare the lab and grower qLAMP assay quantification. Growers were able to conduct and interpret qLAMP results; however, the Erysiphe necator inoculum quantification was unreliable using the beta-Smart-DART devices. The qLAMP assay developed was sensitive to one spore in early testing of the assay, but decreased to &gt;20 spores by the end of the trial. The qLAMP assay is not likely a suitable management tool for grape powdery mildew due to losses in sensitivity and decreasing costs and portability for other, more reliable molecular tools."/>
