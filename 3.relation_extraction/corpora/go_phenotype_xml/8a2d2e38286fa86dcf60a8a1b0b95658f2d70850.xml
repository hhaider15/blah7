We retrospectively evaluated the use of recent, short, historical time-series for recognizing the onset of community outbreaks of respiratory tract infections (RTIs).">

  <chunk id="8a2d2e38286fa86dcf60a8a1b0b95658f2d70850.c2" text="The data used referred to the proportion of diagnoses for upper or lower RTIs to total diagnoses for house-call visits, performed by a private network of medical specialists (SOS Doctors) in the metropolitan area of Athens, Greece, between January 01, 2000 and October 12, 2008. The reference standard classification of the observations was obtained by generating epidemic thresholds after analyzing the full 9-year period. We evaluated two different alert generating methods [simple regression and cumulative sum (CUSUM), respectively], under a range of input parameters, using data for the previous running 4-6 week period. These methods were applied if the previous weeks contained non-aberrant observations."/>

The best results (sensitivity, specificity) for simple regression and CUSUM models for upper RTIs were (1.00, 0.82) and (0.94, 0.93) respectively. Corresponding results for lower RTIs were (1.00, 0.80) and (0.93, 0.91) respectively."/>

Such surveillance models could be particularly useful when a large historical database is either unavailable or inaccurate and, thus, traditional methods are not optimal."/>
