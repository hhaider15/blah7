In WT mice, IFN-γ was first produced in the CNS by natural killer cells and then by CD4 + and CD8 + T cells. Mice with impaired IFN-γ signaling initiated clearance of viral RNA earlier than WT mice associated with CNS entry of more granzyme B-producing CD8 + T cells. However, these mice established fewer CD8 + tissue-resident memory T (T RM ) cells and were more likely to experience reactivation of viral RNA synthesis late after infection. Therefore, IFN-γ suppresses the local development of granzyme B-expressing CD8 + T cells and slows viral RNA clearance but promotes CD8 + T RM cell establishment.">

The IFN-γ receptor is a heterotetramer of ligand-binding IFN-γR1 and signaling IFN-γR2 expressed on many cell types, including neurons [15] . IFN-γ binding to its receptor triggers a Jak/Stat signaling pathway that can induce expression of over 200 ISGs, some of which have direct antiviral activity, while others modulate the immune response [15] [16] [17] . IFN-γ is particularly important for clearance of infectious virus from spinal cord neurons [7] . IFN-γ-induced immunomodulatory effects include immune cell activation, trafficking, and differentiation, as well as more direct intracellular antiviral activities [18] .">

Previous studies have shown that mice with impaired IFN-γ signaling produce lower levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the CNS, resulting in better food intake and less weight loss than their WT counterparts, but entry of fewer antibody-secreting cells, slower clearance of infectious virus and more reactivation of infectious virus 18 to 21 days after infection [6] [7] [8] [9] . In the current study, we have further defined the role of IFN-γ by analyzing the in vitro role of IFN-γ in regulating SINV replication and clearance in differentiated neurons, identifying the sources of IFN-γ in the CNS of SINV-infected mice, and determining its role in clearance of SINV RNA and modulation of the T cell response. We show that IFN-γ induced an antiviral response in neurons in vitro with enhanced viral RNA clearance. In SINV-infected WT mice, IFN-γ was produced in the CNS by NK cells and T cells and inhibited development of the local CD8 + T cell response, resulting in slower clearance of viral RNA than in Ifng −/− and Ifngr1 −/− mice. Understanding how the immune response is able to clear both infectious virus and viral RNA while simultaneously controlling reactivation may inform development of interventions.">
