Differences in codon usage patterns among genes reflect variations in local base compositional biases and the intensity of natural selection. Recently, there have been several reports related to codon usage in fungi, but little is known about codon usage bias in Epichloë endophytes. The present study aimed to assess codon usage patterns and biases in 4870 sequences from Epichloë festucae, which may be helpful in revealing the constraint factors such as mutation or selection pressure and improving the bioreactor on the cloning, expression, and characterization of some special genes. The GC content with 56.41% is higher than the AT content (43.59%) in E. festucae. The results of neutrality and effective number of codons plot analyses showed that both mutational bias and natural selection play roles in shaping codon usage in this species. We found that gene length is strongly correlated with codon usage and may contribute to the codon usage patterns observed in genes. Nucleotide composition and gene expression levels also shape codon usage bias in E. festucae. E. festucae exhibits codon usage bias based on the relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) values of 61 sense codons, with 25 codons showing an RSCU larger than 1. In addition, we identified 27 optimal codons that end in a G or C.">

However, little is known about codon usage bias in Epichloë endophytes, a group of clavicipitaceous fungi (Clavicipitaceae, Ascomycota) that live in systemic symbioses with cool-season grasses of the subfamily Pooideae [15, 16] . This mutualistic symbiotic association confers on the host a number of bioprotective benefits by producing secondary fungal metabolites that alter host metabolism [17] . While Epichloë endophytes provide many benefits for their hosts, including both abiotic and biotic factors [18, 19] , as well as enhanced growth [20, 21] , the alkaloids produced by the symbiosis can cause health problems for grazing livestock [22] . E. festucae is a biotrophic fungus that systemically colonizes the aerial tissues of the cool-season grasses Festuca, Lolium, and Koeleria spp. to form a highly structured symbiotic hyphal network [23] [24] [25] [26] . E. festucae has been adopted as the model experimental system for the study of the cellular mechanisms underlying endophyte-grass symbiotic interactions [24, 26] . Recently, the genome sequences of two E. festucae strains were released [27] . In this study, we analyzed the codon usage bias of E. festucae and its relationship with other genome features. Our results lay the groundwork for analyses of genetic evolution in E. festucae.">
