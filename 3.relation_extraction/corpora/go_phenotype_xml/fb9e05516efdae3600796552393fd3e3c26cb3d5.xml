The aim of this study was to study the influence of serum UA levels on mortality in patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. Methods: Data on 492 patients from a single peritoneal dialysis unit were retrospectively analyzed. The mean age of the patients was 53.5 Â± 15.3 years, with 52% being female (n = 255). The concomitant comorbidities at the start of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) encompassed diabetes mellitus (n = 179, 34.6%), hypertension (n = 419, 85.2%), and cardiovascular disease (n = 186, 37.9%). The study cohort was divided into sex-specific tertiles according to baseline UA level. A Cox proportional hazard model was used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) of all-cause, cardiovascular, and infection-associated mortality with adjustments for demographic and laboratory data, medications, and comorbidities. Results: Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that, using UA tertile 1 as the reference, the adjusted HR of all-cause, cardiovascular, and infection-associated mortality for tertile 3 was 0.4 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.24-0.68, p = 0.001), 0.4 (95% CI 0.2-0.81, p = 0.01), and 0.47 (95% CI 0.19-1.08, p = 0.1). In the fully adjusted model, the adjusted HRs of all-cause, cardiovascular, and infection-associated mortality for each 1-mg/dL increase in UA level were 0.84 (95% CI, 0.69-0.9, p = 0.07), 0.79 (95% CI, 0.61-1.01, p = 0.06), and 0.79 (95% CI, 0.48-1.21, p = 0.32) for men and 0.57 (95% CI, 0.44-0.73, p &lt; 0.001), 0.6 (95% CI, 0.41-0.87, p = 0.006), and 0.41 (95% CI, 0.26-0.6, p &lt; 0.001) for women, respectively. Conclusions: Higher UA levels are associated with lower risks of all-cause, cardiovascular and infection-associated mortality in women treated with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.">
