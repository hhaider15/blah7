Despite some difficulties, current forensic genetics is progressively incorporating the analysis of nonhuman genetic material to a greater extent. The analysis of this material-including other animal species, plants, or microorganisms-is now broadly used, providing ancillary evidence in criminalistics in cases such as animal attacks, trafficking of species, bioterrorism and biocrimes, and identification of fraudulent food composition, among many others. Here, we explore how nonhuman forensic genetics is being revolutionized by the increasing variety of genetic markers, the establishment of faster, less error-burdened and cheaper sequencing technologies, and the emergence and improvement of models, methods, and bioinformatics facilities.

The genetic information obtained is then compared with other genetic information (i.e., derived from reliable databases [e.g., 10] or reference sample[s]) considering statistical analyses. The experimental workflow ends with a report describing the technical procedures applied and the answers to the question(s) of the request."/>

Traditionally, PCR-based methodologies designed to generate short amplicons, such as Rapid Amplification of Random DNA (RAPD) [11], Inter Simple Sequence Repeats (ISSR) [12], and Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) [13], were applied in NHFG analyses. Two relevant forensic cases applying RADP are the analysis of Fig 1. Most relevant applications of the zoology, botany, microbiology, and food analysis and traceability sciences to NHFG. Diverse examples for each of these applications are shown in S1 Table and S2 Table ( see also S1 Text) and described in the section applications of NHFG. NHFG, nonhuman forensic genetics. plant (seed pods) DNA in a murder case in Phoenix [14], and the analysis of the outbreak of human anthrax occurred in Sverdlovsk (Ekaterinburg, Russia) [15]."/>

The development of reduced-size STR amplicons (miniSTRs) can provide easy PCR amplification of degraded DNA samples, better estimation of mutation rates and allele frequencies, and construction of allelic ladders for accurate classification of alleles.

The process starts with the evaluation of the case and sample collection (green boxes). The procedure continues in the laboratory, where the DNA is extracted from the biological source material and analyzed according to an appropriate protocol (blue boxes). The genetic information is then compared with reference databases and the results are described in a written report (red boxes)."/>
