  <chunk id="af28c7f2e54f09c2ee5ea579d8646768a3be25c6.c3" text="Based on BLASTx and BLASTn analyses, numerous read and contig sequences from pooled bat samples were identified as taxonomically related to families of viruses infecting invertebrates, mostly the Polydnaviridae, Baculoviridae, Dicistroviridae and Nodaviridae. For the last two of these families, we were able to identify and confirm the presence of putative new insect viruses, in bat specimens b2 (Pipistrellus pipistrellus) and b7 (Eptesicus serotinus), respectively."/>
