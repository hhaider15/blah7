  <chunk id="66fb607e8ee0e7b13f1abaedf0ed42451c8924a2.c1" text="Background Human adenovirus 55 (HAdV-55) has caused recent outbreaks of acute respiratory disease (ARD) among adults and military trainees. The active surveillance for HAdV infections was sparse in China, and current knowledge on the HAdV-type distributions and its molecular evolution is lacking.">

The genotype of HAdV isolates were determined by sequencing the partial hexon and fiber genes. Whole genome sequences of HAdV-55 were obtained for molecular evolution analysis."/>
  <chunk id="66fb607e8ee0e7b13f1abaedf0ed42451c8924a2.c4" text="Results About 191 (8Á55%) HAdV were detected in 2234 children, including 92 (48Á2%) with HAdV-7, 72 (37Á7%) with HAdV-3, 6 (3Á1%) with HAdV-55, 5 (2Á6%) with HAdV-5, 4 (2Á1%) with HAdV-1, 1 (0Á5%) with HAdV-2, and 11(5Á8%) with untyped HAdV. Four of these children developed pneumonia, two of whom were diagnosed with severe pneumonia and/or encephalopathy. HAdV-55 isolates clustered with HAdV-11 sequences based on the hexon gene and clustered with HAdV-14 sequences based on the fiber gene and the whole genome. The overall evolutionary rates of hexon gene, fiber gene, and whole genome of HAdV-55 were estimated at 6Á2 9 10 À5 s/s/y, 8Á0 9 10 À5 s/s/y, and 1Á7 9 10 À5 s/ s/y, respectively.">

  <chunk id="66fb607e8ee0e7b13f1abaedf0ed42451c8924a2.c5" text="Conclusions This study suggested HAdV-55 as an emerging infectious disease pathogen has conserved genetic structure and is closely related to each other. Further molecular investigation based on HAdV-55 of wider origin might facilitate understanding its diversity, dissemination, and transmission in China."/>
