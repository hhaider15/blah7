  <chunk id="fcc20c80be8954f1682993217bbd2a78659a16f1.c1" text="The Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV), first identified in Saudi Arabia, is an emerging zoonotic pathogen that causes severe acute respiratory illness in humans with a high fatality rate. Since its emergence, MERS-CoV continues to spread to countries outside of the Arabian Peninsula and gives rise to sporadic human infections following the entry of infected individuals to other countries, which can precipitate outbreaks similar to the one that occurred in South Korea in 2015. Current therapeutics against MERS-CoV infection have primarily been adapted from previous drugs used for the treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome. In search of new potential drug candidates, we screened a library composed of 2334 clinically approved drugs and pharmacologically active compounds. The drug saracatinib, a potent inhibitor of Src-family of tyrosine kinases (SFK), was identified as an inhibitor of MERS-CoV replication in vitro. Our results suggest that saracatinib potently inhibits MERS-CoV at the early stages of the viral life cycle in Huh-7 cells, possibly through the suppression of SFK signaling pathways. Furthermore, saracatinib exhibited a synergistic effect with gemcitabine, an anticancer drug with antiviral activity against several RNA viruses. These data indicate that saracatinib alone or in combination with gemcitabine can provide a new therapeutic option for the treatment of MERS-CoV infection.">

The clinical features of MERS-CoV infection in humans range from asymptomatic to severe lower respiratory tract infections with the potential development of acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, and multiorgan failure resulting in death [9, 10] . Due to high morbidity and mortality rates, therapeutic options of MERS-CoV were immediately adapted from previous reports of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) therapies including the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, corticosteroids, interferons, ribavirin, lopinavir-ritonavir, and/or mycophenolate mofetil, but none of them were effective in randomized controlled trials [3, 11] . Therefore, the rapid discovery of effective prophylactic or therapeutic measures to prevent or treat MERS is urgently needed.">

From the results, we identified saracatinib, a potent inhibitor of the Src-family of tyrosine kinases (SFKs), as an inhibitor of MERS-CoV as well as other members of the Coronaviridae family. We evaluated the antiviral activity of saracatinib and found that it suppressed the early stages of the MERS-CoV life cycle in Huh-7 cells through a possible suppression of the SFK signaling pathways. Furthermore, we assessed the combined effect of saracatinib with another chemotherapeutic agent, gemcitabine, in Huh-7 cells. Enhanced effects with lower toxicity were observed in a combination of these two drugs. Data presented in this study suggest that saracatinib alone or in combination with other agents can provide a new therapeutic option for the treatment of MERS-CoV infection.">
