  <chunk id="a4cfc3e2cc8c3a69d8a6384aa77b9a9ff7a51dd7.c1" text="The rising prevalence of arthritogenic alphavirus infections, including chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and Ross River virus (RRV), and the lack of antiviral treatments highlight the potential threat of a global alphavirus pandemic. The immune responses underlying alphavirus virulence remain enigmatic. We found that pentraxin 3 (PTX3) was highly expressed in CHIKV and RRV patients during acute disease. Overt expression of PTX3 in CHIKV patients was associated with increased viral load and disease severity. PTX3-deficient (PTX3 -/-) mice acutely infected with RRV exhibited delayed disease progression and rapid recovery through diminished inflammatory responses and viral replication. Furthermore, binding of the N-terminal domain of PTX3 to RRV facilitated viral entry and replication. Thus, our study demonstrates the pivotal role of PTX3 in shaping alphavirus-triggered immunity and disease and provides new insights into alphavirus pathogenesis.">

The rising prevalence of alphavirus infections and, critically, the lack of therapeutic treatments warrant urgent attention to elucidate the innate immune responses elicited, which serves as the first line of host defense against alphavirus. Ironically, robust innate immune responses have been associated with both protective and pathogenic outcomes. Here, we identified PTX3 as an innate protein involved in acute CHIKV and RRV infection in humans. Using an established acute PLOS Pathogens |">
