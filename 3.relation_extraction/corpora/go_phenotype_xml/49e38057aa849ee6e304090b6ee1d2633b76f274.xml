  <chunk id="49e38057aa849ee6e304090b6ee1d2633b76f274.c1" text="Chikungunya virus has emerged as one of the most important global arboviral threats over the last decade. Inspite of large scale morbidity, with long lasting polyarthralgia, so far no licensed vaccine or antiviral is available. CHIKV nsP2 protease is crucial for processing of viral nonstructural polypeptide precursor to release enzymes required for viral replication, thus making it a promising drug target. In this study, high cell density cultivation (HCDC) of Escherichia coli in batch process was carried out to produce rCHIKV nsP2pro in a cost-effective manner. The purified nsP2pro and fluorogenic peptide substrate have been adapted for fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) based high throughput screening (HTS) assay with Z' value and CV of 0.67 ± 0.054 and &lt;10% respectively. We used this cell free HTS system to screen panel of metal ions and its conjugate which revealed zinc acetate as a potential candidate, which was further found to inhibit CHIKV in Vero cells. Scale-up process has not been previously reported for any of the arboviral nonstructural enzymes. The successful scale-up method for viral protease together with a HTS assay could lead to the development of industrial level large-scale screening platform for identification of protease inhibitors against emerging and re-emerging viruses."/>

Though CHIKV was isolated almost five decades ago, however the last decade witnessed numerous major outbreaks spanning different continents. It is now reported from both old and new world and is recognized as a global public health concern. The incursion of African genotype into Asia and Asian genotype into Americas led to massive unprecedented outbreaks in naïve population 2,3 . CHIKV infection in human may last for 1-10 days and the clinical spectrum ranges from acute infection to severe complications 4-7 . The higher number of severe cases indicates an urgent need to develop safe and effective medical countermeasures against CHIKV. Currently there is no licensed vaccine or therapeutics available against CHIKV.">

CHIKV has a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome which encodes two polyproteins viz non-structural and structural. During viral replication, non-structural polyprotein is processed into four nonstructural proteins (nsP1, nsP2, nsP3, and nsP4) responsible for viral replication and evasion from the host defence mechanisms. In addition structural polyprotein is processed into various proteins (C, E3, E2, 6K, E1) that are involved in viral particle assembly 9 . Currently, targeting viral enzymes that are crucial for viral replication is believed to be an attractive strategy for development of">
