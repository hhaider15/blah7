  <chunk id="a81fbdb3bc7956412cd686e72115f4cddf1090be.c1" text="Dendritic cells (DCs) are recognized as highly potent antigen-presenting cells that are able to stimulate cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses with antitumor activity. Consequently, DCs have been explored as cellular vaccines in cancer immunotherapy. To that end, DCs are modified with tumor antigens to enable presentation of antigen-derived peptides to CTLs. In this review we discuss the use of viral vectors for in situ modification of DCs, focusing on their clinical applications as anticancer vaccines. Among the viral vectors discussed are those derived from viruses belonging to the families of the Poxviridae, Adenoviridae, Retroviridae, Togaviridae, Paramyxoviridae, and Rhabdoviridae. We will further shed light on how the combination of viral vector-based vaccination with T-cell supporting strategies will bring this strategy to the next level.">

  <chunk id="a81fbdb3bc7956412cd686e72115f4cddf1090be.c2" text="Since their discovery in 1973, it was clear that dendritic cells (DCs) stood out above the immune cell pack (1, 2). They are morphologically distinct from all other immune cell types and are gifted with an unparalleled capacity to take up, process and present self and foreign antigens to both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells. DCs are critical intermediaries between the innate and adaptive immune systems, as they stimulate, regulate, and shape both immunity and tolerance in all its disguises. Ralph Steinmann, who discovered these cells, was awarded the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 2011, because the discovery of DCs changed medicine (3)."/>
  <chunk id="a81fbdb3bc7956412cd686e72115f4cddf1090be.c3" text="Dendritic cells in both humans and mice represent a population of at least four different subtypes with distinct phenotypical and functional characteristics (4-7). These subsets are: plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs), two subsets of conventional DCs (cDC1 and cDC2), and inflammatory DCs. The latter represent a monocyte-derived subset that appears during inflammatory responses (Table 1) ."/>

The group of Prof. Nir Hacohen identified pDCs next to cDC progenitor-derived cDC1 (Clec9A + ) and two types of CD1c + cDC2, of which one can also be derived from CD14 + DCs. Furthermore they found a CD141 − CD1c − CD11c + DC subset derived from CD16 + monocytes and an AXL + Siglec6 + subset (8). Future research will have to unravel a possible murine representative for the human cDC2 and AXL + Siglec6 + DC subset. Also, Langerhans cells have been considered an important DC subset for vaccination as they are localized in the epidermis (HLA-DR + CD11c + CD1a + CD207 + ). However, recent evidence suggests that they are related to macrophages, another antigen-presenting cell (APC) type with potential antitumor activity (9).">
