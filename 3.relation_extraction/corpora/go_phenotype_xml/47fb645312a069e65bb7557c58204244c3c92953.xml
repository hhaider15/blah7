  <chunk id="47fb645312a069e65bb7557c58204244c3c92953.c1" text="Background: Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (APP) is one of the most important swine pathogens worldwide. Identification and characterization of novel antigenic APP vaccine candidates are underway. In the present study, we use an immunoproteomic approach to identify APP protein antigens that may elicit an immune response in serotype 1 naturally infected swine and serotype 1 virulent strain S259-immunized rabbits.">

Western blot analysis revealed 21 immunoreactive protein spots separated in the pH 4-7 range and 4 spots in the pH 7-11 range with the convalescent sera from swine; we found 5 immunoreactive protein spots that separated in the pH 4-7 range and 2 in the pH 7-11 range with hyperimmune sera from S259-immunized rabbits. The proteins included the known antigens ApxIIA, protective surface antigen D15, outer membrane proteins P5, subunit NqrA. The remaining antigens are being reported as immunoreactive proteins in APP for the first time, to our knowledge. Conclusions: We identified a total of 42 immunoreactive proteins of the APP serotype 1 virulent strain S259 which represented 32 different proteins, including some novel immunoreactive factors which could be researched as vaccine candidates.">
