  <chunk id="11022b299f98034d0060f9c036333f1b9024d7a1.c1" text="Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) spread rapidly after being diagnosed in the USA in April 2013. In this study we assessed whether PEDV could become airborne and if so, whether the virus was infectious. Air samples were collected both from a room containing experimentally infected pigs and at various distances from the outside of swine farms experiencing acute PEDV outbreaks. Results indicated presence of infectious PEDV in the air from experimentally infected pigs and genetic material of PEDV was detected up to 10 miles downwind from naturally infected farms. Airborne transmission should be considered as a potential route for PEDV dissemination.">
