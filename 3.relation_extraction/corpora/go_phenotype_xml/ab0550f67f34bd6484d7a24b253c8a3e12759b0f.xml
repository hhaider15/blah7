We characterize the transmissibility of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (hereafter pH1N1) in South Africa during 2009 by estimating the serial interval (SI), the initial effective reproductive number (initial R t ) and the temporal variation of R t ."/>

Whenever date of symptom onset is missing, we estimate it from the date of specimen collection using a multiple imputation approach repeated 100 times for each missing value. We apply a likelihood-based method (method 1) for simultaneous estimation of initial R t and the SI; estimate initial R t from SI distributions established from prior field studies (method 2); and the Wallinga and Teunis method (method 3) to model the temporal variation of R t .">

During the period of exponential growth of the epidemic (June 21 to August 3, 2009), we simultaneously estimate a mean R t of 1.47 (95% CI: 1.30-1.72) and mean SI of 2.78 days (95% CI: 1.80-3.75) (method 1). Field studies found a mean SI of 2.3 days between primary cases and laboratoryconfirmed secondary cases, and 2.7 days when considering both suspected and confirmed secondary cases. Incorporating the SI estimate from field studies using laboratory-confirmed cases, we found an initial R t of 1.43 (95% CI: 1.38-1.49) (method 2). The mean R t peaked at 2.91 (95% CI: 0.85-2.91) on June 21, as the epidemic commenced, and R t .1 was sustained until August 22 (method 3).">
