Efficacy of vaccines and antivirals to treat human CCHFV infections remains limited and controversial. Research into pathology and underlying molecular mechanisms of CCHFV and other nairoviruses is limited. Significant progress has been made in our understanding of CCHFV replication and pathogenesis in the past decade. Here we review the most recent molecular advances in CCHFV-related research, and provide perspectives on future research.">

Although research on CCHFV is limited, there have been significant recent advances in CCHFV research. These include modern molecular tools and in vivo disease models that offer opportunities for substantial progress in the field, and further development of therapeutics and vaccines. In this article, we summarize current knowledge of CCHFV genome replication, viral protein processing and function, and the development of reverses genetic systems. We also highlight areas of importance for future research.">

CCHFV is characterized by a tripartite RNA genome of negative polarity (Figure 1) , and by tick-borne maintenance and transmission. Complementary non-coding regions (NCRs) are present at the 5 1 and 3 1 termini of the small (S), medium (M), and large (L) segments of CCHFV and contribute to the circular appearance of the bunyavirus genomes [24] . The nine terminal nucleotides (5 1 -UCUCAAAGA and 3 1 -AGAGUUUCU) are conserved between nairoviruses, and serve as viral promoter regions. The NCRs are necessary for the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp or L protein) to bind and initiate transcription and/or replication of the viral genome [25] [26] [27] . Although the complete NCRs sequences differ between viral segments, each is capable of initiating encapsidation, transcription, replication and packaging of the genomes into nascent virions.">

  <chunk id="dc69e220d40597887fac3851a1601408fe7bf568.c5" text="Until recently, all three segments of CCHFV were believed to each encode a single protein. However, a second protein, the non-structural S (NS S ), is encoded in the S segment in the opposite orientation relative to the nucleoprotein (NP) gene, indicating that CCHFV might be considered an ambisense virus (Figure 2) [28]. However, the ambisense coding in CCHFV involves overlapping coding regions. This differs from ambisense coding in bunyaviruses and arenaviruses where the viral proteins are encoded in opposite orientation, and separated by an intergenic region that serves as a transcription termination signal [29, 30] . In contrast to the S segment (~1.6 kb), that is comparable in size to other bunyaviruses, the M (~5.4 kb) and L (~12.1 kb) segments of CCHFV are significantly larger than those of other bunyaviruses, and contain a single gene encoding the glycoprotein precursor (GPC) and the L protein, respectively."/>

The genomic RNPs are packaged into viral particles by acquiring a lipid envelope and the surface glycoproteins Gn and Gc [31] (Figure 1 ). Electron microscopy studies of nairoviruses report spherical particles of relatively uniform size with a diameter of~90-100 nm with small (&lt;10 nm) spike-like projections from the surface of the particle [27, [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] . Further characterization of the precise arrangement of the surface glycoproteins will require more refined methods such as cryo-electron microscopy.">
