The 624/I and Q1 genotypes, now recognized to be part of the GI-16 lineage, represent an excellent example of the practical consequences of IBV molecular epidemiology limited knowledge. In fact, being their common origin unrecognized for a long time, independent epidemiological pictures were drawn for the two genotypes. To fix this misinterpretation, the present study reconstructs the history, population dynamics and spreading patterns of GI-16 lineage as a whole using a phylodynamic approach. A collection of worldwide available hypervariable region 1 and 2 (HVR12) and 3 (HVR3) sequences of the S1 protein was analysed together with 258 HVR3 sequences obtained from samples collected in Italy (the country where this genotype was initially identified) since 1963. The results demonstrate that after its emergence at the beginning of the XX century, GI-16 was able to persist until present days in Italy. Approximately in the late 1980s, it migrated to Asia, which became the main nucleus for further spreading to Middle East, Europe and especially South America, likely through multiple introduction events. A remarkable among-country diffusion was also demonstrated in Asia and South America. Interestingly, although most of the recent Italian GI-16 strains originated from ancestral viruses detected in the same country, a couple were closely related to Chinese ones, supporting a backward viral flow from China to Italy. Besides to the specific case-study results, this work highlights the misconceptions that originate from the lack of a unified nomenclature and poor molecular epidemiology data generation and sharing. This shortcoming appears particularly relevant since the described scenario could likely be shared by many other IBV genotypes and pathogens in general.">

The viral genome is about 27 Kb long and encodes for different proteins, such as the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), numerous accessory and regulatory proteins and the Spike, Envelope, Membrane, and Nucleocapsid structural proteins [1] . IBV currently represents one of the most relevant diseases of poultry farming, being responsible for respiratory signs, reproductive disorders and relevant mortality, particularly in presence of nephropathogenic strains or secondary infections [2] . Similarly to other RNA viruses, it is characterized by high evolutionary and recombination rates, which drive the rapid evolution of this pathogen and lead to a remarkable genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity [3] . The Spike protein, further processed in the S1 and S2 sub-units, is by far the most studied viral protein because of its relevance in viral life-cycle and host interaction. Besides being involved in viral attachment and viral-host membranes fusion, it is also the main target of the host neutralizing immune response [1, 4] . Its remarkable variability has several implications, the most practical one being the poor cross protection among different viral strains and genotypes [5] , which severely hinders the infection and disease control through vaccination. Additionally, the genetic variability has also complicated the viral classification, leading to the proposal of a multitude of genotypes based on specific research studies or local investigations, in absence of shared criteria. Although it could appear a mere nomenclature issue, this state of affairs had astonishing implications impeding or confusing the proper understanding of IBV molecular epidemiology.">

Until then, the two genotypes had been named (and considered) independent: the 624/I was first reported in Italy in 1993 [8] , and thereafter in Slovenia [9], Poland [10], and Russia [11] . Moreover, retrospective studies demonstrated its wide circulation in Italy since the early 1960s [12] , where it remained the most prevalent genotype for more than a decade. However, from the 1990s, its detection and reporting became sporadic or absent. At the same time, in 1996, a new IBV strain (later renamed Q1) was identified in animals affected by proventriculitis [13] in China and thereafter in other Asian [14, 15], Middle Eastern [16, 17] , South American [18, 19] and European countries [7, [20] [21] [22] . Remarkably, not recognizing the relationship between these strains, a new spread from Asia was supposed, similarly what was proven for the GI-19 lineage (QX genotype) [23] . Data recently published by Laconi et al. [24] strongly suggest a common origin between the 624I and Q1 genotypes, however the actual origin and dispersal pattern of GI-16 lineage could not be inferred confidently.">
