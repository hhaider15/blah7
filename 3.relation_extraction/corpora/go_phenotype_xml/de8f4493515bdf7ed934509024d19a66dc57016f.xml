A total of 25 cases were reported from the first wave of the epidemic until April 8, 2014. The fatality rate was much higher than in previous reports. The objective of the current work was to describe the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of A (H7N9) patients in Guangzhou and explore possible reasons for the high fatality rate."/>

Data regarding clinical and laboratory features, treatment, and outcomes were extracted. Results: Of the 25 patients, 84 % (21/25) had one or more underlying diseases. Fifteen patients (60.0 %) developed moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and 14 (56 %) died of the ARDS or multiorgan failure. Patients with longer delay between onset of illness and initiation of oseltamivir treatment were more likely to develop ARDS. Elevated C-creative protein, aspartate aminotransferase, creatine kinase, and lymphocytopenia predicted a higher risk of developing ARDS. Conclusions: The presence of underlying diseases and clinical complications predicted poor clinical outcome. Early oseltamivir treatment was associated with a reduced risk of developing ARDS.">
