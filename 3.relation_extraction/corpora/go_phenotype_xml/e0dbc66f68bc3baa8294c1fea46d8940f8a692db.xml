Subsequently, quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping was performed, and results showed a significant QTL only for females on chromosome 8 at genomic interval 88.61-93.38 Mb (4.77 Mb). Three suggestive QTL were mapped at chromosomes 4, 12 and 13. The four QTL were designated as LWL1-LWL4 referring to liver weight loci 1-4 on chromosomes 8, 4, 12 and 13, respectively.">
