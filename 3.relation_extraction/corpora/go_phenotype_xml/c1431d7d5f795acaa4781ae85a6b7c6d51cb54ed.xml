We aimed to assay the correlation between viral load and clinical characteristics of HBoV and HMPV with LRTI in Changsha, China.">

There was no significant difference between HBoV-and HMPV-positive patients in age (P = .506) or hospitalization duration (P = .280); 24.1% and 18.2% were positive for HBoV and HMPV. HBoV infections peaked in summer (32.2%), and HMPV infections peaked in winter (28.9%). The HBoV-positive patients had a shorter hospitalization duration than the HBoV-negative patients (P = .021), and the HMPV-positive patients had a higher prevalence of fever than the HMPV-negative patients (P = .002). The HBoV viral load was significantly higher among patients aged &lt;1 year (P = .006). The mean HBoV and HMPV viral loads were not significantly different between patients with single infections and coinfections. Patients infected with HBoV only were older than those coinfected with HBoV and other respiratory viruses (P = .005). No significant difference was found in the clinical characteristics of patients infected with HMPV only and those coinfected with HMPV and other respiratory viruses.">
