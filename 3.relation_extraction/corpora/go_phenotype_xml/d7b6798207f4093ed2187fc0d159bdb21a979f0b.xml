  <chunk id="d7b6798207f4093ed2187fc0d159bdb21a979f0b.c1" text="This is an extension of the above study. In here, we determined EBV infection of cells to trigger IFITM1 expression, in vitro. Silencing IFITM1 expression using siRNA specifically lowered gammaherpesvirus infection of cells at a post binding stage of entry. A natural model system to explore the effect of IFITM1 on gammaherpesvirus infection in vivo is infection of BALB/c mice with murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV-68). Priming mice with siRNA specific to IFITM1 significantly lowered MHV-68 titers in the lung specimens compared to priming with (NS)siRNA or PBS. MHV-68 titers were monitored by plaque assay and qPCR. Taken together, for the first time, this study provides insight into the critical role of IFITM1 to promoting in vivo gammaherpesvirus infections.">

KS is characterized by three histological features: angiogenesis, inflammation, and proliferation 2 . KSHV is also associated with two other B cell lymphoproliferative disorders: primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) and multicentric Castlesman disease (MCD) 3 . KSHV belongs to the γ-herpesvirinae subfamily (genus Rhadinovirus) and was first described in 1994 4,5 .">

The initial step in the virus entry process is the reversible step of binding or attachment to the target cells 6 . This step is primarily achieved by KSHV interacting with the ubiquitously expressed cell surface receptor, heparan sulfate (HS) 6,7 . The attachment to cells enables KSHV to interact with entry promoting receptors allowing the virus to eventually enter the cell 8,9 . In a recent study, we determined that interferon (IFN)-induced transmembrane-1 (IFITM1) expression to significantly enhance KSHV infection of human B and endothelial cells 10 . In opposition to this process, over-expression of microRNA (miRNA)-36 (miR-36) significantly lowered expression of IFITM1 and thus the virus entry. We concluded IFITM1 to play a crucial role in promoting early stages of KSHV infection of cells, in vitro.">

There are two genetically and functionally distinct families of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) that have antiviral properties, they are IFN-induced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFIT) and IFITMs. IFITs contribute to an antiviral state against some viruses by binding components of the eIF3 translation initiation complex and inhibiting protein translation 11 . In contrast, IFITMs block viral infection at the entry stage 12 . IFITMs are a double-edged sword when it comes to influencing viral entry; they can also enhance viral entry 13,14 . Interestingly, IFITM1 expression not only enhanced KSHV infection of cells, but also infection of cells with a closely related herpesvirus belonging to the γ-herpesvirinae subfamily, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) 10 .">
