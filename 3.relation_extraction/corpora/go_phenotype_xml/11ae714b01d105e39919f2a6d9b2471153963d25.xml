  <chunk id="11ae714b01d105e39919f2a6d9b2471153963d25.c1" text="Background: Overcrowding, reduced nurse to patient ratio, limited distance between incubators and absence of microbiological surveillance have been shown to promote spread of multidrug-resistant gram-negative organisms (MDRGN) in patients with birthweight &lt; 1500 g. Patients &gt; 1500 g treated on an intermediate care unit are unrepresented in recent literature. We therefore intended to present data obtained from a short-term overcrowded neonatal intermediate care unit (NIMCU) at a level III (international categorization) perinatal center at University Hospital Frankfurt, Germany."/>

  <chunk id="11ae714b01d105e39919f2a6d9b2471153963d25.c3" text="Results: During OV, the number of patients simultaneously treated at the NIMCU increased from 18 to 22, resulting in a reduced bed-to-bed space. Nurse: patient ratio was 4:22 during OV compared to 3:18 during PRAE-OV. Cumulative incidence of MDRGN was 4.7% in OV and 2.4% POST-OV compared to 4.8% to PRAE-OV, respectively, without any significant variations. During OV and POST-OV, septic episodes due to MDRGN were not observed. In one case, potential nosocomial transmission of Enterobacter cloacae resistant to Piperacillin and 3rd/4th generation cephalosporins was observed. Conclusions: Prevention of nosocomial spread of MDRGN in an overcrowded NIMCU is based on staff's diligent training and adequate staffing. Concise microbiological surveillance should be guaranteed to escort through overcrowding periods. In our setting, impact of bed-to-bed distance on MDRGN transmission seemed to be less strong."/>
