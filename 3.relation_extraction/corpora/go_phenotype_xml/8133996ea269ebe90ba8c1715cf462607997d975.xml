Unlike schools in the US, human contacts within Chinese colleges are extremely clustered, partly due to the highly organized lifestyle of Chinese college students. Simulations of influenza spreading across real contact networks are in good accordance with real influenza records; however, epidemic simulations across idealized scale-free or small-world networks show considerable overestimation of disease prevalence, thus challenging the widely-applied idealized human contact models in epidemiology. Furthermore, the special contact pattern within Chinese colleges results in disease spreading patterns distinct from those of the US schools. Remarkably, class cancelation, though simple, shows a mitigating power equal to quarantine/vaccination applied on ~25% of college students, which quantitatively explains its success in Chinese colleges during the SARS period. Our findings greatly facilitate reliable prediction of epidemic prevalence, and thus should help establishing effective strategies for respiratory infectious diseases control."/>

For example, influenza, a highly infectious disease, led to an estimated 250,000~500,000 deaths worldwide each year 2 . In comparison, tuberculosis, although spreading relatively slowly, was reported to cause more than 1.3 million deaths in 2012 3 . However, predicting the prevalence of respiratory infectious diseases and establishing effective control strategies remain fundamental challenges, partly due to the lack of understanding on the principles of disease spread."/>
  <chunk id="8133996ea269ebe90ba8c1715cf462607997d975.c3" text="Unraveling the principles of how respiratory infectious diseases spread requires a detailed understanding of human contact networks. Briefly, a human contact network consists of nodes representing individuals, as well as edges representing close proximity interactions (CPIs) among individuals 4 . Respiratory infectious diseases are predominantly transmit via air-borne droplets or aerosol among individuals with close proximity interactions; thus, the topological structure of CPI networks crucially affects transmission of respiratory diseases 5 ."/>
  <chunk id="8133996ea269ebe90ba8c1715cf462607997d975.c4" text="Due to the lack of real CPI data, idealized models of human contact networks are commonly employed to study epidemic behavior. For instance, one such model, the homogeneous network, assumes any individual to interact with a fixed number of partners 1,5 . This assumption of uniform spread pattern was implicitly adopted by the classical differential-equation approach 6 . Another model is the heterogeneous network, such as small-world or scale-free network, which was introduced to capture the fact that in real life, some people are more socially connected than others 7,8 . However, these idealized models were not fully examined on the basis of real CPI data.">
