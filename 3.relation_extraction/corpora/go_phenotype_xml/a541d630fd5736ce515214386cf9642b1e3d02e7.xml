  <chunk id="a541d630fd5736ce515214386cf9642b1e3d02e7.c1" text="Citation classics represent the highest impact work in a given field. We aim to identify and analyze the most frequently cited papers on brucellosis. We used the databases Scopus and Web of Science to determine the most frequently cited papers. The most cited fifty papers in each database were identified. We then ranked the papers according to the highest citation count recorded from any of the two databases. The most frequently cited paper received 964 citations and was by DelVecchio VG et al. reporting the complete genomic sequencing of Brucella melitensis. The papers were published in 30 journals led by the &quot;Infection and Immunity&quot; journal and the &quot;Veterinary Microbiology&quot; journal (each had 7 papers). Citation classics in brucellosis were all in English except one in French and were mostly of basic science type. In addition, we noticed that 12 articles that were identified among the highest fifty articles in one database were missed by the other database and vice versa. Therefore, we suggest that searching in more than one database would detect additional citation classics."/>
