The fraction, call it ζ, of these injection events that shed enough of a viral load to render a needle infected scales this rate, giving γζ(I E + I L ) Nu Ni+Nu . For simplicity, we set γζ = α."/>

We assume homogeneity, although in a setting with severely skewed distributions of needles among users' collections or in communities with wildly varying sharing practices, this approximation will be a poor one."/>

In this text, we follow the lines of [1], which establishes an algorithm for calculating R 0 as the maximum eigenvalue-also called the spectral radius-of the matrix −T ·Σ −1 . This matrix is sometimes cited as the Next Generation Matrix, however, as Diekmann et. al. (2009) [1] point out, this matrix may actually be larger than the true next generation matrix. Nevertheless, the maximum eigenvalue of −T · Σ −1 will be the same as that of the true next generation matrix. The steps to construct T and Σ are outlined in [1]. Essentially T + Σ = J, where"/>
