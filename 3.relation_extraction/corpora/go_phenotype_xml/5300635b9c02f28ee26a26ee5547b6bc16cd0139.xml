However, higher concentrations of chemokines were observed in asthmatic patients. Virus-infected monocyte cultures showed similar cytokine/ chemokine profiles to those observed in the patients."/>

Monocytes could play an important role in the increased circulating concentration of cytokines found during respiratory viral infections.">
