  <chunk id="36c57bd8ded4b2dc1a5859c15dea5c3800e23413.c1" text="The bat paramyxovirus B16-40 was first isolated in Korea in this study. Using the isolated virus, we could obtain not only genomic information, but also several biological characteristics of the virus. In the phylogenetic analysis, the virus was found to belong to the recently proposed genus Shaanvirus. Through sequence analyses and in vitro testing, the isolated virus was also found to have haemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) protein as one of the structural proteins. When mouse antiserum was generated against the isolated virus and tested, it was cross-reactive to human parainfluenza virus 1 in an indirect immunofluorescence assay but could not cross-neutralize human parainfluenza virus 1. In addition, the bat paramyxovirus B16-40 was not infectious in the mouse model. Collectively, this study provided basic information on further classification of the bat paramyxovirus B16-40 and related viruses in the proposed genus Shaanvirus."/>
