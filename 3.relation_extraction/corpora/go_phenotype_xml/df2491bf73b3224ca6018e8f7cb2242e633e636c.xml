However, inadequate initial epidemiological investigations sometimes lead to an inability to elucidate the causes of the spreading of infectious diseases and to establish clear disease prevention strategies as well as strategies to prevent recurrence. For timely prevention, it is necessary to find the sources and routes of infection through prompt epidemiological investigations in the initial stages of outbreak. To do this, the availability of epidemiology experts in infectious diseases and staff dedicated to infectious diseases is the most crucial factor [1]. Nevertheless, South Korea (hereafter Korea) currently lacks experienced field epidemiologists who have an adequate understanding of epidemiology of infectious diseases [2] ."/>

However, the 2015 outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome revealed limitations in the existing systems of management of field epidemiologists and communicable diseases."/>
