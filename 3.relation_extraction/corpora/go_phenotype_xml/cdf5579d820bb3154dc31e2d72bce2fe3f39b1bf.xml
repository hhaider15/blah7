  <chunk id="cdf5579d820bb3154dc31e2d72bce2fe3f39b1bf.c1" text="The objective of the study is to develop an Alignment-free tool for sequence clustering. To illustrate the effectiveness of our method we compared the distance matrices and the phylogenetic trees generated by our method with the other freely available recent alignmentfree tools [1] . The clustering efficiency of our tool can be noticed across all the benchmark datasets. The phylogenetic trees generated by our method and the other freely available recent methods shows superiority of our method over the other methods in terms of sequence clustering. The consistency can also be seen from the statistical analysis such as AUC (area under the ROC) values calculated from ROC (Receiver operating characteristic) curves. AUC values are often used to explain the accuracy of models and not to compare them. Accuracy classification of AUC is summarised in Table 1 , which is given below."/>

  <chunk id="cdf5579d820bb3154dc31e2d72bce2fe3f39b1bf.c3" text="A low AUC value does not necessarily imply a bad or poor model; rather it simply suggests that, besides the accounted predictors, other factors also exercise influence on the response variable. It is evident from the ROC plots below that our method's performance is in good agreement with other methods."/>
  <chunk id="cdf5579d820bb3154dc31e2d72bce2fe3f39b1bf.c4" text="The phylogenetic tree is generated by a distance matrix using PHYLIP package [7] which is equal to (1-similarity matrix) from equation (12) in our manuscript. We used similarity matrix for ROC analysis. We follow sonego et al.'s method [8] for calculating the ROC. In the similarity matrix, we put positive sign, if the two sequences belong to same class (i.e., genus level classification, phylum level classification, family level classification, etc.,) otherwise we put negative sign. We plotted the ROC curve by changing the decision threshold in either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing pattern lies between the minimum and maximum values of the similarity matrix. We plotted the FPR (false positive rate) on Xaxis and TPR (true positive rate) on Y-axis. Every point in the ROC curve corresponds to a discrete classifier that can be calculated using a decision threshold (Figure 3 in [8]). After plotting ROC curve, we calculated the area under the ROC curve (AUC)."/>
