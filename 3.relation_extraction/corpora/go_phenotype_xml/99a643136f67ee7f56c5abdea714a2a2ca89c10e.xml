Between 1985 and 2008, 37 studies met the inclusion criteria. The quality of the studies was highly variable. For children ,5 years, incidence ranged from 0.06±0.27 episodes per person-year and mortality ranged from 184±1,223 deaths per 100,000 population. Overall incidence and mortality were stable or decreased over the study period and were higher in rural compared to urban areas.">

Reliable surveillance data and new prevention efforts may be needed to achieve and document additional declines, especially in areas with higher incidence and mortality such as rural settings.">
