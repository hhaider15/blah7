  <chunk id="cdde042300059d2b850f850b56dc8c02d50b07e7.c1" text="Evidence of the mediation of glycan molecules in the interaction between viruses and their hosts is accumulating and is now partially reflected in several online databases. Bioinformatics provides convenient and efficient means of searching, visualizing, comparing, and sometimes predicting, interactions in numerous and diverse molecular biology applications related to the -omics fields. As viromics is gaining momentum, bioinformatics support is increasingly needed. We propose a survey of the current resources for searching, visualizing, comparing, and possibly predicting host-virus interactions that integrate the presence and role of glycans. To the best of our knowledge, we have mapped the specialized and general-purpose databases with the appropriate focus. With an illustration of their potential usage, we also discuss the strong and weak points of the current bioinformatics landscape in the context of understanding viral infection and the immune response to it.">

In turn, this anti-viral system is exploited by several viruses that target macrophages or dendritic cells for their replication, like the Ebola virus [8] and SARS virus [11] . Another unexpected role of host glycans is to evade immune system recognition of viral molecules. By having their virion surface proteins covered with host glycans, specific viral epitopes are physically hidden under neutral host molecules and cannot be recognized by immune cells. This effect is referred as to the glycan shield and the best example of this feature are the HIV virus, known to have the highest density of glycans attached to its surface proteins [12] , and the Lassa virus [13] .">

Nonetheless this remains a challenge because of the complexity of these interactions involving diverse host-virus hybrid molecules. The cellular machinery produces numerous sugars that can be combined into a broad variety of glycosylation types, allowing an extended heterogeneity of virion surface molecules. Studying such multifaceted interplay between glycans and viruses results in complex data that cannot be thoroughly understood without databases and bioinformatics [15] . The interpretation of large-scale analyses depends on comparative and predictive approaches in which biological databases play a crucial role. This emphasizes the importance of collecting, storing, curating, and making these data searchable online. Next, crosslinking the various specialized databases brings the user a broader view to grasp the complexity of multi-organism interactions. In the present review, we suggest that bioinformatics and databases are key to harnessing the potential for new knowledge discovery in virus and vaccine research. We also show that integrating complementary information from multiple sources is not straightforward.">
