  <chunk id="e2b435104da658ed6518247430cff1d428aae830.c1" text="The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) was a newly emerged infectious disease which caused a global epidemic in [2002][2003]. Sequence analysis of SARS-coronavirus isolates revealed that specific genotypes predominated at different periods of the epidemic. This information can be used as a footprint for tracing the epidemiology of infections and monitor viral evolution. However, direct sequencing analysis of a large number of clinical samples is cumbersome and time consuming. We present here a simple and rapid assay for the screening of SARScoronavirus genotypes based on the use of fluorogenic oligonucleotide probes for allelic discrimination.">

Allelic discrimination assays were developed based on the use of fluorogenic oligonucleotide probes (TaqMan). Genotyping of the SARScoronavirus isolates obtained from these patients were carried out by the allelic discrimination assays and confirmed by direct sequencing."/>

All of the 30 SARS-coronavirus genotypes studied were characteristic of genotypes previously documented to be associated with the latter part of the epidemic. Seven of the isolates contained a previously reported major deletion but in patients not epidemiologically related to the previously studied cohort."/>
