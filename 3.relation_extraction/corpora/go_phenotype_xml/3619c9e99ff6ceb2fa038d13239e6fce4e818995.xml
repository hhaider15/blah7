The assay exhibited high specificity for IBV infection. All negative controls, such as Newcastle disease virus, infectious bursal disease virus, and avian influenza virus, were not detected."/>

The test is a valuable and useful method as a routine assay for diagnosis of clinical IBV infection in commercial chickens.">
