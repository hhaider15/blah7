The stirring was continued while adding N-(6-mercapto-9H-purin-2-yl)acetamide (MH022; 0.5 mmol) into the mixture for 30 minutes at the same temperature. Lastly, cyclopentyl bromide (0.6 mmol) was added into the mixture and the stirring was continued while monitoring the reaction's progress using TLC with CHCl 3 : acetone (3:1) as a solvent. After the reaction completed, the mixture was diluted with 70 mL of water and then extracted using 3 x 70 mL of EtO-Ac. The organic phase was collected, washed with 3 x 70 mL of water and then dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate."/>
