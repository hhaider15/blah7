To demonstrate the efficiency of our method we compared the phylogenetic trees and the distance matrices generated by our method with the other freely available recent methods [1] . The superiority of the clustering performance of our method can be noticed in the following trees. We can see the superiority of efficient clustering of the sequences across all the benchmark datasets as compared to the other methods."/>

AUC values are often used to describe the accuracy of models and not to compare them. Accuracy classification of AUC is summarised in Table 1 , which is given below."/>
