In this study, an oral recombinant Lactobacillus casei vaccine against PEDV infection targeting the intestinal microfold (M) cells and dendritic cells (DCs) for delivering the core neutralizing epitope (COE) of PEDV spike protein was developed with M cell-targeting peptide (Col) and dendritic cell-targeting peptide (DCpep). The immunogenicity of the orally administered recombinant strains was evaluated.">

Moreover, in response to restimulation with the PEDV COE antigen in vitro, a significant difference in splenocyte proliferation response and Th2-associated cytokine IL-4 level was observed in the group of mice orally immunized with pPG-COE-Col-DCpep/L393 (p &lt; 0.05) compared to the groups of mice that received pPG-COE-Col/L393 and pPG-COE-DCpep/L393, respectively.">
