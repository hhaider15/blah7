  <chunk id="e31f9523d25a534a48452c6d78bd02b9c0222bca.c1" text="Severe bacterial pneumonia is a major global cause of morbidity and mortality, yet current diagnostic approaches rely on identification of causative pathogens by cultures, which require extended incubation periods and often fail to detect relevant pathogens. Consequently, patients are prescribed broad-spectrum antibiotics in a &quot;one-size-fits-all&quot; manner, which may be inappropriate for their individual needs and promote antibiotic resistance. My research focuses on leveraging next-generation sequencing of microbial DNA directly from patient samples for the development of new, culture-independent definitions of pneumonia. In this perspective article, I discuss the current state of the field and focus on the conceptual and research design challenges for clinical translation. With ongoing technological advancements and application of computational biology methods for assessing clinical validity and utility, I anticipate that sequencing-based diagnostics will soon be able to positively disrupt the way we think about, diagnose, and treat pulmonary infections.">
