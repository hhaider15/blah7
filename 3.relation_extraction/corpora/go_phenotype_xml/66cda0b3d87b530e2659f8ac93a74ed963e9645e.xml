  <chunk id="66cda0b3d87b530e2659f8ac93a74ed963e9645e.c1" text="Absolute, precise quantification methods expand the scope of nucleic acids research and have many practical applications. Digital polymerase chain reaction (dPCR) is a powerful method for nucleic acid detection and absolute quantification. However, it requires thermal cycling and accurate temperature control, which are difficult in resource-limited conditions. Accordingly, isothermal methods, such as recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), are more attractive. We developed a picoliter well array (PWA) chip with 27,000 consistently sized picoliter reactions (314 pL) for isothermal DNA quantification using digital RPA (dRPA) at 39°C. Sample loading using a scraping liquid blade was simple, fast, and required small reagent volumes (i.e., &lt;20 μL). Passivating the chip surface using a methoxy-PEG-silane agent effectively eliminated cross-contamination during dRPA. Our creative optical design enabled wide-field fluorescence imaging in situ and both end-point and real-time analyses of picoliter wells in a 6-cm 2 area. It was not necessary to use scan shooting and stitch serial small images together. Using this method, we quantified serial dilutions of a Listeria monocytogenes gDNA stock solution from 9 × 10 -1 to 4 × 10 -3 copies per well with an average error of less than 11% (N = 15). Overall dRPA-on-chip processing required less than 30 min, which was a 4-fold decrease compared to dPCR, requiring approximately 2 h. dRPA on the PWA chip provides a simple and highly sensitive method to quantify nucleic acids without thermal cycling or precise micropump/microvalve control. It has applications in fast field analysis and critical clinical diagnostics under resource-limited settings.">

  <chunk id="66cda0b3d87b530e2659f8ac93a74ed963e9645e.c2" text="All RPA reactions were performed using the RPA Exo Kit (TwistDx, Cambridge, UK) according to the manufacturer's protocol, with the exception of the addition of Mg 2+ . After Mg 2+ was added, amplification began, unlike conventional PCR triggered by a &quot;hot-start.&quot; Genomic DNA from L. monocytogenes strain EGDe (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) gDNA was used at concentrations given for the dRPA. Dilution was performed in sterile tubes using DNase/ RNase-free water (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The primers and probes were provided in the L. monocytogenes Kit from TwistDx. The sequences can be found in S1 Table. To prepare 50-μL reactions, 5 μL of resuspended oligo mix, 29.5 μL of TwistAmp rehydration buffer, and 11.5 μL of DNA sample were vortexed and centrifuged briefly in a 1.5-mL tube. Subsequently, the reaction mix was used to rehydrate the freeze-dried enzyme pellet. To avoid amplification in the bulk, 4 μL of 280 mM MgAc solution was prepared separately on ice and added to the ice-cold reaction mixture (oligo mix, buffer, template, and enzyme) directly prior to fast sample loading.">
