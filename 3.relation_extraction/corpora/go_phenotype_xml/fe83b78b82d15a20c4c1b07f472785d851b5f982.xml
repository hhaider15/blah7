Procalcitonin was sequentially assessed and patients classified according to the probability of the presence of a bacterial infection.">

The PCT levels were assessed in 32/34 patients, median values were: 0.493 g/L [IQR, 0.131 to 1.471] at the time of admission, 0.724 g/L [IQR, 0.167 to 2.646] at six hours, and 0.557 g/L [IQR, 0.123 to 3.4] at 24 hours. The highest PCT (PCTmax) levels were less than 0.1 g/L in 3/32 (9%) patients and greater than 0.25 g/L in 22/32 (69%) patients, suggesting low and high probability of bacterial infection, respectively. Fifteen bacteria and five viruses were detected in 15/ 34 (44%) patients. Bacteria were not detected in patients with PCTmax levels &lt; 0.1 g/L. In contrast, bacteria were detected in 4/7 (57%) patients estimated unlikely to have a bacterial infection by PCT levels (PCTmax &gt; 0.1 and &lt; 0.25 g/L)."/>

Further studies testing procalcitonin-based antibiotic strategies are needed in COPD patients with severe pneumonia.">
