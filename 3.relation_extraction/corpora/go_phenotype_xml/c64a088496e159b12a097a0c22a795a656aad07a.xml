  <chunk id="c64a088496e159b12a097a0c22a795a656aad07a.c1" text="Some novel 2,3-dioxo-5-(substituted)arylpyrroles have been synthesized. Among these, pyrrolidine compound 1b was converted to 2,3-dioxo-5-aryl pyrrolidine 2b. Finally a set of hydrazone derivatives was obtained from the reaction of 2b with various hydrazine salts. The structures of all the new synthesized compounds were confirmed by elemental analyses, IR and 1 H-NMR spectra."/>
