Therefore, PubMed searches were carried out using the search terms &quot;(models, theoretical [MeSH Terms]) AND dynamic* AND (analysis OR mathematic*) AND transmission AND infection* AND (carriage OR carrier* OR asymptomatic* OR coloni*)&quot; identifying 132 articles. Of these, 101 articles were excluded because they were either reviews that did not present novel work, or because they presented either exclusively within-host models, models not incorporating symptomatic hosts, models including pathogen vectors, models where asymptomatic hosts are non-infectious, or statistical models. We then included a further eleven articles identified through manually searching. This left a total of 42 articles presenting 45 models of the transmission of various infectious diseases in the presence of asymptomatic carriers, which are summarised in Figure S1 .">
