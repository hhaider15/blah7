  <chunk id="4dd9d9ada59d79f3212e4451dd620f25cc84d86d.c1" text="Background: Patchouli alcohol (PA) is a tricyclic sesquiterpene extracted from Pogostemonis Herba, which is a traditional Chinese medicine used for therapy of inflammatory diseases. Recent studies have shown that PA has various pharmacological activities, including anti-bacterial and anti-viral effects."/>
  <chunk id="4dd9d9ada59d79f3212e4451dd620f25cc84d86d.c2" text="Methods: In this study, the anti-influenza virus (IAV) activities and mechanisms were investigated both in vitro and in vivo. The inhibitory effects of PA against IAV in vitro were evaluated by plaque assay and immunofluorescence assay. The neuraminidase inhibition assay, hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay, and western blot assay were used to explore the anti-viral mechanisms. The anti-IAV activities in vivo were determined by mice pneumonia model and HE staining.">

Cellular PI3K/Akt and ERK/MAPK signaling pathways may be involved in the anti-IAV actions of PA. Intranasal administration of PA markedly improved mice survival and attenuated pneumonia symptoms in IAV infected mice, comparable to the effects of Oseltamivir. Conclusions: Therefore, Patchouli alcohol has the potential to be developed into a novel anti-IAV agent in the future.">
