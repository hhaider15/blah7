  <chunk id="31389549_en.c1" text="The aim of the present study was to evaluate knowledge, attitudes and practices regarding tuberculosis (TB) among transvestites and transsexual women. A cross-sectional study was conducted with a convenience sample (n = 124; 58 transvestites and 66 transsexuals) in the city of São Paulo, Brazil, in 2014 and involved the administration of the Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices questionnaire. Absolute and relative frequencies were calculated for all variables and the comparisons of percentage distributions between groups were performed using Pearson's Chi-square test, Fisher's exact test or its generalization, with a 5% significance level. Most participants were young and non-white. Transvestites had lower levels of schooling, reported more passages through the prison system and declared themselves to be sex workers more frequently. Little more than half of the participants were aware that treatment for TB was free of charge. Knowledge on TB was modest, permeated with misunderstandings regarding signs/symptoms, transmission and prevention, which influence attitudes and practices in relation to the disease. The findings demonstrate that health education actions do not achieve their goals in the control of tuberculosis.">
