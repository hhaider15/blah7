  <chunk id="31365689_en.c1" text="to characterize confirmed human leptospirosis cases resident in Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, between 2007 and 2013, and their spatial distribution.this was a descriptive study of cases registered on the Notifiable Diseases Information System; we investigated neighborhoods and areas in the catchment area of Health Units (US) with highest case occurrence, using spatial analysis as per the Kernel technique.228 cases were confirmed in the period, with cumulative incidence of 2.3 cases/100,000 inhabitants; the majority were adult males (81.6%), economically active (82.5%) and had low schooling (45.8%); the main occupations were recyclable waste collector (15.8%) and builder/builder's mate (15.2%); six priority US were identified for leptospirosis control and prevention actions.the epidemiological profile and spatial distribution of cases suggest that there continue to be environmental risk factors favoring human leptospirosis occurrence in these areas.">
