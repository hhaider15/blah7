  <chunk id="29412427_en.c1" text="To evaluate the association between nutritional status, lung function and morbidity in a 36-month cohort in children and adolescents with cystic fibrosis.Prospective cohort of children and adolescents with cystic fibrosis aged 1-15 years. At the baseline, the nutritional status was determined by weight-for-height and body mass index-for-age for children &lt;2 years and â‰¥2 years, respectively, and classified as: nutritional failure, nutritional risk and acceptable; and by the 50th percentile, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) growth charts. Lung function was assessed by forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1). Morbidity was determined by the presence of infection and hospitalization by pulmonary exacerbation. Risk ratio and 95% confidence interval (95%CI) were calculated, being significant when p&lt;0.05.We evaluated 38 children and adolescents (median age 3.8 years). Patients that were classified as having nutritional failure at baseline had a RR of 5.00 (95%CI 1.49; 16.76) to present impaired lung function after 36 months. Those classified bellow the 50th percentile had a RR of 4.61 (95%CI 0.89; 23.81) to present the same outcome. Nutritional status was not a risk factor for morbidity in this cohort.Nutritional deficit was associated with impaired lung function, but not with morbidity in children and adolescents with cystic fibrosis.">
