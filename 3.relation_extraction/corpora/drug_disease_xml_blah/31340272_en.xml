  <chunk id="31340272_en.c1" text="AIDS is an advanced clinical manifestation of HIV infection. It generates severe immunodeficiency and associated infections that may lead to death. The antiretroviral therapy (ART) has reduced the morbimortality of HIV/AIDS, but its benefits depend on ART adherence. This integrative review followed the PICO method to identify factors associated with adult adherence to ART. Empirical papers published between January 2010 and December 2016 in the Medline, SciELO, Lilacs and PePSIC databases were included. We analyzed 125 papers regarding the characteristics of studies, adherence measures and associated factors. Results showed a wide variety in the definition of adherence and the use of measures for its monitoring, as well as several adherence-associated factors. These were categorized as follows: 1- Individual variables; 2- Treatment characteristics; 3- HIV/aids infection characteristics; 4- Relationship with the health services; 5- Social support. Health services should characterize the users' profiles, systematize adherence measures and regionally assess adherence-associated factors for the early detection of non-adherence to ART and implementation of effective intervention plans.">
