  <chunk id="30365698_en.c1" text="to describe the geographical distribution of intermediate hosts of Schistosoma mansoni in five Brazilian states.this was a descriptive cross-sectional study; municipalities were selected in the states of Paraná (78), Minas Gerais (120), Bahia (82), Pernambuco (51) , and Rio Grande do Norte (98), for the period 2012 to 2014; these municipalities were chosen because they did not have current records of the presence of snails vectores de S. mansoni. The molluscs were captured and taxonomically identified and examined for S. mansoni cercariae.the work was carried out in 427 municipalities (99.5% of the 429 selected); the presence of mollusks was registered in 300 (70.2%) municipalities; Biomphalaria glabrata were found in 62 (21%) municipalities, B. straminea in 181 (60%), B. tenagophila in three (1%); B. glabrata/B. straminea association was found in 53 municipalities (18%) and B. glabrata/B. tenagophila association in one (0.3%) municipality.B. glabrata, B. straminea and B. tenagophila distribution records obtained in this study are consistent with previously known distribution."/>
