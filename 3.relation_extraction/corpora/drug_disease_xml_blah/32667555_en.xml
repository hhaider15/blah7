  <chunk id="32667555_en.c1" text="Popular Education in Health (PEH) is a field of knowledge and practices permeated by listening, dialogue, and action. With a set of national experiences and productions, it is a political-pedagogical movement that articulates forces from various social and popular segments, health workers, educators, and researchers in collective health, among other actors. Supported by authors such as Paulo Freire and Victor Valla, among others, PEH has been strengthened in the dimensions of training, participation, management, and health care. Despite the dismantling experienced today in the Brazilian public scene, the PEH Thematic Group (TG) of the Brazilian Association of Public Health (ABRASCO) has been helping to foster, design, and express the voicing of the construction and development of participatory educational and democratic processes in Brazil. This paper showcases the experiences and elaborations of the TG members through the report of the collegiate coordination center members of the last administrations, a period of changes in the political, social, economic, educational and health scenarios, including the influence of the current planetary crisis brought about by the effects of COVID-19, especially in the Brazilian society."/>
