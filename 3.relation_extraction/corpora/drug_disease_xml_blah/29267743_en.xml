  <chunk id="29267743_en.c1" text="Tuberculosis remains as a global public health problem and its occurrence and distribution is associated with social inequalities.

The study aimed to combine social indicators into a composite indicator to measure differences in living conditions of the population in Itaboraí, as well as evidence of health inequalities related to tuberculosis.An ecological study, with spatial analysis of tuberculosis and its relation to socioeconomic and demographic status of households. Data were obtained from individuals declared in the Mortality Information System (SIM), notified in the Notification of Injury Information System - SINAN or Tuberculosis Special Treatment Information System - SITETB from 2007 to 2013.Evidence indicates association between sociodemographic inequalities and occurrence of tuberculosis in the population.
