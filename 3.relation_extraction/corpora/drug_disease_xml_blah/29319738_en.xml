  <chunk id="29319738_en.c1" text="To analyze the effects of nanoparticle-based dressings on the wound healing process in in vitro animals and human cells based on scientific evidence.A systematic review of the literature in LILACS, PubMed and Science Direct databases. The articles were selected and evaluated for the level of evidence by the application of STROBE.The sample consisted of 12 articles. The application of the products occurred in surgical wounds, burns, infected wounds and gingival ulcers in laboratory animals, as well as in vitro tests, demonstrating that among other advantages, the nanoparticle-based dressings increased the healing speed, had good antibacterial capacity and were non cytotoxic agents.Based on the analyzed articles, it can be affirmed that dressings containing nanocomposites are quite promising and are shown as a great therapeutic option in wound healing."/>
