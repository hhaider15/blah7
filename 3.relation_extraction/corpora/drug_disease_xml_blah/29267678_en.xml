  <chunk id="29267678_en.c1" text="This quantitative study in the city of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, compared contexts of social vulnerability and sexual and reproductive behavior in a sample of 975 women living with HIV/AIDS (WLHIV) and 1,003 women not living with HIV, the latter recruited among users of the primary healthcare system. WLHIV experienced situations of greater vulnerability that potentially increased their risk of HIV infection and unplanned pregnancy and abortion. Compared to women users of the primary healthcare system, WLHIV reported higher rates of drug use, sex for money, exposure to intimate partner violence, difficulties in access to services for prevention and early diagnosis, unplanned pregnancies, induced abortion, and teenage pregnancy. A considerable number of the women users of the primary healthcare system shared these same experiences, but at lower rates. The identification of contexts of vulnerability and the integration of HIV testing services with sexual and reproductive health services should constitute lines of care for these women, both in specialized and primary care services.">
