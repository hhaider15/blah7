  <chunk id="29267726_en.c1" text="This study investigated factors associated with cases of tuberculosis retreatment due to relapse and readmission after treatment abandonment. This is an analytical cross-sectional study type of cases reported in the Information System for Notifiable Diseases in priority municipalities in the State of Maranhão, from January 2005 to December 2010. A logistic regression model was used to identify the association. Patients aged between 40 and 59 years (OR = 1.49, p = 0.029) with a pulmonary clinical form (OR = 2.79, p = 0.016) were more likely to incur relapse. Readmissions after abandonment were more likely in males (OR = 1.53, p = 0.046), aged between 20 and 39 years (OR = 1.65, p = 0.007), with less than eight years of schooling (OR = 2.01, p = 0.037) and with alcohol dependence (OR=1.66, p = 0.037), which showed a higher probability of another abandonment (OR = 5.96, p &lt; 0.001). These data reinforce the need for strategies aimed at this group, such as increased supervised treatment, intensified active search, post-discharge follow-up and health education action.">
