1|chunk|To describe and evaluate the factors associated with actions for the control of tuberculosis (TB) in primary care (PC) in the five Brazilian macroregions.This cross-sectional study was carried out with data from the second cycle of the National Program for Improving Access to and Quality of Primary Care. Theoutcome of the study was constructed based on a set of items that were considered essential for the treatment and control of tuberculosis in Primary Care Units (PCUs). Data were analyzed using the 2 test and Poisson regression with robust variance.The national prevalence of the set of items to control tuberculosis was 17.22%. TheNortheast (11.18%) and North (12.15%) had the worst performance. The main results indicate association with this outcome for PCUs performing educational actions for TB (PR = 1.53; 95%CI 1.45 - 1.62), those performing HIV serology (PR = 1.68; 95%CI 1.11 - 2.54), those that have a reception room (PR = 1.61; 95%CI 1.46 - 1.79) and those performing continuing education activities (PR = 1.73; 95%CI 1.54 - 1.95).The results show a weakness in the structures and in the work process of PC in relation to the control of tuberculosis in all Brazilian regions.
