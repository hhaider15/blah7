1|chunk|The study assessed the association between environmental characteristics obtained by remote sensing and prevalence of canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) in the neighborhood of Jacar, an area with recent introduction of the disease in the municipality (county) of Niteri, Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil. This was a cross-sectional study to assess CVL prevalence, defined as a positive result in the dual path platform (DPP) rapid immunochromatographic assay, confirmed by immunoenzymatic assay (IEA). The study included 97 dogs, with 21.6% CVL prevalence. CVL prevalence was higher in dogs with contact with another dog, opossum, marmoset, or hedgehog, as well as history of culling of other dogs with CVL from the household. In the multivariate analysis, adjusted for the dog's sex and age, dogs in areas with sparse vegetation showed fivefold higher prevalence of Leishmania infantum infection compared to dogs in areas with less vegetation (OR = 5.72; 95%CI: 1.47-22.20). Meanwhile, less urbanized areas, characterized as commercial or low-income residential areas, identified by remote sensing as those with high density of gray structures, were associated with lower CVL prevalence (OR = 0.09; 95%CI: 0.01-0.92). The higher prevalence of infection in dogs living alongside wild animals and in areas with more vegetation and lower prevalence in more urbanized areas suggest a rural transmission pattern for CVL in this area.
