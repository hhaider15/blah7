1|chunk|Syphilis is a sexually transmitted disease, easy to diagnose and treat, but whose incidence is increasing in Brazil. This study estimated the prevalence of the non-performance of serological tests for syphilis during prenatal care, in addition to evaluating its trend and identifying its associated factors in the municipality of Rio Grande, Rio Grande do Sul, Southern Brazil.This is a cross-sectional survey that included all pregnant women living in this municipality who gave birth between January 1 and December 31, 2007, 2010, and 2013. A single standardized questionnaire was administered to the mothers within 48 hours of delivery, while they were still in the maternity ward. We used the 2 test for proportions and linear trend, and Poisson regression with robust adjustment in the multivariate analysis. The effect measure adopted was prevalence ratio (PR).Among the 7,351 mothers who had at least one prenatal visit, the prevalence of non-performance of serological tests for syphilis in the three years studied was 2.9% (95% confidence interval - 95%CI 2.56 - 3.33), with 3.3% (95%CI 2.56 - 3.97) in 2007, 2.8% (95%CI 2.20 - 3.52) in 2010, and 2.7% (95%CI 2.12 - 3.38) in 2013. Black mothers, those with low household income and schooling, and who had few prenatal visits showed higher PR of non-performance of this test.The prevalence of non-performance has virtually not changed in the period, and women with high-risk pregnancy showed a greater probability of not undergoing the test.This municipality needs to reach mothers with lower socioeconomic status, restructure the local health services, and enhance their operationalization to improve the quality of prenatal care.
