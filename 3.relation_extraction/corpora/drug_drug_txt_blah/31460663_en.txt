New cases under the age of 15 have been included in the state.

Detection in < 15 years was significantly increased between 2001 and 2008 (anual percent change - APC = 3.8%; confidence interval of 95% - 95%CI 0.1 - 7.6), and showed significant decline between 2008 and 2012 (APC = -9.4%; 95%CI -17.2 - -0.8). There was stability for the detection of grade 2 cases (APC = 4.2%; 95%CI -6.7 - 16.3), proportion of grade 2 cases (APC = 4.1%; 95%CI 6.7 - 16.3), proportion of grade 1 cases (APC = 1.3%; 95%CI -6.2 - 9.3), multibacillary ratio (APC = 2.9%; 95%CI -1.7 - 7.7), and proportion of paucibacillary (APC = 2.9%; 95%CI -1.7 - 7.7).Leprosy remains an important public health problem in Tocantins, with active transmission and persistence of transmission foci.
