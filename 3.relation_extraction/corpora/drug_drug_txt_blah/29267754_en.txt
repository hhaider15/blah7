1|chunk|In Brazil, the spatial distribution of leprosy is heterogeneous. Areas with high transmission of the disease remain in the North, Center-west and Northeast. Areas with high transmission of the disease remain in the Northern, Central-Western and Northeastern regions of the country.to describe the spatial distribution of leprosy in municipalities with high risk of transmission, in the periods from 2001 - 2003 and 2010 - 2012.This was an ecological study using data from the Notifiable Diseases Information System (SINAN). They included all municipalities in the states of Mato Grosso, Tocantins, Rondnia, Par and Maranho. The following leprosy indicators were calculated per 100,000 inhabitants: incidence rate of leprosy, incidence rate in children aged less than 15 years and rate of new cases with grade 2 disabilities. The spatial scan statistic was used to detect significant clusters (p  0.05) in the study area.In the period 2001 - 2003, the scan spatial statistics identified 44 significant clusters for the leprosy incidence rate, and 42 significant clusters in the period 2010 - 2012. In the period 2001 - 2003, it was possible to identify 20 significant clusters to the incidence rate in children aged less than 15, and 14 significant clusters in the period 2010 - 2012. For the rate of new cases with grade 2 disability, the scan statistics identified 19 significant clusters in the period 2001 - 2003, and 14 significant clusters in the period 2010 - 2012.Despite the reduction in the detection of leprosy cases, there is a need intensify disease control actions, especially in the clusters identified.
