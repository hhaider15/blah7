1|chunk|Sepsis represents the occurrence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome triggered by the initial infection of an organ or system. When sepsis is certified as the cause of death, the first diagnosis is lost, leading to inaccurate information as to its origin.To analyze the underlying causes of death from sepsis after investigation in 60 Brazilian municipalities in 2017.All deaths recorded in the Mortality Information System (SIM) as sepsis in 2017 were selected, and the proportions of reclassified deaths were calculated based on the results of research conducted in hospitals and other health services.Of the 6,486 deaths from sepsis that occurred in the 60 municipalities, 1,584 (24.4%) were investigated, and of these, 1,308 (82.6%) were reclassified with other underlying causes. Individuals aged from 70 to 89 years old showed the highest concentration in the records, with 49.3% of cases. More than 60% of the deaths from sepsis reclassified after the investigation had chronic non-communicable diseases as underlying causes (65.6%), with diabetes being the most common specific cause in this group. Communicable diseases (9.6%) and external causes (5.6%) such as falls were also detected as underlying causes.The investigation of deaths from sepsis made it possible to identify the true causes of death and the proportions of reclassification. This information will improve the quality of mortality data and support the planning of public health actions in Brazil.
