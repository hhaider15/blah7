1|chunk|To analyze how syphilis detection rates evolved from 2011 to 2017 according to sex, age and place of residence in the state of So Paulo.A historical series was organized with data from the Notification Disease Information System. The acquired syphilis detection rates (ASDR) per 100,000 inhabitants and the acquired syphilis detection rates including pregnant women with syphilis (PASDR) per 100,000 inhabitants were described. For a trend analysis of the rates in the studied period, the Poisson Jointpoint (inflection point) model was performed, and the annual percentage change (APC) per segment and the average annual percentage change (AAPC) were estimated, with respective 95% confidence intervals (95%CI).A total of 205,424 cases of acquired syphilis and syphilis in pregnant women in the period were reported. The ASDR per 100,000 inhabitants ranged from 26.0 to 84.6 between 2011 and 2017 and the PASDR per 100,000 inhabitants ranged from 33.7 to 108.9; the trend was increasing in both, and an inflection point was identified dividing the ASDR and PASDR curve into two periods: 2011 to 2013 and 2013 to 2017: the AAPC found for ASDR was 21.0% (95%CI 15.5  26.4) and the PASDR was 21.2% (95%CI 16.4  26.1), in the age groups up to 24 years old, there was a significant growth in both sexes. A heterogeneity in the evolution of rates by region of the state was observed between 2011 and 2017.The increasing trend in acquired syphilis detection rates can be attributed to better adherence to notification and disproportionate involvement of young people.
