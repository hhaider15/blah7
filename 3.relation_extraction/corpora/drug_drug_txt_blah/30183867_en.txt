1|chunk|to describe the challenges in implementing the chikungunya surveillance and prevention system in Brazil.this was a descriptive study of suspected cases of the disease based on records held on the Notifiable Diseases Information System (Sinan) for the period 2014-2016.more than 100,000 probable chikungunya cases were notified in Brazil in this period, with the largest concentration in the Northeast states (83.3% between 2014 and 2015; 91.0% in 2016); Sinan provided an excellent opportunity for closing records of cases occurring between 2014 and 2015 (85%) and high completeness of obligatory variables.given the imminence of the introduction of chikungunya in Brazil in 2014, advance public health preparation took place in order to minimize its effects on society; implementation of the surveillance system improved collection of information regarding the disease, however many challenges can be seen in practice, in view of increasing case incidence. This requires greater handling capacity in this sector.
