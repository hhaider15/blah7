  <chunk id="96f0cf86f03bfe173c1b161ae5936757fb6a9b0e.c1" text="Background: Avian influenza A (H7N9) remains circulating in China. For countries at risk of introduction of H7N9, such as Vietnam, early detection of H7N9 virus is essential for the early containment of the virus. Insulated isothermal reverse transcriptase PCR (iiRT-PCR) is a portable PCR system that can be deployed under field conditions to identify pathogens at the sampling site. Applying PCR at the sampling site will greatly reduce the time to obtain a diagnostic result which allows the veterinary authority to take immediate action to contain disease spreading.">

Fifty oropharyngeal samples from experimentally infected chicken and ducks with H7N9 and 50 non-infected control swabs were tested by the H7 iiRT-PCR to determine diagnostic sensitivity and specificity."/>
