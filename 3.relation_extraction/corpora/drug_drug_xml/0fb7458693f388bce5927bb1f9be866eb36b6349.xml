  <chunk id="0fb7458693f388bce5927bb1f9be866eb36b6349.c1" text="Introduction: Allergic reaction to dust mites is a relatively common condition among children, triggering cutaneous and respiratory responses that have a great impact on the health of this population. Anaphylactic hypersensitivity is characterized by an exacerbated response involving the production of regulatory cytokines responsible for stimulating the production of IgE antibodies."/>

Other associations were observed in the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL1A 2889 Conclusion: Our results suggest a possible association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in cytokine genes and hypersensitivity to dust mites.">
