Maternal antibodies represent the main shield of neonate mammals for most of the infections. Two recombinant antigens (SA35 and SA40), portions of two C. parvum proteins, were tested for their ability to induce immune responses in adult mice and for protection on neonate BALB/c mice born from females immunised by mucosal delivery of both peptides.">

Furthermore, BALB/c pregnant mice were immunised by mucosal delivery with an SA35/40 mix, before and during pregnancy. Soon after birth, their offspring were infected with two doses (1 × 10 5 and 5 × 10 3 ) of C. parvum oocysts and the parasitic burden was determined at 5 and 9 days post-infection."/>

Neonates born from immunised mice and infected with 1 × 10 5 oocysts showed a significant reduction of oocysts and intestinal forms (23 and 42%, respectively). A reduction of all parasitic forms (96%; P &lt; 0.05) was observed when neonates were infected with 5 × 10 3 oocysts."/>

Moreover, mucosal administration of the SA35/40 mix in pregnant mice reduces C. parvum burden in their litters.">
