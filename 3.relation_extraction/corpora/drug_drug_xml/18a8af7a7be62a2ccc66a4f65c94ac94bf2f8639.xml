  <chunk id="18a8af7a7be62a2ccc66a4f65c94ac94bf2f8639.c1" text="Background: Steroid-induced osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) is the most common clinical nontraumatic ONFH. Once ONFH occurs, it seriously reduces patients' quality of life. The matrix metalloproteinase/tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (MMP/ TIMP) system was found to play a significant role in the development of ONFH. The aim of this study was to identify the associations between 7 genes selected from the MMP/TIMP system and steroid-induced ONFH.">

Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using the chi-squared test, genetic model analysis, haplotype analysis, and stratification analysis."/>

In the genetic model analysis, we found that rs3740938, rs2012390, rs1940475, and rs11225395 were associated with an increased risk of steroid-induced ONFH. In further stratification analysis, rs3740938 and rs2012390 displayed a significantly increased risk of steroid-induced ONFH in females under the dominant (rs3740938, OR = 2.69, 95% CI: 1.50-4.83, P = 0.001; rs2012390, OR = 2.30, 95% CI: 1.31-4.03, P = 0.012) and additive (rs3740938, OR = 2.02, 95% CI: 1.24-3.29, P = 0.010; rs2012390, OR = 1.77, 95% CI: 1.12-2.80, P = 0.047) models. In addition, haplotype &quot;AGTCA&quot; of MMP8 was found to be associated with a 1.40-fold increased risk of steroid-induced ONFH (95% CI: 1.04-1.88, P = 0.025)."/>
