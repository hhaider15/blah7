  <chunk id="3c9db7ee30074667f9fe308de9910b013aa1f163.c1" text="Background and Aim: Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has rapidly spread throughout the Middle East since its discovery in 2012. The virus poses a significant global public health threat with potentially devastating effects. In this study, a recombinant adenoviral-based vaccine encoding the spike 1 (S1) subunit of the MERS-CoV genome was constructed, and its humoral, and cellular immune responses were evaluated in mice."/>

Expression of the S1 protein in the lungs and kidneys was detected using conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) targeting specific regions within the S1 subunit at weeks 3, 4, 5, and 6 after the first vaccination. Antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses were evaluated in serum and in cell culture following in vitro stimulation with a specific 9-mer epitope within the S1 protein (CYSSLILDY).">

The vaccine elicited a specific S1-immunoglobulin G antibody response, which was detected in the sera of the vaccinated mice at weeks 4 and 6 from the onset of the first immunization. There was a significant increase in the amount of Th1-related cytokines (interferon-Î³ and interleukin [IL] 12), and a significant decrease in the Th2-related cytokine IL-4 in splenocyte cell culture of the vaccinated group compared with the control groups.">
