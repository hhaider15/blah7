Definite bacterial infection was defined by proven culture results, and probable bacterial infection was based on diagnostic modalities other than culture. The sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score of 2 points or more from the baseline was diagnosed as sepsis. PCT was measured by the AFIAS-6 immunoassay system (Boditech Med Inc.) using whole blood. White blood cell (WBC), C-reactive protein (CRP), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ERS) were evaluated.">
