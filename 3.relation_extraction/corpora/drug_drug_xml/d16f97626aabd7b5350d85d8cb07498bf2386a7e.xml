The data used for these analyses are publicly available at https://github.com/reichlab/activemonitr (current version of code), or at https: //doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.260135 (static release as of 26 January 2017)."/>

The gamma distribution is one of several &quot;heavy-tailed&quot; distributions often used to describe incubation periods, and aligns with assumptions made by previous researchers. (2) We assumed uninformative, flat priors on the shape and scale parameters of the gamma distribution.">

First, we adjusted the size of the proposal distributions to obtain acceptance rates between 30% and 40%. Second, we visually inspected the resulting chains to assess convergence. Third, we thinned the posterior samples to reduce auto-correlation between observations. Fourth, we computed the Gelman and RubinR multiple sequence diagnostic to assess convergence across chains (3). Fifth, we specified the appropriate number of samples, burn-in, and thinning rates to obtain 1 million posterior samples for smallpox and MERS-CoV and 3 million for Ebola."/>
