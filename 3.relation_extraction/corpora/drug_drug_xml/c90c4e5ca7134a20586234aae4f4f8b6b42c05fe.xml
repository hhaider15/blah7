  <chunk id="c90c4e5ca7134a20586234aae4f4f8b6b42c05fe.c1" text="In 2005, China implemented a demonstration program known as &quot;686&quot; to scale-up nationwide basic mental health services designed to improve access to evidence-based care and to promote human rights for people with severe mental disorders. As part of the 686 Program, teams &quot;unlocked&quot; and provided continuous mental health care to people with severe mental disorders who were found in restraints and largely untreated in their family homes. We implemented a nation-wide two-stage follow-up study to measure the effectiveness and sustainability of the &quot;unlocking and treatment&quot; intervention and its impact on the well-being of patients' families."/>

In 2012, 230 of the 266 cases were re-interviewed (the Stage Two study). Outcome measures included the patient medication adherence and social functioning, family burden ratings, and relocking rate. We utilized pre-post tests to analyze the changes over time following the unlocking efforts."/>
