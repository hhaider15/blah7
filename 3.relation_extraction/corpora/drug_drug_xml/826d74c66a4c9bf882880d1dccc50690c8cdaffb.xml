  <chunk id="826d74c66a4c9bf882880d1dccc50690c8cdaffb.c1" text="Background: Human bocavirus (HBoV) is a newly identified human parvovirus. HBoV is associated with upper and lower respiratory tract infections and gastroenteritis in children. Little is known about the seroepidemiology of HBoV in populations in the Caribbean."/>
  <chunk id="826d74c66a4c9bf882880d1dccc50690c8cdaffb.c2" text="Methods: In a cross-sectional study conducted at the University Hospital of the West Indies in Kingston, Jamaica, 287 blood samples were collected from pediatric patients and tested for the presence of HBoV-specific antibody using a virus-likeparticle based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)."/>
  <chunk id="826d74c66a4c9bf882880d1dccc50690c8cdaffb.c3" text="Results: HBoV-specific antibodies were found to be present in 220/287 (76.7%) of samples collected from the pediatric population. Seroprevalence of HBoV was highest in those $2 years old. The seroepidemiological profile suggests that most children are exposed to HBoV during the first two years of life in Jamaica."/>
