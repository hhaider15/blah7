  <chunk id="a9467bbfc6a67f8a76ac8242a14207676d03c041.c1" text="To date, only influenza and RSV testing are recommended for respiratory viruses' detection in paediatric units. In this study, we described, according to seasons, ages and clinical units, the results obtained in children (&lt;15 years old) by multiplex-PCR (mPCR) tests allowing a quick and wide range detection of all respiratory viruses. These results were also compared with RSV specific detection."/>

Positivity and viral co-infection rates were higher in the 6-36 months old strata (81% and 25%, p&lt;0.0001 and p = 0.04, respectively). Viral distribution showed strong variations across ages. During specific influenza epidemic periods, only 1/39 (2.5%) mPCR tests were positive for influenza and 19/39 (48.7%) for other viruses. During specific RSV epidemic periods, only 8/46 (17.4%) mPCR tests were positive for RSV and 14/46 (30.4%) for other viruses. 477/1529 (31.2%) of RSV immunochromatography-tests were positive.
