The isolated porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) CH/GDGZ/2012 strain was obtained from the feces of diseased pigs in 2012 in southern China. We report the complete genome sequence of strain CH/GDGZ/2012, which might be useful for better understanding the molecular characteristics of this virus."/>
