NSG mice were humanized with: (1) umbilical cord derived CD34 + stem cells, (2) fetal derived liver, thymus and CD34 + stem cells or (3) primary human skeletal muscle cells. NSG and humanized NSG mice were infected with 100 O. volvulus infective larvae (L3) for 4 to 12 weeks. When necropsies of infected animals were performed, it was observed that parasites survived and developed throughout the infection time course. In each of the different humanized mouse models, worms matured from L3 to advanced fourth stage larvae, with both male and female organ development. In addition, worms increased in length by up to 4-fold. Serum and urine, collected from humanized mice for identification of potential biomarkers of infection, allowed for the identification of 10 O. volvulus-derived proteins found specifically in either the urine or the serum of the humanized O. volvulus-infected NSG mice.">

  <chunk id="26ee25b06063d12c5685b764db2c72fbb17fc31f.c4" text="PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | https://doi.Onchocerciasis, caused by the filarial parasitic nematode Onchocerca volvulus, remains a significant source of morbidity throughout sub-Saharan Africa and is a primary cause of infectious blindness. Research on this disease has been hindered by an absence of suitable small animal hosts. Here we describe the development of humanized mouse models that are susceptible to O. volvulus infection supporting both growth and maturation of the parasite. These novel mouse models have enabled the identification of a number of new O. volvulus biomarkers with potential to play a role in the development of specific and sensitive diagnostic tests for presence of viable parasites.
