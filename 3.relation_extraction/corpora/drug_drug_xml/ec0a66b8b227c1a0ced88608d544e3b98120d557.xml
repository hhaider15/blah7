  <chunk id="ec0a66b8b227c1a0ced88608d544e3b98120d557.c1" text="Objective: This study was designed to estimate the prevalence of E. coli which is the main cause of colisepticemia and the potential risk factors associated with the disease. A total of 74 calves less than 6 months age were selected for this study. For isolation and identification of E. coli, bacterial culture and biochemical tests were used."/>

Higher prevalence of 5 (8.93%) was recorded in Holstein Friesian breed than Boran breed 1 (5.56%). However, breed showed no significant difference on E. coli infections (P &gt; 0.05). Higher prevalence of E. coli revealed below age of 30 days (17.39%) than calves aged between 30 and 90 days (8.33%) and above 90 days (0.00%). However, statistical association showed no difference (P &gt; 0.05). Parity showed a significant difference in prevalence of E. coli (P &lt; 0.05) in which infection increased with number of parity. Sex of the animal showed no association with infection of the calves (P &gt; 0.05). Diarrheic calves showed higher prevalence (33.3%) than non-diarrheic calves (4.62%) with strong statistical association (P &lt; 0.05). The present study showed a high prevalence of septicemic E. coli in the farm and intervention is strongly recommended."/>
