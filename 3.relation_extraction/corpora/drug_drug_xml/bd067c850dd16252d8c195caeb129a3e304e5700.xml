  <chunk id="bd067c850dd16252d8c195caeb129a3e304e5700.c1" text="Here, we report the anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) potency and underlying mechanisms of a Keggin polyoxometalate (PT-1, K 6 HPTi 2 W 10 O 40 ). Our findings showed that PT-1 exhibited highly potent effects against a diverse group of HIV type 1 (HIV-1) strains and displayed low cytotoxicity and genotoxicity. The time-addition assay revealed that PT-1 acted at an early stage of infection, and these findings were supported by the observation that PT-1 had more potency against Env-pseudotyped virus than vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSVG) pseudotyped virus. Surface plasmon resonance binding assays and flow cytometry analysis showed that PT-1 blocked the gp120 binding site in the CD4 receptor. Moreover, PT-1 bound directly to gp41 NHR (N36 peptide), thereby interrupting the core bundle formation of gp41. In conclusion, our data suggested that PT-1 may be developed as a new anti-HIV-1 agent through its effects on entry inhibition.">
