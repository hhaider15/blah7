  <chunk id="853fa72687a51e0a938d05ef0c6c6fde3fbc361f.c3" text="Results: RANTES -28 G allele was associated with SARS susceptibility in Hong Kong Chinese (P &lt; 0.0001, OR = 2.80, 95%CI:2.11-3.71). Individuals with RANTES -28 CG and GG genotypes had a 3.28-fold (95%CI:2.32-4.64) and 3.06-fold (95%CI:1.47-6.39) increased risk of developing SARS respectively (P &lt; 0.0001). This -28 G allele conferred risk of death in a gene-dosage dependent manner (P = 0.014) with CG and GG individuals having a 2.12-fold (95% CI: 1.11-4.06) and 4.01-fold (95% CI: 1.30-12.4) increased risk. For the replication of RANTES data in Beijing Chinese, the -28 G allele was not associated with susceptibility to SARS. However, -28 CG (OR = 4.27, 95%CI:1.64-11.1) and GG (OR = 3.34, 95%CI:0.37-30.7) were associated with admission to intensive care units or death due to SARS (P = 0.011)."/>
