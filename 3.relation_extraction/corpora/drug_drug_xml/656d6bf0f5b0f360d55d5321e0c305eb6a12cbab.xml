  <chunk id="656d6bf0f5b0f360d55d5321e0c305eb6a12cbab.c1" text="Background: The interplay between IFN-γ, IL-17 and neutrophils during CNS inflammatory disease is complex due to cross-regulatory factors affecting both positive and negative feedback loops. These interactions have hindered the ability to distinguish the relative contributions of neutrophils, Th1 and Th17 cell-derived effector molecules from secondary mediators to tissue damage and morbidity. Methods: Encephalitis induced by a gliatropic murine coronavirus was used as a model to assess the direct contributions of neutrophils, IFN-γ and IL-17 to virus-induced mortality. CNS inflammatory conditions were selectively manipulated by adoptive transfer of virus-primed wild-type (WT) or IFN-γ deficient (GKO) memory CD4 + T cells into infected SCID mice, coupled with antibody-mediated neutrophil depletion and cytokine blockade.">

In contrast to recipients of WT CD4 + T cells, extensive neutrophil infiltration and IL-17 expression within the CNS in recipients of GKO CD4 + T cells provided a model to directly assess their contribution(s) to disease. Recipients of WT CD4 + T cells depleted of IFN-γ did not express IL-17 and were spared from mortality despite abundant CNS neutrophil infiltration, indicating that mortality was not mediated by excessive CNS neutrophil accumulation. By contrast, IL-17 depletion rescued recipients of GKO CD4 + T cells from rapid mortality without diminishing neutrophils or reducing GM-CSF, associated with pathogenic Th17 cells in CNS autoimmune models. Furthermore, co-transfer of WT and GKO CD4 + T cells prolonged survival in an IFN-γ dependent manner, although IL-17 transcription was not reduced."/>

The results also suggest that IFN-γ overrides the detrimental IL-17 effector responses via a mechanism downstream of transcriptional regulation.">
