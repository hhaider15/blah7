  <chunk id="620831ad78fde11d52ab3119bb3a524a8e74628d.c3" text="In vitro, viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus 1 and human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 utilise structures known as virological synapses to aid transmission of viral particles from cell to cell in a process termed trans-infection. The formation of the virological synapse provides a gateway for virus to be transferred between cells avoiding the extracellular space, preventing antibody neutralisation or recognition by complement."/>
