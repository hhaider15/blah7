  <chunk id="89eb2ddb11e00fa7652c170a84d919d2428d90f8.c2" text="We conducted a cohort study in all consecutive adults ventilated for more than 48 hours admitted to a 22-bed medical intensive care unit during a 12-month period. Respiratory samples at the time of intubation were assessed by culture, by indirect immunofluorescence assay or by molecular methods in systematic tracheobronchial aspirates. Patients with a virusnegative respiratory sample at the time of intubation were considered unexposed and served as the control group.">

Rhinovirus was the most commonly isolated virus (42%), followed byherpes simplex virus type 1 (22%) and virus influenza A (16%). In multivariate analysis controlling for the Acute Pathophysiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, patients with respiratory disorder at admission (adjusted odds ratio, 2.1; 95% confidence interval, 0.8-5.1; P = 0.12), with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/asthma patients (adjusted odds ratio, 3.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-6.7; P = 0.01) and with admission between 21 November and 21 March (adjusted odds ratio, 2.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-5.9; P = 0.008) were independently associated with a viruspositive sample. Among the 122 patients admitted with respiratory disorder, a tracheobronchial aspirate positive for respiratory viruses at the time of intubation (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.273; 95% confidence interval, 0.096-0.777; P &lt; 0.006) was independently associated with better survival, controlling for the Simplified Acute Physiology Score II and admission for cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrest. Among the remaining 65 patients, a virus-positive sample on intubation did not predict survival."/>

We suggest, however, that the prognostic value of virus-associated respiratory disorder is better than that of other causes of respiratory disorder.">
