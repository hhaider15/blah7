  <chunk id="9c492e76efc05b17e67a3e09c7e3ac44cca89e29.c1" text="Background: Postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) is an emerging disease in swine. Pigs with PMWS are often infected with a variety of other pathogens, including bacteria, viruses and mycoplasm, in addition to porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2). PCV2 and Haemophilus parasuis serovar 4 (HPS4) coinfection remain epidemic in China."/>

  <chunk id="9c492e76efc05b17e67a3e09c7e3ac44cca89e29.c3" text="Results: All the single infected piglets were transiently bacteremic or viremic. All the PCV2/HPS4 coinfected piglets developed PMWS, characterized by dyspnea, anorexia, prostration and lose weight severely. Co-infection with PCV2 and HPS4 resulted in an increased amount of virus in serum and tissues, presented a slower generation and lower levels of antibodies against PCV2. Co-infection with PCV2 and HPS4 resulted in further reductions in total and differential peripheral blood leukocyte counts. Meantime, PCV2/ HPS4 coinfection potentiated the severity of lung and lymphoid lesions by PCV2-associated, increased the virulence of PCV2-antigen and enhanced the incidence of PMWS in piglets."/>
