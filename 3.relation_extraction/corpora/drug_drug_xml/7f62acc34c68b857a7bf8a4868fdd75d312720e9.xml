  <chunk id="7f62acc34c68b857a7bf8a4868fdd75d312720e9.c1" text="Background: Better understanding the etiology-specific incidence of severe acute respiratory infections (SARIs) in resourcepoor, rural settings will help further develop and prioritize prevention strategies. To address this gap in knowledge, we conducted a longitudinal study to estimate the incidence of SARIs among children in rural Bangladesh."/>

  <chunk id="7f62acc34c68b857a7bf8a4868fdd75d312720e9.c3" text="A study physician collected clinical information and obtained nasopharyngeal swabs from all SARI cases and blood for bacterial culture from those hospitalized. We tested swabs for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza viruses, human metapneumoviruses, adenoviruses and human parainfluenza viruses 1-3 (HPIV) by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. We calculated virus-specific SARI incidence by dividing the number of new illnesses by the person-time each child contributed to the study."/>
