The fold change (in log2) of each GlyGly(K) site is shown on the x-axis, while the statistical significance (-log P value) is shown on the y-axis (FDR=0.05, S=1). From left to right: Listeria infection upregulated 746 sites in wild type animals while 435 sites were downregulated. In Isg15 -/animals Listeria upregulated only 168 sites while 1,137 sites were downregulated. No sites were significantly regulated between uninfected wild type and Isg15 -/mice. Finally, Listeria infection led to 886 upregulated sites in wild type and 54 sites were upregulated in Isg15 -/mice. Raw data are available in the source data file.">
