Each patient in the study was monitored for 11-13 months by standard pulmonary function examination. The examination included monitoring respiratory tract infection symptoms (cough, expectoration or gasping) and vital signs. Long-term changes in symptoms and changes in vital signs were correlated back to and compared with the severity of the initial H1N1 influenza infection."/>
