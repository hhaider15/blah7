The simultaneous quantification of ILTV and IBV antibodies were achieved through the interrogation of microspheres by Luminex 200 detection system. .">

A total of 90 chicken serum samples from a chicken farm were tested by xMAP and ELISA assays. The results showed that the coincidence rates were 84.44 and 100% for ILTV and IBV detection, respectively."/>
