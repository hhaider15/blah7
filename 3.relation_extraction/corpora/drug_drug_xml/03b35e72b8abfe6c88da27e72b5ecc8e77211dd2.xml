Dysbiosis, caused by disruption of the gastrointestinal microbiota, is known to predispose rabbits to rabbit enteritis complex (REC), a major cause of morbidity and mortality. The objectives of this study were to describe the fecal microbiota of domestic rabbits from a variety of settings (commercial meat, companion, laboratory, and shelter) and to identify how factors such as age, season, and routine antimicrobial use affect the fecal microbiota composition.">

In all sample types, the predominant bacterial phylum was Firmicutes. Other commonly identified phyla (composing â‰¥ 1% of the total microbiota composition) were Verrucomicrobia, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes. Significant differences in composition were noted between commercial, companion, laboratory, and shelter rabbit samples for proportions of Verrucomicrobia (P &lt; 0.01), Proteobacteria (P &lt; 0.01), and Lentisphaerae (P = 0.01) within the total microbiota. Within the commercial meat rabbit samples, significant differences between the microbiota composition of growers (n = 42) and does (n = 44) were limited to one unclassified Firmicutes (P = 0.03) and no differences were identified at the phylum level. Significant differences were present between fecal samples taken from rabbits during the summer (n = 44) compared to the winter (n = 42), with Firmicutes (P = 0.04), Verrucomicrobia (P = 0.03), Proteobacteria (P = 0.02), Deinococcus-Thermus (P = 0.04), Armatimonadates (P = 0.003), and Actinobacteria (P = 0.03) forming significantly different proportions of the microbiota. The only significant difference in composition between those farms that routinely reported antimicrobial use and those that did not was in one unclassified Bacteroidetes (P &lt; 0.05) and no differences were identified at the phylum level. Conclusions: Rabbit husbandry and diet, in addition to season, significantly influence the fecal microbiota composition of domestic rabbits, while age of the rabbit post-weaning has minimal impact.">
