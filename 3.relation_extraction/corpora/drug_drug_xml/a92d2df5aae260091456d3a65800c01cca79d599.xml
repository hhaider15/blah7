Neutrophils transmigrated through our model toward airway fluid from children with lower respiratory viral infections coinfected with bacteria had elevated levels of neutrophil activation markers but paradoxically exhibited an inability to kill bacteria and a defective respiratory burst compared with children without bacterial coinfection. The airway fluid from children with bacterial coinfections had higher levels of neutrophil elastase activity, as well as myeloperoxidase levels compared to children without bacterial coinfection. Neutrophils transmigrated into the aspirate fluid from children with bacterial coinfection showed decreased respiratory burst and killing activity against H. influenzae and S. aureus compared to those transmigrated into the aspirate fluid from children without bacterial coinfection. Use of a novel transmigration model recapitulates this pathological phenotype in vitro that would otherwise be impossible in a patient, opening avenues for future mechanistic and therapeutic research."/>

We cannot predict which children will recover quickly versus those who will progress to severe ARDS. No ARDS-specific pharmacological treatments exist, rather treatment is supportive using lung-protective ventilation strategies and the administration of antibiotics for suspected bacterial infection. The study of immune regulation in children is needed because both the lung and immunity are maturing during this critical stage of development and the primary cause of PARDS is direct lung injury due to infection 1,2 .">

In adults with ARDS increased counts of airway neutrophils are associated with more severe lung injury and mortality 3,4 . Airway neutrophils from adults with ARDS have enhanced survival, a primed respiratory burst response, and increased phagocytic capacity 5 . In patients with pulmonary diseases characterized by chronic bacterial infections, such as cystic fibrosis, airway neutrophils inhibit T-cell function via two pathways -by depletion of arginine following degranulation and activation of Arginase-1 (Arg1), and by activation of the programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1)/programmed death-1 (PD-1) axis, resulting in reduced proliferation and impaired effector functions 6-15 . By contrast, pulmonary environmental influence on immune cell regulation is poorly characterized in PARDS due to the lack of a model system able to recapitulate the airway neutrophil phenotype in severe paediatric lung injury.">

Understanding the biology of neutrophils recruited to the lung during PARDS is crucial for advancing prognostication, risk stratification, and development of novel therapeutic strategies for children who progress to severe PARDS. Herein we hypothesized that markers of degranulation on the surface of airway neutrophils and in the cell-free airway fluid within 24-hours of intubation would be associated with bacterial respiratory co-infection. We used an in vitro model based on blood neutrophil transepithelial migration into the airway fluid of endotracheally intubated children with suspected or confirmed lower airway viral infections at risk for progressing to or with PARDS 16 . We hypothesized that neutrophils recruited to the cell-free airway fluid of children with bacterial coinfections would have a defective respiratory burst and ability to kill bacteria compared to children with no bacterial coinfection."/>
