  <chunk id="5813a786b66940f45bd1083081448cc53edcadd4.c1" text="Background: Anatid herpesvirus 1 (AHV-1) is an alphaherpesvirus associated with latent infection and mortality in ducks and geese and is currently affecting the world-wide waterfowl production severely. Here we describe a fluorescent quantitative real-time PCR (FQ-PCR) method developed for fast measurement of AHV-1 DNA based on TaqMan MGB technology.">

The realtime PCR was reproducible, as shown by satisfactory low intra-assay and inter-assay coefficients of variation.">
