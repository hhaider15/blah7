  <chunk id="3e86a490327b0f473d776363d3f2e67ddd04d681.c1" text="Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), a mosquito-borne flavivirus, causes acute encephalitis in humans with high mortality. Not much is known about the interactions between viral and cellular factors that regulate JEV infection. By using a kinase/phosphatase-wide RNAi screening approach, we identified a cell cycle-regulating molecule, checkpoint kinase 2 (CHK2), that plays a role in regulating JEV replication. JEV infection induced G1 arrest and activated CHK2. Inactivation of CHK2 and its upstream ataxia-telangiectasia mutated kinase in JEV-infected cells by using inhibitors reduced virus replication. Likewise, JEV replication was significantly decreased by knockdown of CHK2 expression with shRNA-producing lentiviral transduction. We identified CHK2 as a cellular factor participating in JEV replication, for a new strategy in addressing JEV infection.">
