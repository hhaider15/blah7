  <chunk id="c9b696a38ac25d3289283045ac72c8af370dda7a.c1" text="Newcastle disease virus (NDV) has a devastating impact on poultry production in developing countries. This study examined the transcriptome of tracheal epithelial cells from two inbred chicken lines that differ in NDV susceptibility after challenge with a high-titer inoculum of lentogenic NDV. The Fayoumi line had a significantly lower NDV load postchallenge than the Leghorn line, demonstrating the Fayoumi line's classification as a relatively NDV-resistant breed. Examination of the trachea transcriptome showed a large increase in immune cell infiltration in the trachea in both lines at all times postinfection. The pathways conserved across lines and at all three time points postinfection included iCOS-iCOSL signaling in T helper cells, NF-B signaling, the role of nuclear factor of activated T cells in the regulation of the immune response, calcium-induced T lymphocyte apoptosis, phospholipase C signaling, and CD28 signaling in T helper cells. Although shared pathways were seen in the Fayoumi and Leghorn lines, each line showed unique responses as well. The downregulation of collagen and the activation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 signaling in the Fayoumis relative to the Leghorns at 2 days postinfection may contribute to the resistance phenotype seen in the Fayoumis. This study provides a further understanding of host-pathogen interactions which could improve vaccine efficacy and, in combination with genome-wide association studies, has the potential to advance strategies for breeding chickens with enhanced resistance to NDV.">
