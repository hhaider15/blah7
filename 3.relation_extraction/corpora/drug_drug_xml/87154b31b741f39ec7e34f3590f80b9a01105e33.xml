Materials and Methods: The severity of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) was explored using the IPSS and OABSS questionnaires that were completed by 2.486 subjects (923 males and 1.563 females) aged 60 years and older. Korea Meteorological Administration data was used to determine daily average temperature and daily temperature difference on the interview dates at each site."/>

The mean OABSS and mean age for females was 4.41±3.10 and 73.74±6.03years, respectively. Daily average temperature and daily temperature difference ranged from-3.4-28.3 o C and 2.2-16.9 o C, respectively. Age was a significantly risk factor for IPSS, OABSS, and QoL (P&lt;0.001, &lt;0.001, and 0.005, respectively). After multiple regression analysis, daily average temperatures did not show a statistically significant change in IPSS and OABSS. Only daily temperature differences were associated with male LUTS. Conclusions: While LUTS could be worsened in low temperatures generally, IPSS and OABSS were not affected by daily average temperature conditions. Daily temperature differences may be more influential than daily average temperatures.">
