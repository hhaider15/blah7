  <chunk id="2305cbae32a50cf9923356cd30ca3152944d6d38.c1" text="Synthesis of interferon-b (IFN-b) is an innate response to cytoplasmic infection with bacterial pathogens. Our recent studies showed that Listeria monocytogenes limits immune detection and IFN-b synthesis via deacetylation of its peptidoglycan, which renders the bacterium resistant to lysozyme degradation. Here, we examined signaling requirements for the massive IFN-b production resulting from the infection of murine macrophages with a mutant strain of L. monocytogenes, DpgdA, which is unable to modify its peptidoglycan. We report the identification of unconventional signaling pathways to the IFN-b gene, requiring TLR2 and bacterial internalization. Induction of IFN-b was independent of the Mal/TIRAP adaptor protein but required TRIF and the transcription factors IRF3 and IRF7. These pathways were stimulated to a lesser degree by wild-type L. monocytogenes. They operated in both resident and inflammatory macrophages derived from the peritoneal cavity, but not in bone marrow-derived macrophages. The novelty of our findings thus lies in the first description of TLR2 and TRIF as two critical components leading to the induction of the IFN-b gene and in uncovering that individual macrophage populations adopt different strategies to link pathogen recognition signals to IFN-b gene expression.">
