  <chunk id="abcb3cbc5b6ed2707546a1a22fd81724104416ed.c1" text="Grouper is one of the favorite sea food resources in Southeast Asia. However, the outbreaks of the viral nervous necrosis (VNN) disease due to nervous necrosis virus (NNV) infection have caused mass mortality of grouper larvae. Many aqua-farms have suffered substantial financial loss due to the occurrence of VNN. To better understand the infection mechanism of NNV, we performed the transcriptome analysis of sevenband grouper brain tissue, the main target of NNV infection. After artificial NNV challenge, transcriptome of brain tissues of sevenband grouper was subjected to next generation sequencing (NGS) using an Illumina Hi-seq 2500 system. Both mRNAs from pooled samples of mock and NNV-infected sevenband grouper brains were sequenced. Clean reads of mock and NNV-infected samples were de novo assembled and obtained 104,348 unigenes. In addition, 628 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in response to NNV infection were identified. This result could provide critical information not only for the identification of genes involved in NNV infection, but for the understanding of the response of sevenband groupers to NNV infection.">

They are powerful tools for transcriptome analysis. RNA-Seq by NGS is one of the most useful methods to survey the landscape of a transcriptome since it produces millions of data on gene expression. Numerous novel genes and unraveling expression profiles related phenotypic changes, such as development stages, were identified using RNA-Seq [11, 12] . Several studies using RNA-Seq have reported the immune relevant genes of fish after pathogen challenges. For example, zebrafish (Danio rerio) [13], orange-spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides) [14], large yellow croaker (Pseudosciaena crocea) [15], turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) [16], Japanese sea bass (Lateolabrax japonicus) [17] and common carp (Cyprinus carpio) [18] in response to pathogen challenges have been analyzed.">

We annotated the transcripts using Gene Ontology (GO) and non-redundant (nr) databases of GenBank. In addition, we obtained differential expression genes (DEGs) between sevenband grouper brain infected by NNV and non-infected sevenband grouper brain. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that reports the transcriptome of brain tissue of NNV-infected sevenband grouper by RNA-Seq. Our transcriptome analysis data will provide valuable genomic information to determine the functional roles of these genes related to NNV infection and VNN outbreak in the future."/>
