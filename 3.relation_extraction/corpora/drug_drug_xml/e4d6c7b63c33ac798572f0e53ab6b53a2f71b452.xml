  <chunk id="e4d6c7b63c33ac798572f0e53ab6b53a2f71b452.c1" text="The basic reproduction number, R 0 , a summary measure of the transmission potential of an infectious disease, is estimated from early epidemic growth rate, but a likelihood-based method for the estimation has yet to be developed. The present study corrects the concept of the actual reproduction number, offering a simple framework for estimating R 0 without assuming exponential growth of cases. The proposed method is applied to the HIV epidemic in European countries, yielding R 0 values ranging from 3.60 to 3.74, consistent with those based on the Euler-Lotka equation. The method also permits calculating the expected value of R 0 using a spreadsheet."/>
