  <chunk id="7acba31dde3af3dc1bedbde1c8167ad802fbf43e.c1" text="In the present study, the replication kinetics of nephropathogenic (B1648) and respiratory (Massachusetts-M41) IBV strains were compared in vitro in respiratory mucosa explants and blood monocytes (KUL01 + cells), and in vivo in chickens to understand why some IBV strains have a kidney tropism. B1648 was replicating somewhat better than M41 in the epithelium of the respiratory mucosa explants and used more KUL01 + cells to penetrate the deeper layers of the respiratory tract."/>
