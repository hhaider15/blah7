  <chunk id="dc502e4494d5ef1e5a2f54b5df88e7c391d9a763.c1" text="Cases of acute respiratory tract infection caused by Pteropine orthoreovirus (PRV) of the genus Orthoreovirus (family: Reoviridae) have been reported in Southeast Asia, where it was isolated from humans and bats. It is possible that PRV-associated respiratory infections might be prevalent in Southeast Asia. The clinical course of PRV is not fully elucidated."/>

  <chunk id="dc502e4494d5ef1e5a2f54b5df88e7c391d9a763.c3" text="The intranasal inoculation of BALB/c mice with human-borne PRV caused respiratory infection. In addition, all mice with immunity induced by pre-inoculation with a non-lethal dose of PRV were completely protected against lethal PRV infection. Mice treated with antiserum with neutralizing antibody activity after inoculation with a lethal dose of PRV showed a reduced fatality rate. In this mouse model, bat-borne PRV caused respiratory infection similar to human-borne PRV. PRV caused lethal respiratory disease in an animal model of PRV infection, in which BALB/c mice were used."/>

PRV was shown for the first time to be a causative virus of respiratory disease on the basis of Koch's postulations by the additional demonstration that PRV caused respiratory disease in mice through their intranasal inoculation with PRV."/>
  <chunk id="dc502e4494d5ef1e5a2f54b5df88e7c391d9a763.c5" text="It is assumed that Pteropine orthoreovirus (PRV) is a causative agent of acute respiratory tract infection (RTI) in humans. PRV was isolated from patients and fruit bats in Southeast Asia. Furthermore, the genome of PRV was detected in patients with respiratory symptoms, suggesting that PRV causes RTI in humans. There is a potential for PRV to cause RTIs in tropical or sub-tropical regions in Southeast Asia more widely than thought. The virulence, pathology, and pathogenesis of PRV in BALB/c mice were elucidated in detail. To develop specific countermeasures and prophylactics against PRV infection, an animal model of lethal PRV infection is needed, and we developed such a model using BALB/c mice. This model allows investigation of the pathogenicity of PRV and evaluation of the efficacy of drugs and vaccines and might help to accelerate research on the virology of PRV.">
