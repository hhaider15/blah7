  <chunk id="e0af0e80af8fd724d1a23f90590617d72b452e1b.c1" text="Kawasaki disease (KD) can be associated with concomitant viral or bacterial infections. Children with persistent or recurrent fever 36 hours after the end of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) are considered to be resistant to treatment and are at increased risk for coronary complications. Although concomitant infection does not affect coronary outcome, it is unknown how it influences the response to IVIG treatment."/>

Children with infection had higher C-reactive protein at the time of diagnosis (148 vs 112 mg/L, p = 0.04), and 48 hours after IVIG administration (111 vs 59 mg/L, p = 0.003). Nevertheless, there was no statistically significant difference in the prevalence of coronary complications (Z-score &gt; 2.5) between children with and without concomitant infection (36% vs 39%, p = 0.68).">
