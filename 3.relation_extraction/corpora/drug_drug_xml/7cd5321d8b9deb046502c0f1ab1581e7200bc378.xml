Needle-free delivery of DNA using a CO 2 -powered BiojectorH device was compared to delivery by needle and syringe and evaluated for safety and immunogenicity.">

Equal numbers per assigned schedule had low (#500) or high (.500) reciprocal titers of preexisting Ad5 neutralizing antibody.">

IFN-c ELISpot response rates were 17/19 (89%) for BiojectorH and 13/17 (76%) for N/S delivery at Week 28 (4 weeks post rAd5 boost). The magnitude of ELISpot response was about 3-fold higher in BiojectorH compared to N/S groups. Similar effects on response rates and magnitude were observed for CD8+, but not CD4+ T-cell responses by ICS. Env-specific antibody responses were about 10-fold higher in Biojector-primed subjects.">
