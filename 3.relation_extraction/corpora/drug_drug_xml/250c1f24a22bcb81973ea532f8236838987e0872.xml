  <chunk id="250c1f24a22bcb81973ea532f8236838987e0872.c3" text="We conducted a retrospective study, analyzing the records of all the patients hospitalized between 2005 and 2015 for PM in our institution. We included patients with the diagnostic of PM based on appearance on Gram stain, a positive latex agglutination reaction of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) samples and/or a positive culture for Streptococcus pneumoniae (CSF culture or blood culture and concomitant meningitis). We defined &quot;recurrent meningitis&quot; as at least two episodes of meningitis, separated by a period of at least 4 weeks."/>
  <chunk id="250c1f24a22bcb81973ea532f8236838987e0872.c4" text="We identified a total of 194 PM episodes in 182 patients. Thirty eight (20 %) patients were diagnosed with recurrent meningitis, and they had 93 prior episodes recorded. The majority of patients with recurrent meningitis experienced two meningitis episodes, but we found 3 patients with 7, 11 and 40 recurrent episodes. Nineteen (50 %) patients in recurrent meningitis group and 90 (58 %) in non-recurrent group were men. Median age of patients with recurrent versus non-recurrent meningitis was 29 versus 57 years (p &lt; 0.001). Nine (24 %) patients with recurrent meningitis versus 64 (41 %) patients with non-recurrent meningitis had an underlying immunosuppressive condition (p = 0.02, OR:0.41, 95 % CI:0.18-0.92). The immunosuppression was: diabetes mellitus in 32 (44 %), alcoholism in 19 (26 %), endstage liver disease in 7 (9.5 %) and malignancy, malnutrition, pregnancy, splenectomy and immunosuppressive therapy in 15 (20.5 %). We found dissemination of infection from a contiguous site in 74 (38 %) cases, bone defects and/or CSF leakage in 36 (18.5 %) cases and hematogenous spread in 14 (7.2 %) cases. A cranial bone discontinuity and/or CSF leakage were identified in recurrent versus non-recurrent meningitis in 21 (55 %) versus 15 (10 %) episodes (p &lt; 0.001, OR:14.41, 95 % CI:6.21-33.4). Hematogenous spread was observed only in the non-recurrent meningitis group. In recurrent versus nonrecurrent meningitis, impaired consciousness on admission was noted in 15 (40 %) versus 64 (41 %). We noted one death (2.6 %) among patients with recurrent PM group vs 42 (27 %) in the non-recurrent group (p&lt;0.001, OR:0.07, 95 % CI:0.01-0.5). Death was associated with nonrecurrent meningitis (p &lt; 0.001), contiguous spread (p = 0.014), immunodepression (p = 0.01) and impaired consciousness (p = 0.005)."/>

Mortality of PM was associated with immunosuppression and impaired consciousness, but the small number of deaths in the recurrent group did not allow us to analyses the differences between the two groups."/>
