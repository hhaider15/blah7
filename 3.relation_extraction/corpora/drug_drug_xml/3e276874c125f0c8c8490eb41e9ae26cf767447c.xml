It involves systematic training in the development of a sustained, non-aroused state of attention and clear awareness. Mindfulness is a meditation practice that cultivates paying attention in the present moment, bare of judgment, commentary, and decision. It trains the recognition of automatic reactivity such as habituated patterns of behavior, emotional reactivity, momentary distractions and loss of attention, and thus can attenuate stress reactions and other adverse emotional reactivity. MBSR cultivates awareness, stability, insight and choice. Mindfulness includes working with how one relates to environmental stimuli, one's sensitivity to bodily sensations, breathing, states of mind (thinking and emotions), and habitual patterns of automatic reactivity. MBSR training includes the cultivation of attitudes of self-appreciation, compassion, and empathy."/>
