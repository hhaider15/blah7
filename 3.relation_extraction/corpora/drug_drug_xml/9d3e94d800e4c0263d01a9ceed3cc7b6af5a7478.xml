  <chunk id="9d3e94d800e4c0263d01a9ceed3cc7b6af5a7478.c1" text="Ebola virus disease (EVD), called hemorrhagic fever, is a systemic illness caused by the Ebola virus. EVD infection starts with symptoms such as fever, weakness, headache, myalgia, and pharyngitis (dry phase) after nine days latent period (range, 2 to 21 days), and then vomiting and diarrhea develop (wet phase). Internal and external hemorrhage can be found. The patient may recover, in 10-12 days from the disease onset [1] [2] [3] . EVD is usually transmitted through close contact within 1 m distance involving transfer of bodily fluid; in particular, substantial transmission occurs from dead patients [4, 5] ."/>

Since EVD is transmitted by close contact and have a high mortality, it is not likely to progress into a pandemic, but the location of first outbreak site (the border of 3 countries) and the Western African funeral rituals (embracing or kissing the deceased) made the spread much greater. Moreover, it OBJECTIVES: According to the World Health Organization, there have been frequent reports of Ebola virus disease (EVD) since the 2014 EVD pandemic in West Africa. We aim to estimate the outbreak scale when an EVD infected person arrives in Korea."/>

The expected number of EVD patients and outbreak duration were calculated by stochastic simulation under the scenarios of Best case, Diagnosis delay, and Case missing."/>

With a 6-day delay in diagnosis of the first case, the median number of patients becomes 7, and the maximum, 20. If the first case is missed and the government intervention is not activated until 2 cases of secondary infection occur, the median number of patients is estimated at 15, and the maximum, at 35."/>

Moreover, it is imperative to strengthen the local surveillance system and diagnostic protocols to avoid missing cases of secondary infection."/>
