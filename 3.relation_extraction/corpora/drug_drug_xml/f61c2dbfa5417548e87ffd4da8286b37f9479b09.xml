Treatment efficacy was evaluated by the pruritus index and the CAD Lesion Index (CADLI) test. Safety and adverse effects were determined by injection site reaction, weight, blood chemistry, liver function, and whole blood count.">

The efficacy of the CADLI score and the pruritus index in 12 dogs with atopic dermatitis was statistically significant efficacy. No adverse reactions were observed at the intramuscular application site, or in relation to animal weight, blood cell populations, or liver and renal function.">

As far as we know, this is the first report of the use of multiple intramuscular doses cryopreserved ASCs to treat atopic dermatitis."/>
