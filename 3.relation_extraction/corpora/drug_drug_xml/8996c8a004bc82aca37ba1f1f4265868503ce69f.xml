  <chunk id="8996c8a004bc82aca37ba1f1f4265868503ce69f.c1" text="Background: Beside their established function in shaping cell architecture, some cell polarity proteins were proposed to participate to lymphocyte migration, homing, scanning, as well as activation following antigen receptor stimulation. Although PALS1 is a central component of the cell polarity network, its expression and function in lymphocytes remains unknown. Here we investigated whether PALS1 is present in T cells and whether it contributes to T Cell-Receptor (TCR)mediated activation.">

We further provide evidence that PALS1 depletion selectively hindered TCR-driven activation of the transcription factor NF-kB."/>
