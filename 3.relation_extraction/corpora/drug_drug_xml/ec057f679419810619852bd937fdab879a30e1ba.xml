This study examined Chlamydia trachomatis prevalence and risk factors among a representative sample of 18-49-year-old residents in Hong Kong."/>

A questionnaire on sexual practice and health was conducted, and polymerase chain reaction was used to test the urine for genital chlamydial infection. Invitation letters were sent to the selected households and a team of interviewers were sent to recruit one subject per household. Prevalence data was weighted according to the 2011 census and risk factors identified through logistic regression."/>

A unique U-shape disease burden was observed with peaks in younger and older (40-49 years) women. Amongst the sexually active women, the risk factors of Chlamydia trachomatis infection PLOS ONE | were: younger age (aOR = 25.4, 95% CI 2.81-230); living alone (aOR = 8.99, 95% CI 1.46-55.40); and, among all the sexually active participants, males (including the male partners of the female participants) who had travelled out of Hong Kong in the previous 12 months had higher risks of infection (aOR = 5.35;. A core-peripheral geographical distribution of Chlamydia trachomatis prevalence was also observed.">
