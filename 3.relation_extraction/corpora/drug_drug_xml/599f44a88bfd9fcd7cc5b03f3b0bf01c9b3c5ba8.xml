  <chunk id="599f44a88bfd9fcd7cc5b03f3b0bf01c9b3c5ba8.c1" text="Background: Accurate knowledge of incubation period is important to investigate and to control infectious diseases and their transmission, however statements of incubation period in the literature are often uncited, inconsistent, and/or not evidence based. Methods: In a systematic review of the literature on five enteric viruses of public health importance, we found 256 articles with incubation period estimates, including 33 with data for pooled analysis."/>
  <chunk id="599f44a88bfd9fcd7cc5b03f3b0bf01c9b3c5ba8.c2" text="We fit a log-normal distribution to pooled data and found the median incubation period to be 4.5 days (95% CI 3.9-5.2 days) for astrovirus, 1.2 days (95% CI 1.1-1.2 days) for norovirus genogroups I and II, 1.7 days (95% CI 1.5-1.8 days) for sapovirus, and 2.0 days (95% CI 1.4-2.4 days) for rotavirus."/>
  <chunk id="599f44a88bfd9fcd7cc5b03f3b0bf01c9b3c5ba8.c3" text="Conclusions: Our estimates combine published data and provide sufficient quantitative detail to allow for these estimates to be used in a wide range of clinical and modeling applications. This can translate into improved prevention and control efforts in settings with transmission or the risk of transmission."/>
