Information is available on the presence of infectious bronchitis virus in commercial chicken in parts of Ghana but there is no information on free-range poultry and guinea fowls in the country. Possible IBV infections among free-range chickens and guinea fowls in Abokobi and Frafraha communities in the Ga-East district of the Greater Accra Region of Ghana were investigated using serology and PCR. Blood, tracheal, and cloacal swabs were obtained from 219 free-range chickens and guinea fowls with no respiratory symptoms and no history of IBV vaccination. Sera were evaluated for IBV antibodies by ELISA using commercial IBV test kit from IDEXX, Inc., USA. Swab samples were evaluated for S1 glycoprotein gene by one-step RT PCR. All the swab samples tested negative for IBV. 16% of all tested sera were positive for IBV. IBV seroprevalence in guinea fowls was 0%. 21.2% of sera from local chickens were positive for IBV. The seroprevalence of IBV among local chickens from Frafraha was 30% and that of Abokobi was 7.7%. This study shows exposure of local chickens in the study communities to IBV.">
