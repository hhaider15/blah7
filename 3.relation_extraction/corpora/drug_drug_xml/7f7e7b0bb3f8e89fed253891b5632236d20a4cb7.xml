  <chunk id="7f7e7b0bb3f8e89fed253891b5632236d20a4cb7.c2" text="Nine hundred and twenty Chinese children and adolescents (8 to 16 years) underwent graded cardiopulmonary exercise test on a treadmill until volitional exhaustion. Peak VO 2 was corrected for the effects of body mass by ratio or allometric scaling. Z score equations for predicting peak VO 2 were developed. Correlations between scaled peak VO 2 , z scores, body size and age were tested to examine the effectiveness of the approach."/>

Absolute peak VO 2 significantly increased with age in both sexes (both P&lt;0.05), while ratio-scaled peak VO 2 increased only in males (P&lt;0.05). Allometrically scaled peak VO 2 increased from 11 years in both sexes, plateauing by 12 years in girls and continuing to rise until 15 years in boys. Allometically scaled peak VO 2 was not correlated with body mass, but remained correlated with height and age in all but the older girls. Peak VO 2 z score was not correlated with body mass, height or age."/>

The funder had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, cardiopulmonary fitness, allowing comparisons across ages and sex and will likely provide a better metric for tracking change over time in children and adolescents, regardless of body size and age.">
