Even though few of these children presented with acute paralytic disease, direct causal relationship cannot yet be assumed."/>
  <chunk id="6312f554c8e95f9c8f3b5c0b150d88d35d657ae2.c2" text="Objectives The purposes of this report were to describe the clinical findings of an outbreak of EV-D68 infection in Mexico City and identify the genetic relationship with previously reported strains."/>
  <chunk id="6312f554c8e95f9c8f3b5c0b150d88d35d657ae2.c3" text="Patients/Methods Between September and December 2014, 126 nasopharyngeal samples (NPS) of hospitalized children &lt;15 years of age with ARI were tested for the presence of respiratory viruses using a multiplex RT-qPCR and EV-D68-specific RT-qPCR. Clinical, epidemiological, and demographic data were collected and associated with symptomatology and viral infections. Phylogenetic analyses were performed using VP1 region.">

  <chunk id="6312f554c8e95f9c8f3b5c0b150d88d35d657ae2.c4" text="Results Enterovirus/rhinovirus infection was detected in 40 patients (31Á7%), of which 24 patients were EV-D68-positive. EV-D68 infection prevailed over September and October 2014 and was associated with neutrophilia and lymphopenia, and patients were more likely to develop hypoxemia. Phylogenetic analyses showed that Mexican EV-D68 belongs to the new B1 clade."/>
