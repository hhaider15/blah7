He entered the University of Science and Technology of China when he was only 15 years old. After graduating from college with a major in radioelectronic engineering, Yang entered the Wuhan Institute of Botany of Chinese Academy of Sciences and started from zero knowledge in the field of botany. With his extraordinary talent and sharp thinking, he started to explore the succession and evolution of plants from a mathematical point of view (钟扬,何芳良, 1986). Inspired by &quot;computational physics&quot; and &quot;computational chemistry&quot;, he put forward the notion of &quot;computational biology&quot;, which he dedicated his energy as a future direction. Yang founded the first computational biology lab at the Wuhan Institute of Botany of Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1993 (Fig. 2) ."/>
