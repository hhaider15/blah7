  <chunk id="b1ec83bddfe11fc5f176972ca4ae358b4f46c79f.c1" text="Background: The spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV not only mediates receptor-binding but also induces neutralizing antibodies. We previously identified the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S protein as a major target of neutralizing antibodies in animal models and thus proposed a RBD-based vaccine. However, the antigenicity and immunogenicity of RBD in humans need to be characterized. Results: Two panels of serum samples from recovered SARS patients were included and the antibody responses against the RBD were measured by ELISA and micro-neutralization assays. We found that the RBD of S protein induced potent antibody responses in the recovered SARS patients and RBD-specific antibodies could persist at high titers over three year follow-up. Furthermore, affinity purified anti-RBD antibodies possessed robust neutralizing activity. Conclusion: The RBD of SARS-CoV is highly immunogenic in humans and mediates protective responses and RBDbased vaccines and diagnostic approaches can be further developed.">
