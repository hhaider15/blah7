  <chunk id="4ed62784e978048e7494deb2f61a562c8140067e.c1" text="Background: Sequencing-based detection and characterization of viruses in complex samples can suffer from lack of sensitivity due to a variety of factors including, but not limited to, low titer, small genome size, and contribution of host or environmental nucleic acids. Hybridization-based target enrichment is one potential method for increasing the sensitivity of viral detection via high-throughput sequencing."/>
  <chunk id="4ed62784e978048e7494deb2f61a562c8140067e.c2" text="Results: This study expands upon two previously developed panels of virus enrichment probes (for filoviruses and for respiratory viruses) to include other viruses of biodefense and/or biosurveillance concern to the U.S. Department of Defense and various international public health agencies. The newly expanded and combined panel is tested using carefully constructed synthetic metagenomic samples that contain clinically relevant amounts of viral genetic material. Target enrichment results in a dramatic increase in sensitivity for virus detection as compared to shotgun sequencing, yielding full, deeply covered viral genomes from materials with Ct values suggesting that amplicon sequencing would be likely to fail. Increased pooling to improve cost-and time-effectiveness does not negatively affect the ability to obtain full-length viral genomes, even in the case of co-infections, although as expected, it does decrease depth of coverage."/>
  <chunk id="4ed62784e978048e7494deb2f61a562c8140067e.c3" text="Conclusions: Hybridization-based target enrichment is an effective solution to obtain full-length viral genomes for samples from which virus detection would fail via unbiased, shotgun sequencing or even via amplicon sequencing. As the development and testing of probe sets for viral target enrichment expands and continues, the application of this technique, in conjunction with deeper pooling strategies, could make high-throughput sequencing more economical for routine use in biosurveillance, biodefense and outbreak investigations.">
