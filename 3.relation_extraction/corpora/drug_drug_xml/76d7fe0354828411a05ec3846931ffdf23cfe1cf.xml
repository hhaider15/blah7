  <chunk id="76d7fe0354828411a05ec3846931ffdf23cfe1cf.c1" text="Human coronavirus (CoV) HKU1 is a pathogen causing acute respiratory illnesses and so far little is known about its biology. HKU1 virus uses its S1 subunit C-terminal domain (CTD) and not the N-terminal domain like other lineage A b-CoVs to bind to its yet unknown human receptor. Here we present the crystal structure of HKU1 CTD at 1.9 Ã… resolution. The structure consists of three subdomains: core, insertion and subdomain-1 (SD-1). While the structure of the core and SD-1 subdomains of HKU1 are highly similar to those of other b-CoVs, the insertion subdomain adopts a novel fold, which is largely invisible in the cryo-EM structure of the HKU1 S trimer. We identify five residues in the insertion subdomain that are critical for binding of neutralizing antibodies and two residues essential for receptor binding. Our study contributes to a better understanding of entry, immunity and evolution of CoV S proteins."/>
