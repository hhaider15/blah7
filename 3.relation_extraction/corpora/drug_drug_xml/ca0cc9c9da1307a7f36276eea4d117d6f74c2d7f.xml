  <chunk id="ca0cc9c9da1307a7f36276eea4d117d6f74c2d7f.c1" text="Coronaviruses are a family of large positive-sense RNA viruses that are responsible for a wide range of important veterinary and human diseases. Nsp1 has been shown to have an important role in the pathogenetic mechanisms of coronaviruses in vivo. To assess the function of a relatively conserved domain (LLRKxGxKG) of MHV nsp1, a mutant virus, MHV-nsp1-27D, with a 27 nts (LLRKxGxKG) deletion in nsp1, was constructed using a reverse genetic system with a vaccinia virus vector. The mutant virus had similar growth kinetics to MHV-A59 wild-type virus in 17CI-1 cells, but was highly attenuated in vivo. Moreover, the mutant virus completely protected C57BL/6 mice from a lethal MHV-A59 challenge. To further analyze the mechanism of the attenuation of the mutant virus, changes in reporter gene expression were measured in nsp1-or nsp1-27D-expressing cells; the results showed that nsp1 inhibited reporter gene expression controlled by different promoters, but that this inhibition was reduced for nsp1-27D. The research in vivo and in vitro suggests that the LLRKxGxKG region of nsp1 may play an important role in this process.">
