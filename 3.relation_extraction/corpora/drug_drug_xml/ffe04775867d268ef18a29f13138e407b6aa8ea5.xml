Using a case-control approach, index patients who had probable SARS who subsequently transmitted the disease to at least one other patient were analysed as &quot;cases&quot; against patients with no transmission as &quot;controls&quot;, using multivariate logistic regression analysis."/>

Covariates positively associated with transmission in univariate analysis at p &lt; 0.05 included delay to isolation (Day 7 of illness or later), admission to a non-isolation facility, preexisting chronic respiratory disease and immunosuppressive disease, need for oxygen, shortness of breath, vomiting, and higher lactate dehydrogenase levels and higher neutrophil counts. In the multivariate analysis, only three factors were significant: delay to isolation, admission to a nonisolation facility and higher lactate dehydrogenase levels of &gt;650 IU/L (OR 6.4, 23.8 and 4.7 respectively).">
