Pediatric (&lt;18 years) patients represented 48.2% of the total AT population. More than 99% of the patients underwent the AT procedures as an inpatient intervention. Longitudinal data demonstrated an increasing trend in the pediatric AT rates from 1997 (4.3/100,000) to 2010 (5.7/ 100,000) (p = 0.029). In the adult subgroup, a decreasing prevalence of infectious indications (p = 0.014) coincided with an increasing neoplastic indications (p = 0.001). In the pediatric subgroup, the prevalence of obstructive indications increased (p = 0.002). The logistic regression analyses indicated that the significant factors associated with the changing surgical indications for AT were the age in the adult subgroup and hospital level in the pediatric subgroup."/>
