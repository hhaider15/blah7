Patients had various stages of femoral head necrosis. The differential expression of serum proteins and mRNA from patients with steroid-induced necrosis of the femoral head (SINFH) and healthy volunteers was analyzed by western blot and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QT-PCR). The pathological change in osteocyte necrosis was indicated by hematoxylin and eosin stain and immunohistochemistry.">

QT-PCR showed significantly lower levels of α-2-macroglobulin in the serum of patients with SINFH than in controls (P &lt; 0.05). Immunohistochemical staining and western blotting demonstrated that the expression of α-2-macroglobulin was significantly decreased in the necrotic area of SINFH patients (P &lt; 0.05).">
