In this study, we analyzed type I IFN subtypes for their effect on prophylactic adenovirus-based antiretroviral vaccination of mice against Friend retrovirus (FV) or HIV.">

Only the co-administration of adenoviral vectors encoding IFNα2, IFNα4, IFNα6 and IFNα9 resulted in strongly improved immune protection of vaccinated mice from subsequent FV challenge infection with high control over FV-induced splenomegaly and reduced viral loads. The level of protection correlated with augmented virus-specific CD4 + T cell responses and enhanced antibody titers. Similar results were obtained when mice were vaccinated against HIV with adenoviral vectors encoding HIV Env and Gag-Pol in combination with various type I IFN encoding vectors. Here mainly CD4 + T cell responses were enhanced by IFNα subtypes. Conclusions: Our results indicate that certain IFNα subtypes have the potential to improve the protective effect of adenovirus-based vaccines against retroviruses. This correlated with augmented virus-specific CD4 + T cell and antibody responses. Thus, co-expression of select type I IFNs may be a valuable tool for the development of antiretroviral vaccines.">
