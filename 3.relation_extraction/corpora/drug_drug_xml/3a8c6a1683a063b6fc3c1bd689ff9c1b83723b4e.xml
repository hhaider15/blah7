  <chunk id="3a8c6a1683a063b6fc3c1bd689ff9c1b83723b4e.c1" text="Background Severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) is recognized as an important cause of morbidity, mortality, and hospitalization among children in developing countries. Little is known, however, in tropical countries like Cameroon about the cause and seasonality of respiratory infections, especially in hospitalized settings.Objectives: Our study investigates the viral etiology and seasonality of SARI in hospitalized children in Yaounde, Cameroon."/>
  <chunk id="3a8c6a1683a063b6fc3c1bd689ff9c1b83723b4e.c2" text="Methods Prospective clinic surveillance was conducted to identify hospitalized children aged ≤15 years presenting with respiratory symptoms ≤5-day duration. Demographic and clinical data, and respiratory specimens were collected. Nasopharyngeal samples were tested for 17 respiratory viruses using a multiplex polymerase chain reaction. The viral distribution and demographic data were statistically analyzed."/>

At least one virus was identified in each of 65Á4% children, of which 29Á5% were coinfections; 27Á3% were positive for human adenovirus (hAdV), 13Á2% for human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV), 11Á5% for rhinovirus/enterovirus (RV/EV), 10Á6% for human bocavirus (hBoV), 9Á8% for influenza virus (Inf), 6Á6% for human parainfluenza virus (hPIV), 5Á7% for human coronavirus (hCoV), and 2Á3% for human metapneumovirus (hMPV). While hRSV showed seasonal patterns, hAdV and RV/EV were detected throughout the year and no evident temporal patterns were observed for the remaining viruses."/>

Nevertheless, additional studies evaluating asymptomatic Cameroonian children will be important in understanding the relationship between viral carriage and disease."/>
