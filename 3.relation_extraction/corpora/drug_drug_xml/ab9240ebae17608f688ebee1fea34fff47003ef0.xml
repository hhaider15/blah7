  <chunk id="ab9240ebae17608f688ebee1fea34fff47003ef0.c1" text="Background: This article describes a bibliometric review of the scientific production, geographical distribution, collaboration, impact, and subject area focus of pneumonia research indexed on the Web of Science over a 15-year period. Methods: We searched the Web of Science database using the Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) of &quot;Pneumonia&quot; from January 1, 2001 to December 31, 2015. The only document types we studied were original articles and reviews, analyzing descriptive indicators by five-year periods and the scientific production by country, adjusting for population, economic, and research-related parameters."/>
  <chunk id="ab9240ebae17608f688ebee1fea34fff47003ef0.c2" text="Results: A total of 22,694 references were retrieved. The number of publications increased steadily over time, from 981 publications in 2001 to 1977 in 2015 (R 2 = 0.956). The most productive country was the USA (38.49%), followed by the UK (7.18%) and Japan (5.46%). Research production from China increased by more than 1000%. By geographical area, North America (42.08%) and Europe (40.79%) were most dominant. Scientific production in low-and middle-income countries more than tripled, although their overall contribution to the field remained limited (&lt; 15%). Overall, 18.8% of papers were the result of an international collaboration, although this proportion was much higher in sub-Saharan Africa (46.08%) and South Asia (23.43%). According to the specific MeSH terms used, articles focused mainly on &quot;Pneumonia, Bacterial&quot; (19.99%), followed by &quot;Pneumonia, Pneumococcal&quot; (7.02%) and &quot;Pneumonia, Ventilator-Associated&quot; (6.79%)."/>

About a fifth of all papers reflected international collaborations, and these were most evident in papers from sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia."/>
