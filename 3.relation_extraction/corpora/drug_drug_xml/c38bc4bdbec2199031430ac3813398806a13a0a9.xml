  <chunk id="c38bc4bdbec2199031430ac3813398806a13a0a9.c1" text="In recent years, the outbreak of infectious disease caused by Zika virus (ZIKV) has posed a major threat to global public health, calling for the development of therapeutics to treat ZIKV disease. Here, we have described the different stages of the ZIKV life cycle and summarized the latest progress in the development of small-molecule inhibitors against ZIKV infection. We have also discussed some general strategies for the discovery of small-molecule ZIKV inhibitors.">
