Patients were grouped into: &lt;6 months, 6 months to &lt;5 years, 5-to &lt;10-year and ≥10 years. Complications were classified into neurologic, pulmonary, and other. We also calculated the incidence of hospitalized influenza cases per 100 000 age-related population."/>
  <chunk id="5e3580584a2340a7db087f4115d14f6782e22a36.c3" text="Results: There were a total of 1272 patients with a median age of 37 months. The highest hospitalization rates were in the &lt;6 months age-group. Majority (75.2%) had no comorbidity; 25.6% had complications: neurologic 11.9%, pulmonary 9.6%, other 4.1%. Patients with other complications were older, male, and had the highest influenza B rates and the longest length of stay. Influenza A comprised 76.9% of cases and had higher complication rates especially neurologic, compared to influenza B."/>
