  <chunk id="1c5b9b791b402f44f6229f9d420d6a10dc173d39.c1" text="Herbal formulas from traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) have been extensively used in clinics as effective therapies, but it is still a great challenge to demonstrate the scientific basis for their therapeutic effects at the level of molecular biology. By taking a classic herbal formula (Yu Ping Feng decoction, YPF) as an example, this study developed a novel network pharmacology based method to identify its potential therapeutic targets. First, this study constructed a &quot;targets-(pathways)-targets&quot; (TPT) network in which targets of YPF were connected by relevant pathways; then, this network was decomposed into separate modules with strong internal connections; lastly, the propensity of each module toward different diseases was assessed by a contribution score. On the basis of a significant association between network modules and therapeutic diseases validated by chi-square test (p-value &lt; 0.001), this study identified the network module with the strongest propensity toward therapeutic diseases of YPF. Further, the targets with the highest centrality in this module are recommended as YPF's potential therapeutic targets. By integrating the complicated &quot;multi-targetsmulti-pathways-multi-diseases&quot; relationship of herbal formulas, the method shows promise for identifying its potential therapeutic targets, which could contribute to the modern scientific illustration of TCMs' traditional clinical applications."/>

Owing to the complexity of the constituents in TCMs, reductionism, which individually considers each ingredient, cannot adequately explain the effects generated by an entire formula, and therefore faces several challenges comprehending and illustrating the mechanisms of herbal formulas. With the rapid development of bioinformatics, a combined attempt based on system/network biology and polypharmacology has created a new paradigm called network pharmacology (NP).">
