  <chunk id="d8196519b0be213e70c77973a63cd4a13f5532c3.c1" text="Here we revisit the data of two hospital outbreaks of LF that occurred in Jos, Nigeria in 1970 [1] and in Zorzor, Liberia in 1972 [2] by looking at the e↵ective reproduction number to estimate the severity of the diseases. A description of the Jos outbreak is presented below, while the full networks of contacts of 23 and 11 patients for the two respective outbreaks are presented in Figures 1.A and 1 .B in the main text. For the Jos oubreak, TS is the index case, however other contacts are possible, for example case RA is a member of hospital sta↵. It is likely that this person was a source of exposure to other people working in the hospital, (e.g. the nurse MA and the cleaner AA) or spending a long time in the same ward (e.g. case FT, who was admitted to the ward for chronic renal disease). Extra hospital infections were plausible through case FT."/>

TS was on the ward approximately 2 weeks. Both her new infant and a three year old daughter stayed with her during this period. Shortly after TS's discharge and return to Bassa, her mother and the two children became ill. The daughter died at home."/>
