  <chunk id="d5d7c5ada2462aab2fa09789b1ef5ffe8e7f8d64.c1" text="Background: The incidence of cytomegalovirus (CMV) pneumonia is increasing in patients diagnosed with hematologic malignancies. The utility of CMV-DNA viral load measurement has not been standardized, and viral cut-off values have not been established. This study was designed to investigate the utility of CMV quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) using bronchial washing fluid."/>
  <chunk id="d5d7c5ada2462aab2fa09789b1ef5ffe8e7f8d64.c2" text="Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the microbiologic and pathologic results of bronchial washing fluid and biopsy specimens in addition to the patients' clinical characteristics."/>
  <chunk id="d5d7c5ada2462aab2fa09789b1ef5ffe8e7f8d64.c3" text="Results: A total of 565 CMV qRT-PCR assays were performed using bronchial washing fluid from patients with hematologic malignancies. Among them, 101 were positive for CMV by qRT-PCR; of these, 24 were diagnosed with CMV pneumonia and 70 with CMV infection, and 7 were excluded due to a diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis rather than viral pneumonia. The median CMV load determined by qPCR was 1.8 × 10 5 copies/mL (3.6 10 3 -1.5 × 10 8 ) in CMV pneumonia patients and 3.0 × 10 3 copies/mL (5.0 × 10 2 -1.1 × 10 5 ) in those diagnosed with CMV infection (P &lt; 0.01)."/>

  <chunk id="d5d7c5ada2462aab2fa09789b1ef5ffe8e7f8d64.c5" text="The CMV titers in bronchial washing fluid determined by qRT-PCR differed significantly between patients diagnosed with CMV pneumonia and those with CMV infection. The viral cut-off values in bronchial washing fluid were suggested for the diagnosis of CMV pneumonia, which were different depending on the BMT status."/>
