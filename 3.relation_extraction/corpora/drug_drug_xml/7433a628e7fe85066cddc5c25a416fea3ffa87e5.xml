  <chunk id="7433a628e7fe85066cddc5c25a416fea3ffa87e5.c1" text="Background: Proteolytic processing of the Lassa virus envelope glycoprotein precursor GP-C by the host proprotein convertase site 1 protease (S1P) is a prerequisite for the incorporation of the subunits GP-1 and GP-2 into viral particles and, hence, essential for infectivity and virus spread. Therefore, we tested in this study the concept of using S1P as a target to block efficient virus replication.">

Introduction of the S1P recognition motifs RRIL and RRLL into the reactive center loop of a 1 -antitrypsin resulted in abrogation of GP-C processing by endogenous S1P to a similar level observed in S1P-deficient cells. Moreover, S1P-specific a 1 -antitrypsins significantly inhibited replication and spread of a replication-competent recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus expressing the Lassa virus glycoprotein GP as well as authentic Lassa virus. Inhibition of viral replication correlated with the ability of the different a 1 -antitrypsin variants to inhibit the processing of the Lassa virus glycoprotein precursor.">
