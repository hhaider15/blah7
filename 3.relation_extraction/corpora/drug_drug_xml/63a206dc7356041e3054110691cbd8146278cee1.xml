To effectively study camel traits, a biobank of camel DNA specimens with associated biological information is needed. We examined whole-blood, saliva (buccal swabs), and tail-hair follicle samples to determine which is the best source for establishing a DNA biobank. We inspected five amounts of each of whole-blood, buccal swabs, and tail-hair follicles in nine camels, both qualitatively via gel electrophoresis and quantitatively using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer. We also tested the effects of long term-storage on the quality and quantity of DNA, and measured the rate of degradation, by analyzing three buccal swab samples and 30 tail-hair follicles over a period of nine months. Good quality DNA, in the form of visible large size DNA bands, was extracted from all three sources, for all five amounts. The five volumes of whole-blood samples (20-100μl) provided~0.4-3.6 μg, the five quantities of buccal swabs (1-5) produced 0.1-12 μg, while the five amounts of tail-hair follicles (10-50) resulted in~0.7-25 μg. No differences in the rate of degradation of buccal swab and tail-hair follicle DNA were detected, but there was clearly greater deterioration in the quality of DNA extracted from buccal swabs when compared to tail-hair follicles. We recommend using tail-hair samples for camel DNA biobanking, because it resulted in both an adequate quality and quantity of DNA, along with its ease of collection, transportation, and storage. Compared to its success in studies of other domesticated animals, we anticipate that using~50 tail-hair follicles will provide sufficient DNA for sequencing or SNP genotyping.">

The dromedary camel genome has been sequenced recently [17, 18] , which opens the door to study the camel genomically. The reference camel genome enabled the identification of genes associated with white-spotting coat color [19] , solid coat colors [20] , and &quot;tameness&quot; [21] . The aforementioned studies employed an approach that consists of sequencing candidate genes [22]-this approach is limited in utility and does not allow for exploring the wide-range of camel phenotypes. The candidate gene approach can be applied only when the biology of the phenotype is fully understood and a prior knowledge of candidate genes and their functions is available [22] . A biobank of camel DNA samples, with associated phenotypes, is needed to utilize genome sequencing and SNP genotyping technologies in linkage analyses [23] or genome-wide association studies [24] . Moreover, validating the association and possibly the causation, of the genetic variants of a given phenotype requires genotyping a large number of individuals (positive and negative for the phenotype) and examining the agreement between their genotype and phenotype [25] . This validation method will benefit greatly from a camel DNA biobank.">

DNA biobanking for genetic studies requires careful consideration of the used biological specimens, insofar as their source, and their yielded quality and quantity to enable DNA genotyping and sequencing, as well as their ease of transport, and their amenability for long-term storage prior to DNA extraction. Another important aspect to consider when establishing a DNA biobank, is the depth of the information associated with the samples collected from each specimen. Such information includes age, sex, breed, pedigree information, geographic location, phenotypic attributes (e.g. coat color and texture), morphological measurements (e.g. size and height), and productivity (e.g. milk volume, carcass weight, hide quality). To this effect, we recently developed the data collection and organization application, SamplEase [28] , that aims to expedite the collection of all the necessary information associated with each DNA sample in the envisioned camel biobank.">

We think that for the DNA source to be optimal in camel biobanking, it should have the following attributes: (1) it should be easy and non-invasive to collect, (2) the collection should require no special training, (3) it should neither be pathogenic nor harmful, (4) it should provide adequate DNA quantity and quality, (5) it should be amenable to long-term storage, and (6) it should be easy to transport to the lab and distribute to interested researchers.">
