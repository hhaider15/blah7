  <chunk id="b8e929a5f023a12cfe584678c9dc89cf2b8afc6e.c1" text="Picobirnaviruses (PBVs) are mostly found in animal alimentary samples. In this study, among 576 respiratory specimens from 476 mammals and 100 chickens, genogroup I PBVs were detected in three cattle and three monkeys, and a genogroup II PBV-positive sample was collected from one cattle specimen. More than one PBV sequence type was observed in two and one genogroup I PBV-positive samples from cattle and monkeys, respectively. Twenty-four complete/near-complete segments 2 (nine from respiratory and 15 from alimentary samples) from the cattle and monkey genogroup I PBVs and one complete segment 2 from the cattle genogroup II PBV were sequenced. Similar to other studies, the cattle PBVs also showed a high diversity. In contrast, the monkey PBVs observed in this study were clustered into three distinct clades. Within each clade, all the sequences showed &gt;99% amino acid identities. This unique phenomenon is probably due to the fact that monkeys in our locality reside in separated troops with minimal inter-troop contact.">

By conducting sequence and phylogenetic analyses of RdRp genes, PBVs were classified into genogroups I and II [22, 23] . Recently, it was reported that a third genogroup of PBV, genogroup III, was obtained from invertebrate hosts and differs largely from the PBVs of genogroups I and II [15, 24] . In our recent study in which serial samples from the same animal were collected, we observed that PBV probably evolves through mechanisms similar to other segmented RNA viruses, such as rotaviruses (double-stranded RNA virus) [18] . Rotaviruses evolve through reassortment of their genomes, resulting in enormous diversity [25, 26] . This also contributes to the emergence of new rotavirus strains, resulting in disease outbreaks [25, 26] . However, in a recent study on PBV detected in a marmot of the Qinghai-Tibet plateau, it was found that segmentation-associated motifs were identified in both bi-segmented and unsegmented PBVs. Unsegmented PBVs may undergo genome segmentation at the motif region and convert to segmented PBVs, which represents a unique segmentation mechanism [9].">

However, in two recent studies, PBVs were amplified from &gt;10% and 0.97% of respiratory samples collected from pigs and a human, respectively [27, 28] . Such discoveries have improved our understandings on the tissue tropism of PBVs in the corresponding hosts. We hypothesize that PBVs may also reside in the respiratory tracts of animals other than pigs and humans. To test this hypothesis, we carried out a molecular epidemiology study of PBVs in respiratory samples collected from mammals and poultry. Genome segment 2 sequencing, comparative genomics, and phylogenetic analysis of the PBVs detected in the respiratory and alimentary samples of cattle and monkeys were also performed."/>
