One day old Pekin 6 ducklings (Anas platyrhynchos var. domesticus) and Muscovy ducklings (Cairina moschata) 7 were obtained from commercial sources. Adult 6-7 month old throughbreed ducks (Anas 8 platyrhynchos var. domesticus, &quot;Rouen Claire&quot;) and geese (Anser anser var. domesticus, 9 &quot;Pommeranian goose&quot;) were obtained from a local breeder and tested AIV-seronegative by 10 ELISA (ID-Vet, France) before inoculation. Animal numbers and group assignment are 11 summarized in table S2. Intravenous pathogenicity index testing (IVPI) was done according to 12 standard procedures 1 . Intramuscular pathogenicity index (IMPI) testing in one week old 13 Pekin and Muscovy ducklings followed the procedure of the IVPI in chicken, but with 14 injection of virus into the caudal femoral muscles and subsequent clinical scoring for 10 days. 15 In two subsequent experiments aadult ducks were inoculated oculo-nasally (o.n.) with 10 6 16 TCID 50 of either DE14-H5N8A or DE16-H5N8B. During the first infection experiment geese 17 (n=10) were simultaneously infected with DE14-H5N8A and housed together with inoculated 18 ducks. Virus replication was monitored by pharyngeal-and cloacal-swabs on day 2, 4, 7, 10 19 and 14 and on day 2 and 4 2 animals were sacrificed to investigate birds pathologically."/>

Moderate, subacute necrotizing polioencephalitis with infiltration 213 of phagocytic microglia (arrow). (B) Chicken, 3 dpi., brain. Multiple foci (arrow) of influenza 214 A nucleoprotein-immunoreactive neurons and glial cells. (C) Chicken, 3 dpi., liver. Mild, 215 acute, hepatocellular necrosis (necrotizing hepatitis) characterized by small nests of shrunken 216 hepatocytes with pyknotic and karyorrhectic nuclei (arrow) and few infiltratin heterophils. (D) 217 Chicken, 3 dpi., liver. The influenza A virus-nucleoprotein-immunoreactivity displays a 218 multifocal perivascular (star) and perisinusoidal pattern suggestive of endothelial and / or 219 Kupffer cells and only scant, focal immunoreactive hepatocytes. (E) Chicken, 3 dpi., 220 pancreas. Mild, acute, pancreatic necrosis (necrotizing pancreatitis) characterized by small 221 nests of either swollen and ruptured or shrunken hypereosinophilic exocrine pancreatocytes 222 with pyknotic and karyorrhectic nuclei (arrow). (F) Chicken, 3 dpi., pancreas. Multiple foci 223 (star) of influenza A virus-nucleoprotein-immunoreactive exocrine pancreatocytes. (G) 224 Chicken, 7 dpi., spleen. Severe, acute, lymphatic apoptosis and necrosis characterized by 225 cytoplasmic hypereosinophilia, nuclear pyknosis and karyorrhexis (arrow) within a follicular 226 area (star) of the white pulp.

Especially the follicles (star) of the 227 white pulp are surrounded by a rim of influenza A virus-nucleoprotein-immunoreactive cells 228 interpreted as follicular dendritic cells and macrophages. Furthermore there is faintly 229 immunoreactive debris within the follicles and oligofocal cells interpreted as macrophages / 230 dendritic cells and endothelial cells within both white and red pulp.
