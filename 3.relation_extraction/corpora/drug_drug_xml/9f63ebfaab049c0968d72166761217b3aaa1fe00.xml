We sought to determine whether pneumothoraces are induced by high ventilatory pressure or volume and if they are associated with mortality in mechanically ventilated SARS patients."/>
  <chunk id="9f63ebfaab049c0968d72166761217b3aaa1fe00.c2" text="We conducted a prospective, clinical study. Forty-one mechanically ventilated SARS patients were included in our study. All SARS patients were sedated and received mechanical ventilation in the isolation ICU."/>
  <chunk id="9f63ebfaab049c0968d72166761217b3aaa1fe00.c3" text="The mechanically ventilated SARS patients were divided into two groups either with or without pneumothorax. Their demographic data, clinical characteristics, ventilatory variables such as positive end-expiratory pressure, peak inspiratory pressure, mean airway pressure, tidal volume, tidal volume per kilogram, respiratory rate and minute ventilation and the accumulated mortality rate at 30 days after mechanical ventilation were analyzed. There were no statistically significant differences in the pressures and volumes between the two groups, and the mortality was also similar between the groups. However, patients developing pneumothorax during mechanical ventilation frequently expressed higher respiratory rates on admission, and a lower PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio and higher PaCO 2 level during hospitalization compared with those without pneumothorax.">

These variables signaled a deterioration in respiratory function and could be indicators of developing pneumothorax during mechanical ventilation in the SARS patients. Meanwhile, meticulous respiratory therapy and monitoring were mandatory in these patients. ALI = acute lung injury; APACHE = Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation; ARDS = acute respiratory distress syndrome; FiO 2 = fraction of inspired oxygen; MAP = mean airway pressure; ICU = intensive care unit; PEEP = positive end-expiratory pressure; PIP = peak inspiratory pressure, SARS = severe acute respiratory syndrome.
