Data on protopathy, age, sex, time of pain onset, MRI examination, and initial diagnosis were collected and analyzed.">

Average time to final diagnosis was 199.9 ± 165.8 days (range, 32-762 days). Of the 23 cases, 21 cases complained of discomfort and were misdiagnosed because of a normal initial MRI scan. Twelve hips progressed to collapse and 1 hip received lumbar discectomy when got the final diagnosis. Cases with continuous pain (9/21) presented with pain at a later time than those with intermittent pain (12/21), although the continuous pain cases were diagnosed earlier.">
