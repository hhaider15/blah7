  <chunk id="cf750714decab335f8990db7d0ca100506fa99fa.c1" text="Background: Wild birds are an important but to some extent under-studied reservoir for emerging pathogens. We used unbiased sequencing methods for virus discovery in shorebird samples from the Delaware Bay, USA; an important feeding ground for thousands of migratory birds."/>
  <chunk id="cf750714decab335f8990db7d0ca100506fa99fa.c2" text="Findings: Analysis of shorebird fecal samples indicated the presence of a novel astrovirus and coronavirus. A sanderling sample yielded sequences with distant homology to avian nephritis virus 1, an astrovirus associated with acute nephritis in poultry. A ruddy turnstone sample yielded sequences with homology to deltacoronaviruses."/>
  <chunk id="cf750714decab335f8990db7d0ca100506fa99fa.c3" text="Conclusions: Our findings highlight shorebirds as a virus reservoir and the need to closely monitor wild bird populations for the emergence of novel virus variants."/>
