We report the case of a young postpartum woman, who developed evidence of respiratory failure reaching the point of requiring intubation due to an H1N1 influenza virus infection two days after a caesarean delivery. We emphasize the diagnosis, management, and the outcome focusing on the question &quot;what the care providers, including obstetric health care workers, ought to know?&quot; Diagnostic and management strategy for pregnant or postpartum women with novel influenza A (H1N1) viral infection and increased awareness amongst patients and health care professionals may result in improved survival."/>
