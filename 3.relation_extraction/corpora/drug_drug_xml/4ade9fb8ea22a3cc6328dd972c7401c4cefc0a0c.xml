  <chunk id="4ade9fb8ea22a3cc6328dd972c7401c4cefc0a0c.c1" text="The use of Internet-based systems for infectious disease surveillance has been increasingly explored in recent years. However, few studies have used Internet search query or social media data to monitor spatial and temporal trends of avian influenza in China. This study investigated the potential of using search query and social media data in detecting and monitoring avian influenza A (H7N9) cases in humans in China. We collected weekly data on laboratory-confirmed H7N9 cases in humans, as well as H7N9-related Baidu Search Index (BSI) and Weibo Posting Index (WPI) data in China from 2013 to 2017, to explore the spatial and temporal trends of H7N9 cases and H7N9-related Internet search queries. Our findings showed a positive relationship of H7N9 cases with BSI and WPI search queries spatially and temporally. The outbreak threshold time and peak time of H7N9-related BSI and WPI searches preceded H7N9 cases in most years. Seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) models with BSI (β = 0.008, p &lt; 0.001) and WPI (β = 0.002, p = 0.036) were used to predict the number of H7N9 cases. Regression tree model analysis showed that the average H7N9 cases increased by over 2.4-fold (26.8/11) when BSI for H7N9 was &gt; = 11524. Both BSI and WPI data could be used as indicators to develop an early warning system for H7N9 outbreaks in the future.">

Human cases of H7N9 have had a winter-spring peak with high mortality rates (range: 34-47%) in the past five annual epidemics 2 . After the first H7H9 epidemic began in March 2013, the number of cases gradually decreased during the next three epidemics cycles. However, the epidemic in 2016-2017 was worse with 766 laboratory-confirmed cases observed, which accounted for 49.1% (766/1560) of total H7N9 cases reported from 2013-2017. The median incubation period of H7N9 cases (from exposure to disease onset) was six days 3 and the time from onset to disease confirmation was seven days 4 . After confirmation, the national health system receives the report from the hospital and then carries out measures to control epidemics. Therefore, traditional surveillance systems have a time lag of about two weeks. To prepare for the next epidemic and to provide a timely and effective response, a new approach for achieving near real-time detection of H7N9 cases and even prediction of emerging and spreading infectious outbreaks should be developed. Internet-based surveillance has the potential to achieve these goals."/>

These non-traditional digital data sources include social media, web search engines, and remote sensing. Internet-based disease surveillance has been widely suggested as a potential means to improve infectious disease surveillance 6 . Several infectious disease surveillance systems have been developed using internet search metrics to estimate incidence, including for influenza 7,8 (Google Flu Trends) and dengue 9 (Google Dengue Trends) 10 . Internet search metrics have also been applied in the monitoring and forecasting of emerging and re-emerging infections, including pandemic Ebola 11 and Zika 12 , etc."/>

Baidu is the most widely used search engine in China (approximately 86.7% of internet users in China use Baidu 14 ), and Weibo is the most popular social media site in China 15 . Due to insufficient knowledge of disease symptoms and transmission mechanisms 16 , people may search H7N9-related information online prior to H7N9 season. The variety of online activity could provide additional data sources to public health authorities and governments for detecting and monitoring H7N9 in a timely manner."/>
