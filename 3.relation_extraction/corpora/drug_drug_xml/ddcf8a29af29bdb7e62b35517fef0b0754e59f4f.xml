SCSIO XWS02F40. The structures of the compounds (1-7) were determined by the extensive 1D-and 2D-NMR spectra, and HRESIMS spectrometry. All the compounds were tested for their antiviral (H1N1 and H3N2) activity. Compounds 2 and 3 showed significant activity against H3N2 with the prominent IC 50 values of 6.2˘0.08 and 8.9˘0.3 µM, respectively. In addition, compound 2 also exhibited inhibitory activity against H1N1 with an IC 50 value of 3.5˘1.3 µM.">
