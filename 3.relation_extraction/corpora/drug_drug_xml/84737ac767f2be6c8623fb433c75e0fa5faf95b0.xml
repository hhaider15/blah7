  <chunk id="84737ac767f2be6c8623fb433c75e0fa5faf95b0.c1" text="Recent environmental disasters have revealed the government's limitations in real-time response and mobilization to help the public, especially when disasters occur in large areas at the same time. Therefore, enhancing the ability to prepare for public health emergencies at the grassroots level and extend public health emergency response mechanisms to communities, and even to individual families, is a research question that is of practical significance. This study aimed to investigate mechanisms to determine how media exposure affects individual public health emergency preparedness (PHEP) to environmental disasters; specifically, we examined the mediating role of knowledge and trust in government. The results were as follows: (1) knowledge had a significant mediating effect on the relationship between media exposure and PHEP; (2) trust in government had a significant mediating effect on the relationship between media exposure and PHEP; (3) knowledge and trust in government had significant multiple mediating effects on the relationship between media exposure and PHEP.">
