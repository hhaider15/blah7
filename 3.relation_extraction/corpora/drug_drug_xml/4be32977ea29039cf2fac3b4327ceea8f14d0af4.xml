EBV is associated with a variety of diseases including infectious mononucleosis, lymphoproliferative diseases, malignancies such as Burkitt lymphoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis (RA). EBV in nature infects only humans, but in an experimental setting, a limited species of new-world monkeys can be infected with the virus. Small animal models, suitable for evaluation of novel therapeutics and vaccines, have not been available. Humanized mice, defined here as mice harboring functioning human immune system components, are easily infected with EBV that targets cells of the hematoimmune system. Furthermore, humanized mice can mount both cellular and humoral immune responses to EBV. Thus, many aspects of human EBV infection, including associated diseases (e.g., lymphoproliferative disease, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and erosive arthritis resembling RA), latent infection, and T-cell-mediated and humoral immune responses have been successfully reproduced in humanized mice. Here we summarize recent achievements in the field of humanized mouse models of EBV infection and show how they have been utilized to analyze EBV pathogenesis and normal and aberrant human immune responses to the virus."/>

Abundant knowledge of their genetics promoted their use as a model system. Many human viruses, however, do not infect mice. Although murine viruses such as the mouse herpesvirus 68 (MHV-68) that is related to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), and murine cytomegalovirus (CMV) homologous to human CMV have been considered as models of human viruses, there are considerable diversity in biological activity and pathogenesis between murine and human viruses [1-3]. Introduction of transgenes encoding virus receptors to mice enabled viruses such as adenoviruses [4], measles virus [5], coronavirus [6, 7] , and hepatitis C virus [8], to infect mice, but this approach did not remove the species barrier in many other viruses including human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1). A breakthrough in this issue was brought by the development of the scid-hu thy/liv mouse and the scid-hu PBL mouse in 1988 both of which are based on the C.B-17 scid mouse. Due to a mutation in the gene coding for a subunit of the DNA-dependent protein kinase that is essential for recombination of both the T-cell and B-cell receptor genes, C.B-17-scid mice lack both T and B cells and do not have the ability to reject human tissues and cells [9] . Scid-hu thy/liv mice were prepared by transplanting tissues of human fetal thymus and liver into the renal capsule of C.B-17 scid mice and allowed de novo generation of human T cells including the CD4 + compartment [10] . Scid-hu thy/liv mice were primarily used as an In vivo model of HIV-1 infection that targets mainly CD4 + T cells and monocytes/macrophages. In addition, scid-hu thy/liv mice were used for modeling of human herpesvirus 6 [11], human cytomegalovirus [12], Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) infections [13], measles virus [14] , and varicellazoster virus [15] . Various key features of human HIV-1 infection, including selective depletion of CD4 + T cells, were reproduced in scid-hu thy/liv mice [16] [17] [18] . Scid-hu PBL mice, on the other hand, were prepared by transplanting human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to the peritoneal cavity of C.B-17 scid mice and efficient engraftment of most components of the human immune system including T and B cells was observed [19] . Scid-hu PBL mice were used for modeling of HIV-1, human T-lymphotropic virus 1 (HTLV-1), and EBV infections and recapitulated many features of their pathogenesis [20] [21] [22] [23] . There were, however, limitations in these early-generation humanized mouse models: human lymphocytes generated in scid-hu thy/liv mice did not distribute systemically and therefore intrathymic or intranodal HIV-1 inoculation was necessary and virus infection was mostly confined in the inoculated organs; scid-hu PBL mice were prone to graft versus host disease; both scidhu thy/liv and scid-hu PBL mice did not mount primary immune responses to viruses. These disadvantages were overcome in new-generation humanized mice developed in this decade [24] [25] [26] [27] . New-generation humanized mice were prepared by transplanting human hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) to mice of various severely immunodeficient strains (e.g., NOD/Shi-scid Il2rg null (NOG), Balb/c Rag2 −/− Il2rg −/− (BRG), and NOD/LtSz-scid Il2rg −/− (NSG)) and major components of the human immune system, including T cells, B cells, NK cells, dendritic cells, and monocytes/macrophages, were reconstituted. In one protocol (BLT (bone marrow, liver, thymus) mouse), tissues of human fetal liver and thymus, as well as HSC derived from the same liver were transplanted and enabled proper intrathymic selection of human T cells [26] . These new-generation humanized mice can be infected with EBV [24,26,28-31], HIV-1 [32-36], HTLV-1 [37-39], dengue virus [40,41], herpes simplex">
