To clarify this, we performed a metaanalysis.">

We targeted TGF-b1 SNPs that have been reported by â‰¥3 studies to be included in the current meta-analysis, resulting in only 1 final SNP (rs1800470). The odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated in the models of allele comparison (T vs C), homozygote comparison (TT vs CC), dominant (TT vs TC + CC), recessive (TT + TC vs CC) to evaluate the strength of the associations.">
