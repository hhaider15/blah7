  <chunk id="db12f0dcf2d4d913668f70ce1848c37ae2f31c69.c1" text="In the present study, we evaluated the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of the chemokines IL-8, RANTES, MIG, MCP-1 and IP-10 in 99 children with EV71-related encephalitis and 22 children with febrile convulsion (FC). We found that the concentrations of IL-8, RANTES, MIG and IP-10 were significantly higher in HFMD children with encephalitis compared to patients with FC. Additionally, these four chemokines were dramatically reduced during convalescence. Inversely, the level of MCP-1 was lower in encephalitis patients than FC patients and was not significantly reduced during convalescence. Additionally, MIG was strongly correlated with IP-10 in encephalitis patients. Furthermore, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) of CSF MIG and IP-10 in distinguishing encephalitis from FC were 0.869 and 0.876, and the corresponding sensitivities/specificities were 67.7%/100.0% and 67.7%/95.5%, respectively. In conclusion, our results indicate that chemokines play important roles in the pathogenesis of EV71 infection."/>

Although EV71 infection in most cases is self-limited, it can also induce severe neurological complications, such as aseptic meningitis (AM), encephalitis, brainstem encephalitis (BE), pulmonary edema (PE) and other rarer manifestations 1 . These neurological complications can sometimes lead to permanent neurologic sequelae and even death, and fatal PE or cardiorespiratory failure is thought be the main disease process in fatal cases 1 . It has also been postulated that dysregulation of inflammatory responses and cellular immunity are possibly responsible for this pathogenesis 2-4 . For instance, an in vitro study conducted by Lu et al. showed that EV71 inhibited the cellular type I IFN response by targeting a subunit of the IFN receptor, IFNAR1 2 . An animal study revealed that both the lymphocyte and antibody responses reduced the mortality and tissue viral loads of EV71-infected mice 3 . In a clinical study, it was shown that elevated cytokine production (including IL-10, IL-13 and IFN-γ) and lymphocyte (including CD4 + T cells, CD8 + T cells, natural killer cells) depletion were responsible for EV71 infection 4 . Unfortunately, to date, there is no effective vaccines or therapy available for EV71 infection. Therefore, developing a better understanding of the neuropathogenesis of EV71 infection is of the utmost importance in developing a more effective clinical therapy for treating HMFD patients."/>

The most investigated chemokines belong to the CC and CXC families, which are classified by the relative position of the first consensus cysteines (either separated by a non-conserved amino acid or next to each other). CC chemokines include regulated upon activation normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES, also termed CCL5) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1, also termed CCL2), while interferon-γ-inducible protein 10 (IP-10, also termed CXCL10), monokine induced by IFN-γ (MIG, also termed CXCL9) and interleukin-8 (IL-8, also termed CXCL8) belong to the CXC family 5 . Although they were initially characterized as being important in inflammation by targeting leukocytes, chemokines are now considered to">
