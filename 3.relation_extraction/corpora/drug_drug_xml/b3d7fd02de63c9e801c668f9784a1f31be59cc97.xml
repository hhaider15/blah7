  <chunk id="b3d7fd02de63c9e801c668f9784a1f31be59cc97.c1" text="Background: Taiwan has been considered free from canine parvovirus type 2c (CPV-2c) based on the last report of canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV-2) surveillance. However, since January 2015, the first report of CPV-2c in a puppy has occurred in Taiwan. There is currently limited information about the CPV-2c variant in Taiwan. In the present study, we characterized the previously unidentified CPV-2c variant and investigated the distribution of CPV-2 variants in Taiwan. Methods: During January 2014 to April 2016, fecal or rectal swab samples from 99 dogs with suspected CPV-2 infection in Taiwan were collected. Eighty-eight were identified as being either CPV-2a, âˆ’2b or -2c variants positive by real-time PCR and sequence analysis. Results: Sequence analysis of the 88 isolates confirmed CPV-2c as the dominant variant (54.6 %), followed by CPV-2b (26.1 %) and . Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the recent CPV-2c variants are similar to the Chinese CPV-2c strain but can be considered as novel Asian CPV-2c isolates. Conclusion: The present study provides evidence for the existence of a novel CPV-2c variant in Taiwan."/>
