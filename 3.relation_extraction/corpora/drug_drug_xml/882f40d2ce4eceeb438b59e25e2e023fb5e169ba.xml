  <chunk id="882f40d2ce4eceeb438b59e25e2e023fb5e169ba.c1" text="The disease burden associated with influenza in developing tropical and subtropical countries is poorly understood owing to the lack of a comprehensive disease surveillance system and information-exchange mechanisms. The impact of influenza on outpatient visits, hospital admissions, and deaths has not been fully demonstrated to date in south China."/>
