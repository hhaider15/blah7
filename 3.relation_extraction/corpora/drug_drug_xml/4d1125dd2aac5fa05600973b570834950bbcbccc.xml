  <chunk id="4d1125dd2aac5fa05600973b570834950bbcbccc.c1" text="Our group recently identified 16 genes whose peripheral blood expression levels are differentially regulated in acute ischemic stroke. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the early expression levels of any of these 16 genes are predictive for post-stroke blood brain barrier (BBB) disruption. Transcriptional expression levels of candidate genes were measured in peripheral blood sampled from ischemic stroke patients at emergency department admission, and BBB permeability was assessed at 24 hour follow up via perfusion-weighted imaging. Early heightened expression levels of AKAP7, a gene encoding a protein kinase A-binding scaffolding molecule, were significantly associated with BBB disruption 24 hours post-hospital admission. We then determined that AKAP7 is predominantly expressed by lymphocytes in peripheral blood, and strongly co-expressed with ITGA3, a gene encoding the adhesion molecule integrin alpha 3. Subsequent in vitro experiments revealed that heightened expression of AKAP7 and ITGA3 in primary human lymphocytes is associated with a highly adherent phenotype. Collectively, our results suggest that AKAP7 expression levels may have clinical utility as a prognostic biomarker for post-stroke BBB complications, and are likely elevated early in patients who later develop post-stroke BBB disruption due to the presence of an invasive lymphocyte population in the peripheral blood.">

  <chunk id="4d1125dd2aac5fa05600973b570834950bbcbccc.c2" text="The inflammatory state which persists at the level of the neurovascular unit following ischemic stroke can drive delayed disruption of the blood brain barrier (BBB) within and around the infarcted region. Heightened activity of proteinases disrupt the pericellular junctions of the endothelium and allow for migration of peripheral immune cells into the damaged brain parenchyma; this process inherently compromises the integrity of the BBB and increases the risk of edema and hemorrhagic transformation 1, 2 . By nature, administration of thrombolytic therapies can exacerbate the risk of such adverse events and worsen outcome in patients who develop complications 3-5 . Early identification of patients who are at risk for the development of BBB complications can inform acute clinical decisions regarding thrombolytic intervention, and ultimately improve clinical management and patient outcome 6 . Unfortunately, the diagnostic tools presently available to clinicians to identify patients at risk for post-stroke BBB complications are limited."/>

The intact BBB is largely impermeable to Gd-DTPA, thus, hyperintense post-contrast enhancement of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) space on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) is indicative of BBB disruption 7 . Such post-contrast enhancement has been labeled as hyperintense acute reperfusion injury">
