  <chunk id="f6e29e95c1b0aa88f0ebebc39c62fb3bd461be2f.c1" text="Background: Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a leading cause of hospitalization and mortality in children. Diagnosis remains challenging and there are no reliable tools to objectively risk stratify patients or predict clinical outcomes. Molecular distance to health (MDTH) is a genomic score that measures the global perturbation of the transcriptional profile and may help classify patients by disease severity. We evaluated the value of MDTH to assess disease severity in children hospitalized with CAP."/>
  <chunk id="f6e29e95c1b0aa88f0ebebc39c62fb3bd461be2f.c2" text="Methods: Children hospitalized with CAP and matched healthy controls were enrolled in a prospective observational study. Blood samples were obtained for transcriptome analyses within 24 h of hospitalization. MDTH scores were calculated to assess disease severity and correlated with laboratory markers, such as white blood cell count, c-reactive protein (CRP), and procalcitonin (PCT), and clinical outcomes, including duration of fever and duration of hospitalization (LOS). Univariate and multivariable logistic regression were applied to assess factors associated with LOS and duration of fever after hospitalization.">

Statistical group comparisons identified 6,726 genes differentially expressed in patients with CAP vs. healthy controls (n = 39). Children with confirmed PB had higher MDTH scores than those with RV (p &lt; 0.05) or M. pneumoniae (p &lt; 0.01) detected alone. CRP (r = 0.39, p &lt; 0.0001), PCT (r = 0.39, p &lt; 0.0001), and MDTHs (r = 0.24, p &lt; 0.01) correlated with duration of fever, while only MDTHs correlated with LOS (r = 0.33, p &lt; 0.0001). Unadjusted analyses showed that both higher CRP and MDTHs were associated with longer LOS ( OR 1.04 [1-1.07] and 1.12 [1.04-1.20], respectively), however, only MDTH remained significant when adjusting for other covariates (aOR 1.11 [1.01-1.22]).

This suggests that transcriptional biomarkers may represent a promising approach to assess disease severity in children with CAP."/>
