Therefore, the aims of this study were to identify lncRNAs in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and evaluate their transcriptomic regulation during ISA virus (ISAV) infection, an Orthomyxoviridae virus associated with high mortalities in salmonid aquaculture. Using next-generation sequencing, whole-transcriptome analysis of the Salmo salar response to ISAV infection was performed, identifying 5,636 putative lncRNAs with a mean length of 695 base pairs. The transcriptional modulation evidenced a similar number of differentially expressed lncRNAs in the gills (3,294), head-kidney (3,275), and liver (3,325) over the course of the infection. Moreover, analysis of a subset of these lncRNAs showed the following: (i) Most were similarly regulated in response to ISA virus infection; (ii) The transcript subsets were uniquely modulated in each tissue (gills, liver, and head-kidney); and (iii) A subset of lncRNAs were upregulated for each tissue and time analysed, indicating potential markers for ISAV infection. These findings represent the first discovery of widespread differential expression of lncRNAs in response to virus infection in non-model species, suggesting that lncRNAs could be involved in regulating the host response during ISAV infection."/>

In contrast to protein coding genes, it is possible that the non-coding portion of the genome is related to organism complexity and crucial regulatory processes 3,4 . Traditionally, the regulatory functions of RNA were thought limited to roles as ribosomal, messenger, and transfer RNAs. However, ncRNAs have been classified as housekeeping RNAs, microRNAs, small interfering RNAs, PIWI-interacting RNAs, small ncRNAs (&lt; 200 nucleotides [nt] in length), and long ncRNAs (lncRNAs, &gt; 200 nt in length) 5 .">

This disease, listed by the World Organization for Animal Health, is caused by a negative sense, segmented, single-stranded RNA virus of the Orthomyxoviridae family 23 . This virus family historically consists of five genera (Influenza virus A, B, and C; Isavirus; and Thogotovirus) that differ in their host ranges and transmission routes 24 . Like other Orthomyxoviridae, ISAV mRNAs have capped, heterogeneous 5′ -ends, and, due to a need for capped host nuclear RNAs as primers for mRNA synthesis, synthesis is inhibited by amanitin, a specific inhibitor of cellular RNA polymerase II 25 . The outcome of ISAV infection is determined by a complex interaction between the virus and host, which have been characterized by three, ordered waves of gene expression that produce immediate-early, delayed-early, and late responses, as well as replication of the viral genome 26,27 . However, the molecular mechanisms and transcriptional dynamics behind the host response to ISA infection are still unknown. Next-generation sequencing technologies facilitate rapid and cost-effective deep transcriptome studies in non-model species. Despite expanded data, surprisingly little remains known about how lncRNAs function, how many different types of lncRNAs exist, or even if most lncRNAs are biologically significant.">
