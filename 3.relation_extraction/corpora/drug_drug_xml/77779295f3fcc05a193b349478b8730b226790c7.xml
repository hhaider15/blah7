Methods: Original scientific articles and reviews published from the 22 Arab countries in the category &quot;public, environmental &amp; occupational health&quot; during the study period (1900 -2012) were screened using the ISI Web of Science database. Results: The total number of original and review research articles published in the category of &quot;public, environmental &amp; occupational health&quot; from Arab countries was 4673. Main area of research was tropical medicine (1862; 39.85%). Egypt with 1200 documents (25.86%) ranked first in quantity and ranked first in quality of publications (h-index = 51). The study identified 2036 (43.57%) documents with international collaboration. Arab countries actively collaborated with authors in Western Europe (22.91%) and North America (21.04%).
