  <chunk id="b37857f5ea12c3dadcd0929c3c38720fc8c7d028.c1" text="Dendrolimus punctatus cypovirus (DpCPV), belonging to the genus Cypovirus within the family Reoviridae, is considered the most destructive pest of pine forests worldwide. DpCPV has a genome consisting of 10 linear double-stranded RNA segments. To establish a reverse genetics system, we cloned cDNAs encoding the 10 genomic segments of DpCPV into three reverse genetics vectors in which each segment was transcribed under the control of a T7 RNA polymerase promoter and terminator tagged with a hepatitis delta virus ribozyme sequence. We also constructed a vp80-knockout Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus bacmid to express a T7 RNA polymerase codon-optimized for Sf9 cells. Following transfection of Sf9 cells with the three vectors and the bacmid, occlusion bodies (OBs) with the typical morphology of cypovirus polyhedra were observed by optical microscopy. The rescue system was verified by incorporation of a HindIII restriction enzyme site null mutant of the 9th genomic segment. Furthermore, when we co-transfected Sf9 cells with the reverse genetics vectors, the bacmid, and an additional vector bearing an egfp gene flanked with the 5 and 3 untranslated regions of the 10th genomic segment, aggregated green fluorescence co-localizing with the OBs was observed. The rescued OBs were able to infect Spodopetra exigua larvae, although their infectivity was significantly lower than that of wild-type DpCPV. This reverse genetics system for DpCPV could be used to explore viral replication and pathogenesis and to facilitate the development of novel bio-insecticides and expression systems for exogenous proteins.">
