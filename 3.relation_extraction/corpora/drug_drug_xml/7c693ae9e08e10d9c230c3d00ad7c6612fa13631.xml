  <chunk id="7c693ae9e08e10d9c230c3d00ad7c6612fa13631.c1" text="Mammarenavirusesare single-stranded RNA viruses with a bisegmented ambisense genome. Ingestion has been shown as a natural route of transmission for both Lassa virus (LASV) and Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). Due to the mechanism of transmission, epithelial tissues are among the first host cells to come in contact with the viruses, and as such they potentially play a role in spread of virus to naÃ¯ve hosts. The role of the intestinal epithelia during arenavirus infection remains to be uncharacterized. We have utilized a well-established cell culture model, Caco-2, to investigate the role of intestinal epithelia during intragastric infection. We found that LCMV-Armstrong, LCMV-WE, and Mopeia (MOPV) release infectious progeny via similar patterns. However, the reassortant virus, ML-29, containing the L segment of MOPV and S segment of LASV, exhibits a unique pattern of viral release relative to LCMV and MOPV. Furthermore, we have determined attachment efficacy to Caco-2 cells is potentially responsible for observed replication kinetics of these viruses in a polarized Caco-2 cell model. Collectively, our data shows that viral dissemination and interaction with intestinal epithelia may be host, tissue, and viral specific. Viruses 2018, 10, 75 2 of 15">

Although LASV causes a significant number of deaths, the majority of infections are apparently subclinical, or not severe enough to warrant emergency medical intervention, as over 45% of the population in endemic regions is seropositive for LASV; however, why some of the population develop disease and others do not it is not well understood [9] . Most recently, a study of almost 200 LASV sequences has shown that reservoir-to-human transmission is a primary driving force of LASV epidemics in Western Africa [10] . LASV is carried by its natural host Mastomys natalensis, and it is widely accepted that transmission of LASV to humans likely occurs via the ingestion of contaminated food-stuffs, or by the inhalation of infectious particles [5] . Indeed, an epidemiological study in the Republic of Guinea showed a link between the consumption of contaminated food as a risk for rodent-to-human transmission [11] .">

Currently, there are no clinically approved vaccines for LASV; and the antiviral drug ribavirin is the only treatment available for LASV infection. Nonetheless, caveats to this antiviral strategy/treatment regimen include severe side effects, and the requirement for early administration in order to have positive therapeutic effects [12] . Among limited vaccine candidates, only a LASV/Mopeia (MOPV) reassortant virus, ML-29, has been demonstrated to induce protective immunity against LASV strains from clade IV (Sierra-Leone, Liberia, Republic of Guinea) and clade II (Nigeria) [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . Specifically, ML-29 is composed of the MOPV L segment, a non-pathogenic relative of LASV, and the S segment of LASV [20] . MOPV and ML-29 share the L RNA encoding L protein (RNA polymerase), and Z protein (matrix). Previous studies have determined that the L RNA segment of MOPV is the major factor of ML29 attenuation in vivo. Comparison of the ML-29 L segment with the parental MOPV L segment revealed the presence of numerous point mutations that may contribute to the attenuated phenotype associated with .
