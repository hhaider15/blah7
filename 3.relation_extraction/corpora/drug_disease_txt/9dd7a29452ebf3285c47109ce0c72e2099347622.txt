1|chunk|Evidence suggests that reduced intake of fruit and vegetables may play a critical role in the development of asthma and allergies. The present review aimed to summarize the evidence for the association between fruit and vegetable intake, risk of asthma/wheeze and immune responses. Databases including PubMed, Cochrane, CINAHL and EMBASE were searched up to June 2016. Studies that investigated the effects of fruit and vegetable intake on risk of asthma/wheeze and immune responses were considered eligible (n = 58). Studies used cross-sectional (n = 30), cohort (n = 13), case-control (n = 8) and experimental (n = 7) designs. Most of the studies (n = 30) reported beneficial associations of fruit and vegetable consumption with risk of asthma and/or respiratory function, while eight studies found no significant relationship. Some studies (n = 20) reported mixed results, as they found a negative association between fruit only or vegetable only, and asthma. In addition, the meta-analyses in both adults and children showed inverse associations between fruit intake and risk of prevalent wheeze and asthma severity (p < 0.05). Likewise, vegetable intake was negatively associated with risk of prevalent asthma (p < 0.05). Seven studies examined immune responses in relation to fruit and vegetable intake in asthma, with n = 6 showing a protective effect against either systemic or airway inflammation. Fruit and vegetable consumption appears to be protective against asthma.

2|chunk|Nutrients 2017, 9, 341 2 of 26 asthma exacerbations [4, 5] . The considerable morbidity related to asthma may be ameliorated by addressing modifiable risk factors such as diet [6] . It has been suggested that the increased prevalence of asthma in recent decades may be associated with changes in dietary habits since the 1950s-particularly, deficiency in dietary antioxidants [7] . The Western diet has shifted towards less fruit and vegetables, and high intakes of convenience foods that are low in fibre and antioxidants and rich in saturated fats [8, 9] .

3|chunk|Oxidative stress plays a major role in the pathophysiology of asthma, due to chronic activation of airway inflammatory cells [10] . There is ample evidence that oxidative stress can have various deleterious effects on airway function, including airway smooth muscle contraction, induction of BHR, mucus hypersecretion, epithelial shedding and vascular exudation [11, 12] . Moreover, reactive oxygen species (ROS) can activate transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-B), which results in a cascade of events involving upregulation of the transcription of various inflammatory cytokine genes, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and eventually influx and degranulation of airway neutrophils [8] . Fresh fruit and vegetables provide rich sources of antioxidants and other biologically active substances (such as flavonoids, isoflavonoids and polyphenolic compounds) [12] . Studies have shown that diets with low average consumption of fruit and vegetables play a major role in the development of allergic diseases [1, 7] , and may augment oxidative stress in asthma [13] . Antioxidants can reduce airway inflammation via protecting the airways against oxidants by both endogenous (activated inflammatory cells) and exogenous (such as air pollution, cigarette smoke) sources [7] . Moreover, dietary antioxidants present in fruit and vegetables can scavenge ROS, and thus inhibit NFB-mediated inflammation, while diets low in antioxidants have reduced capacity to respond to oxidative stress [8] .

4|chunk|Currently available asthma medications, such as glucocorticoids, are ineffective in some cases such as viral-induced exacerbations [14] ; and prolonged treatment with these therapeutic agents can result in adverse effects, such as pneumonia, cataracts, and osteoporosis [15] . Therefore, non-pharmacological interventions are required to reduce the burden of asthma in both adults and children. Understanding the roles of dietary nutrients in asthma and asthma-related complications may help in the management of this chronic inflammatory disease. Hence, a systematic review of the intake of fruits and vegetables and their effects on immune responses and asthma risk is of interest. This paper aimed to describe studies investigating the effects of fruit and vegetable consumption on risk of asthma and wheezing and immune responses (including immune responses to virus infection and inflammation) in asthma and wheezing.

5|chunk|Methods

6|chunk|PubMed, Cochrane, CINAHL and EMBASE databases were included in the literature search, which was conducted in June 2016, including all previously published articles. Studies were limited to humans with no language restrictions. Additional studies were identified by hand searching references from the identified studies. See Figure 1 for an example of the search strategy.

7|chunk|Only original studies with the following designs were included: randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental studies, cohort studies, case-control studies, before and after studies, and cross sectional studies. Case studies, case reports, animal studies, opinion papers, in vitro studies and conference abstracts were excluded. Review articles were collected for the purposes of reviewing the reference list and did not contribute to the final number of included studies. The target study population was human of all age, gender or ethnicity, with asthma, wheeze, airway inflammation or other related respiratory symptoms. The exposure of interest was intake of whole or extracted fruit and vegetables. The study outcome measures were respiratory virus infection including human rhinovirus, influenza virus, corona virus and adenovirus; markers of systemic inflammation such as ILs, Nutrients 2017, 9, 341 3 of 26 C-reactive protein, tumour necrosis factor- and intercellular adhesion molecule 1; and related clinical outcomes including respiratory function such as forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), asthma control and symptoms such as dyspnoea, coughing, wheezing and chest tightness. Nutrients 2017, 9, 341 3 of 27 (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), asthma control and symptoms such as dyspnoea, coughing, wheezing and chest tightness.
