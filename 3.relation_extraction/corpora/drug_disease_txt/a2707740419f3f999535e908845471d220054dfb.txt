1|chunk|Cardiovascular disease (CVD) continues to be the leading cause of death in the world. Increased inflammation and an enhanced thrombotic milieu represent two major complications of CVD, which can culminate into an ischemic event. Treatment for these life-threatening complications remains reperfusion and restoration of blood flow. However, reperfusion strategies may result in ischemia-reperfusion injury (I/RI) secondary to various cardiovascular pathologies, including myocardial infarction and stroke, by furthering the inflammatory and thrombotic responses and delivering inflammatory mediators to the affected tissue. Annexin A1 (AnxA1) and its mimetic peptides are endogenous anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving mediators, known to have significant effects in resolving inflammation in a variety of disease models. Mounting evidence suggests that AnxA1, which interacts with the formyl peptide receptor (FPR) family, may have a significant role in mitigating I/RI associated complications. In this review article, we focus on how AnxA1 plays a protective role in the I/R based vascular pathologies.
