1|chunk|Autophagy is an evolutionarily ancient pathway that has been shown to be important in the innate immune defense against several viruses. However, little is known about the regulatory role of autophagy in transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) replication. In this study, we found that TGEV infection increased the number of autophagosome-like double-and single-membrane vesicles in the cytoplasm of host cells, a phenomenon that is known to be related to autophagy. In addition, virus replication was required for the increased amount of the autophagosome marker protein LC3-II. Autophagic flux occurred in TGEV-infected cells, suggesting that TGEV infection triggered a complete autophagic response. When autophagy was pharmacologically inhibited by wortmannin or LY294002, TGEV replication increased. The increase in virus yield via autophagy inhibition was further confirmed by the use of siRNA duplexes, through which three proteins required for autophagy were depleted. Furthermore, TGEV replication was inhibited when autophagy was activated by rapamycin. The antiviral response of autophagy was confirmed by using siRNA to reduce the expression of gene p300, which otherwise inhibits autophagy. Together, the results indicate that TGEV infection activates autophagy and that autophagy then inhibits further TGEV replication.

2|chunk|Coronaviruses are enveloped, positive-stranded RNA viruses belonging to the family Coronaviridae in the order Nidovirales 1 . Coronaviruses are currently assigned to one of four genera on the basis of phylogenetic clustering: alphacoronavirus, betacoronavirus, gammacoronavirus, and deltacoronavirus 2,3 . The representative members in each genus are transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) from alphacoronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS-CoV) from betacoronavirus, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) from gammacoronavirus, and Bulbut-CoV from Deltacoronavirus 4 . Members of this family cause acute and persistent infections and are broadly distributed among mammalian species (including humans) and avian species.

3|chunk|Coronaviruses infections are initiated by the binding of virons to cellular receptors. During infection, coronaviruses replicate in the host cytoplasm, where the viral genome becomes available for translation. The replicative structures of MHV form as double membrane vesicles (DMVs) in the cytoplasm 5-8 . DMVs are usually rare in normal cells, but large numbers of double-membrane structures called autophagosomes are usually induced by activation of the cellular autophagy machinery 9 . This suggests that DMVs induced by coronavirus infection are of autophagic origin. Autophagy is not only a cellular physiological pathway for self-degradation, i.e., a pathway for removal of damaged cellular components and for the degradation of unwanted products, but is also a defense mechanism that protects hosts against infection by bacteria 10 . Over the past several years, there has been a rapid increase in the number of studies, including the members of Togviridae, Picornaviridae, Orthromyxoviridae and et al., see reviews [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] .

4|chunk|The initial research on the coronavirus MHV showed that MHV infection induced autophagy, which is required for formation of DMVs-bound MHV replication complexes 18 . Further work using SARS-CoV and IBV also demonstrated the presence of the autophagosome protein marker LC3 or autophagy-like processes 19,20 . However, the work performed to date has focused mainly on the betacoronaviruses MHV and SARS-CoV and on the gammacoronavirus IBV. The involvement of the autophagy pathway in the replication of alphacoronavirus, like TGEV, remains to be investigated.
