1|chunk|IL-35, a relatively newly discovered cytokine belonging to the larger IL-12 family, shows unique anti-inflammatory properties, believed to be associated with dedicated receptors and signaling pathways. IL-35 plays a pivotal role in the development and the function of both regulatory B (Bregs) and T cells (Tregs). In order to further its therapeutic potential, a dairy Lactococcus lactis strain was engineered to express murine IL-35 (LL-IL35), and this recombinant strain was applied to suppress collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). Oral administration of LL-IL35 effectively reduced the incidence and disease severity of CIA. When administered therapeutically, LL-IL35 abruptly halted CIA progression with no increase in disease severity by reducing neutrophil influx into the joints. LL-IL35 treatment reduced IFN- and IL-17 3.7-and 8.5-fold, respectively, and increased IL-10 production compared to diseased mice. Foxp3 + and Foxp3  CD39 + CD4 + T cells were previously shown to be the Tregs responsible for conferring protection against CIA. Inquiry into their induction revealed that both CCR6 + and CCR6  Foxp3 +or CD39 + CD4 + T cells act as the source of the IL-10 induced by LL-IL35. Thus, this study demonstrates the feasibility and benefits of engineered probiotics for treating autoimmune diseases.
