0	63	73 Meningitis	Disease	DOID_9471

1|chunk|Background: As important regulators of the immune system, the human Fcc receptors (FccRs) have been demonstrated to play important roles in the pathogenesis of various infectious diseases. The aim of the present study was to identify the association between FCGR polymorphisms and cryptococcal meningitis.

2|chunk|Methodology/Principal Findings: In this case control genetic association study, we genotyped four functional polymorphisms in low-affinity FccRs, including FCGR2A 131H/R, FCGR3A 158F/V, FCGR3B NA1/NA2, and FCGR2B 232I/T, in 117 patients with cryptococcal meningitis and 190 healthy controls by multiplex SNaPshot technology. Among the 117 patients with cryptococcal meningitis, 59 had predisposing factors. In patients with cryptococcal meningitis, the FCGR2B 232I/I genotype was over-presented (OR = 1.652, 95% CI [1.02-2.67]; P = 0.039) and the FCGR2B 232I/T genotype was underpresented (OR = 0.542, 95% CI [0.33-0.90]; P = 0.016) in comparison with control group. In cryptococcal meningitis patients without predisposing factors, FCGR2B 232I/I genotype was also more frequently detected (OR = 1.958, 95% CI [1.05-3.66]; P = 0.033), and the FCGR2B 232I/T genotype was also less frequently detected (OR = 0.467, 95% CI [0.24-0.91]; P = 0.023) than in controls. No significant difference was found among FCGR2A 131H/R, FCGR3A 158F/V, and FCGR3B NA1/NA2 genotype frequencies between patients and controls.

3|chunk|Conclusion/Significance: We found for the first time associations between cryptococcal meningitis and FCGR2B 232I/T genotypes, which suggested that FccRIIB might play an important role in the central nervous system infection by Cryptococcus in HIV-uninfected individuals.
