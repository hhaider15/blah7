1|chunk|To analyze pathogenic species in bats from southeast coastal regions of China, we performed metagenomic sequencing technology for high throughput sequencing of six sentinels from southeast coastal area of China. We obtained 5,990,261 high quality reads from intestine and lung tissue of 235 bats, including 2,975,371 assembled sequences. 631,490 reads predicted overlapping sequences for the open reading frame (ORF), which accounts for 2.37% of all the sequences (15,012/631,490). Further, the acquired virus sequences were classified into 25 viral families, including 16 vertebrate viruses, four plant viruses and five insect viruses. All bat samples were screened by specific PCR and phylogenetic analysis. Using these techniques, we discovered many novel bat viruses and some bat viruses closelyrelated to known human/animal pathogens, including coronavirus, norovirus, adenovirus, bocavirus, astrovirus, and circovirus. In summary, this study extended our understanding of bats as the viral reservoirs. Additionally, it also provides a basis for furher studying the transmission of viruses from bats to humans.

2|chunk|Bats belong to the order Chiroptera, and are the second largest order of mammals after rodents. This order includes 19 families and 962 species distributed across the globe 1 . More than 130 kinds of viruses have been detected in bats, including more than 60 species of zoonotic viruses which are highly pathogenic in humans 2 , such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronavirus (SL-CoV), Ebola virus, Nipah virus, and Hendra virus 3-6 . In 2002, SARS outbreak in China infected more than 8,000 people worldwide and killed at least 800 people. Chinese horseshoe bats were proved to be the natural reservoirs of SARS-CoV and that intermediate hosts may not be necessary for direct human infection by a bat hosting SL-CoV 7 . Similarly, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-associated coronavirus were detected in bats, and required dipeptidyl peptidase 4 cell receptors for its invasion into host cells 8 . It seems likely that bats might act as natural hosts which critical roles in viral iner-host transmission.

In 2010, meta-genomic analysis was conducted for the first time, following the second generation sequencing of oral swab and faecal samples from 41 bats of three common North American bat species. The results showed that sample pools contained strong matches to at least three novel group of CoVs, and large numbers of insect and plant virus sequences were identified 12 . One bat virome analysis conducted by Ge et al. on fecal samples of bats from six locations in China 13 , and 97 contigs were found to be related to eukaryotic viruses, including coronavirus. Then, one bat virome analysis in Myanmar conducted by He et al. has identified many new mammalian viruses of Myanmar bats 14 , showing
