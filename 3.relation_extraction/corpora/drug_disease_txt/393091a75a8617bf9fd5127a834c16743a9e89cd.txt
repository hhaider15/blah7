1|chunk|Although the role of exogenous small interfering RNA (siRNA) and P-element induced wimpy testis (PIWI)-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathways in mosquito antiviral immunity is increasingly better understood, there is still little knowledge regarding the role of mosquito cellular microRNA (miRNA). Identifying direct interactions between the mosquito miRNAs and the RNA genome of arboviruses and choosing the relevant miRNA candidates to explore resulting antiviral mechanisms are critical. Here, we carried out genomic analyses to identify Aedes aegypti miRNAs that potentially interact with various lineages and genotypes of chikungunya, dengue, and Zika viruses. By using prediction tools with distinct algorithms, several miRNA binding sites were commonly found within different genotypes/and or lineages of each arbovirus. We further analyzed those miRNAs that could target more than one arbovirus, required a low energy threshold to form miRNA-viralRNA (vRNA) complexes, and predicted potential RNA structures using RNAhybrid software. We predicted miRNA candidates that might participate in regulating arboviral replication in Ae. aegypti. Even without any experimental validation, which should be done as a next step, this study can shed further light on the role of miRNA in mosquito innate immunity and targets for future studies.

3|chunk|Emerging and reemerging arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) are spreading globally in recent decades [1] . Arboviruses usually have RNA genomes, including positive-strand RNA alphaviruses (genus Alphavirus, family Togaviridae) and flaviviruses (genus Flavivirus, family Flaviviridae) [2]. The evolution of mosquito-borne RNA viruses and the complex interplay between the vector, the host, and the virus can shape arboviral emergence and re-emergence [3, 4] . Infection of the arthropod midgut epithelial cells occurs following ingestion of a viremic blood meal; the ingested virus must disseminate through internal tissues and organs before reaching the salivary glands to be transmitted. Thus the virus has to overcome a series of tissue barriers before being secreted in mosquito saliva when it takes its next blood meal [5] . Each barrier has different tissue-specific immune properties, which, once triggered by viral infection, may affect the mosquito's overall vector competence [6] . Immune responses to arboviruses involve different pathways, but key roles are played by small RNA/RNA interference (RNAi) pathways [7-10], which have been shown to be a major innate antiviral immune response in mosquitoes against arboviruses of all families [11, 12] .

4|chunk|Mosquitoes have three major types of small RNA pathways and associated molecules: the siRNA, piRNA, and miRNA pathways [9, [11] [12] [13] . The siRNA antiviral immunity of mosquitoes was triggered by exogenous long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecules, which are produced during viral replication. These dsRNAs are recognized by several siRNA biogenesis components and processed into predominantly 21 nucleotides (nt) mature viral siRNAs (vsiRNA). These vsiRNAs are loaded into the multi-protein RNA-Induced Silencing Complex (RISC), which contains the endonuclease Argonaute-2 (Ago-2). The viral RNA genome (or mRNA) containing complementary sequence could be targeted by Ago-2, trigger the cleavage of the target RNA and consequently, reduce the virus replication. These results have stressed the role of exogenous RNAi pathway in controlling viral replication [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] .

5|chunk|Accumulating data suggest that the piRNA pathway is also involved in mosquito RNAi antiviral immunity [12, [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] , although the effector and effector mechanism are unclear. piRNAs are 24-30 nt in size and produced in a Dicer-independent manner. piRNA molecules interact with Argonaute-3 (Ago-3) and Piwi proteins in a so-called "ping-pong" mechanism which amplifies these small RNAs [24] . Several studies have identified and characterized viral piRNA (vpiRNA) or piRNA-like small RNAs in mosquitoes or mosquito cells [12, [20] [21] [22] [23] . Nonetheless, it remains unclear if vpiRNAs exert an antiviral activity.

6|chunk|Both siRNA and piRNA antiviral immunity could be triggered by the direct binding of small RNA on the viral RNA genome. Some studies indicated that the miRNA pathway could presumably participate in antiviral responses [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] . The miRNA pathway shares some similarities with the siRNA pathway, but their differences are more significant [9, 11, 32] ; both have nuclear and cytoplasmic phases as the precursor RNAs are produced in the nucleus. The miRNA precursors (pri-miRNAs) originate from independent miRNA genes or mirtrons which are encoded as introns within RNA transcripts. The hairpin-structured pri-miRNAs are processed by the RNase III-type endonuclease Drosha int 70 bp hairpins, which are then cleaved into~20 bp miRNA duplexes by Dicer-1 after being exported from the nucleus into the cytoplasm by Exportin5 [33] [34] [35] . The miRNA duplexes in the cytoplasm are loaded into Ago-1 or Ago-2 proteins in miRNA-induced silencing complexes (miRISCs) according to their different structures [36] [37] [38] . Mainly using residues 2-8 at the 5 end of mature miRNA (seed region), the miRISC uses the guide strand to find complementary RNA sequences, which leads to RNA degradation (carried out by Ago-2), translational inhibition, or both (mediated by other Ago proteins other than Ago-2) [39, 40] . Commonly, animal miRNA binding sites are mainly in the 3 UTR [41], however miRNA binding sites in the 5 UTR or coding regions were also reported and are involved in post-transcriptional gene regulation [42] [43] [44] . The miRNA antiviral immunity in mosquitoes was shown to facilitate the replication of dengue virus (DENV) or West Nile virus (WNV) in mosquitoes or Drosophila cell lines that are deficient in the biogenesis of some miRNA components [45, 46] .
