1|chunk|Genetic decoding is not 'frozen' as was earlier thought, but dynamic. One facet of this is frameshifting that often results in synthesis of a C-terminal region encoded by a new frame. Ribosomal frameshifting is utilized for the synthesis of additional products, for regulatory purposes and for translational 'correction' of problem or 'savior' indels. Utilization for synthesis of additional products occurs prominently in the decoding of mobile chromosomal element and viral genomes. One class of regulatory frameshifting of stable chromosomal genes governs cellular polyamine levels from yeasts to humans. In many cases of productively utilized frameshifting, the proportion of ribosomes that frameshift at a shift-prone site is enhanced by specific nascent peptide or mRNA context features. Such mRNA signals, which can be 5 or 3 of the shift site or both, can act by pairing with ribosomal RNA or as stem loops or pseudoknots even with one component being 4 kb 3 from the shift site. Transcriptional realignment at slippage-prone sequences also generates productively utilized products encoded trans-frame with respect to the genomic sequence. This too can be enhanced by nucleic acid structure. Together with dynamic codon redefinition, frameshifting is one of the forms of recoding that enriches gene expression. Figure 3. Schematic representation of several viral frameshifting cassettes. (A) Retroviral frameshifting with the thickness of the pro and pol ORFs (pink) reflecting frameshift efficiency and the proportion of ribosomes that decode them with respect to zero frame gag (blue). (B) The 1 ribosomal frameshift site in two cardioviruses that yields a transframe encoded protein (pink). The proximity of the Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) shift site to the StopGo is evident and the relevant amino acid sequence is shown in Table 2 . (C) In arteriviruses, 1 ribosomal frameshifting near the end of a long 5 gene, ORF1a, leads a proportion of ribosomes to continue synthesis by decoding a second and also long gene (ORF1b), with the products of both ORFs specifying non-structural polyproteins. At least eight shorter 3 ORFs encode structural proteins. 2 ribosomal frameshifting in a central region of ORF1a causes some ribosomes to access the wholly overlapping +1 frame TF ORF to yield a C-terminal extension to nsp2 (the product liberated by proteolytic cleavage from that region of the polyprotein encoded by ORF1a). This frameshifting is stimulated in trans by virus-encoded nsp1 in complex with poly(C) binding protein (PCBP). (D) Listeria phage PSA. Capsid and tail shaft encoding genes utilize +1 ribosomal frameshifting on a proline codon just 5 of either a stimulatory pseudoknot (capsid) or stop codon (tail shaft).
