1|chunk|Chitosan, which exhibits good biocompatibility, safety, microbial degradation and other excellent performances, has found application in all walks of life. In the field of medicine, usage of chitosan for the delivery of vaccine is favored by a wide range of researchers. However, due to its own natural limitations, its application has been constrained to the beginning of study. In order to improve the applicability for vaccine delivery, researchers have carried out various chemical modifications of chitosan. This review summarizes a variety of modification methods and applications of chitosan and its derivatives in the field of vaccine delivery.
