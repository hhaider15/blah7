1|chunk|In the endgame of global polio eradication, serosurveillance is essential to monitor each country's vulnerability to poliomyelitis outbreaks. Previously, we developed pseudovirus poliovirus (PV) neutralization test (pPNT) with type 1, 2, and 3 PV pseudovirus (PV pv ), which possess a luciferase-

Our results suggest that pPNT with PV pv (Sabin) could serve as an alternative to cPNT and provide a rationale for pPNT threshold values.

RD cells (human rhabdomyosarcoma cells) and HEK293 cells (human embryonic kidney cells) were cultured as monolayers in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% foetal calf serum (FCS).
