1|chunk|Many coronaviruses are capable of interspecies transmission. Some of them have caused worldwide panic as emerging human pathogens in recent years, e.g., severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). In order to assess their threat to humans, we explored to infer the potential hosts of coronaviruses using a dual-model approach based on nineteen parameters computed from spike genes of coronaviruses. Both the support vector machine (SVM) model and the Mahalanobis distance (MD) discriminant model achieved high accuracies in leave-one-out cross-validation of training data consisting of 730 representative coronaviruses (99.86% and 98.08% respectively). Predictions on 47 additional coronaviruses precisely conformed to conclusions or speculations by other researchers. Our approach is implemented as a web server that can be accessed at http://bioinfo.ihb.ac.cn/seq2hosts.

2|chunk|Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) and their determinants have recently attracted substantial scientific and popular attention. Over 75% of EIDs consist of zoonosis 1 . Among these pathogens are a group of viruses that belong to Coronaviridae. Coronaviridae is a family of enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses that are usually characterized by an enveloped, spherical particle with a diameter in the range of 120-160 nm and a crown-like appearance 2 . Coronaviruses usually cause respiratory tract infections, pneumonia, gastroenteritis, epidemic diarrhoea, enteric infections, hepatitis, encephalomyelitis, and kidney failure. Their hosts include humans, porcines, bovines, murines, avians, and other animals. In the past 12 years, two emerging infectious diseases-severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-attacked humans and animals worldwide and caused approximately 774 human deaths and 315 human deaths, respectively (http://www.who.int/csr/sars/ country/table2004_04_21/en/, http://www.who.int/csr/don/2014_07_23_mers/en/). Especially MERS is still persistently bringing human infections and deaths in the outbreak in Korea recently (http://www. who.int/csr/don/19-june-2015-mers-korea/en/). These diseases, which are spread by respiratory means, caused significant panic around the world.

3|chunk|Coronaviruses are currently classified into four major genera or groups: the alpha-coronavirus, the beta-coronavirus, the gamma-coronavirus, and the delta-coronavirus 1-4 . Alpha-coronavirus and beta-coronavirus usually infect mammalians, whereas gamma-coronavirus and delta-coronavirus usually infect birds 5 . Among all proteins encoded by the coronavirus, the spike protein on the virion surface is the most critical protein, as it mediates both cell attachment and membrane fusion; a few nucleotide changes on the spike gene can cause interspecies transmission 6 . The spike protein primarily consists of three segments, i.e., an ectodomain, a transmembrane anchor, and a short intracellular tail. The ectodomain has two subunits for invading hosts: S1 is responsible for binding receptors and S2 is responsible for membrane fusion 7 . A receptor-binding domain (RBD) near the C-terminal of S1 is primarily responsible for receptor recognition. Coronaviruses recognize a variety of molecules as receptors, including proteins, sugars and heparan sulfates on surfaces of host cells 8 . As the spike gene mediates host recognition and
