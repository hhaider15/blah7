1|chunk|Rationale: Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a syndrome that is characterized by an inappropriate hyperinflammatory immune responseprimary, as a consequence of a genetic defect of NK cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes orsecondary, in the progression of infections, rheumatic or autoimmune diseases, malignancies or metabolic diseases.

2|chunk|Patient concerns: We present the case of a secondary HLH due to Streptococcus pneumoniae infection in a splenectomised patient for spherocytosis, a 37-year-old patient who was splenectomised in childhood for spherocytosis, without immuneprophylaxis induced by antipneumococcal vaccine.

3|chunk|Outcomes: He developed a severe pneumococcal sepsis associated with secondary HLH, with unfavorable outcome and death.

4|chunk|Lessons: To our knowledge, just 2 similar cases had been published in the literature, none in which the secondary HLH was the consequence of an invasive pneumococcal infection in a splenectomized patient for spherocytosis, and the association of splenectomy with HLH is surprizin.

5|chunk|Abbreviation: HLH = hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.
