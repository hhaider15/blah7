1|chunk|Since the initial detection of H5N1, a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus, in 1996 in China, numerous HPAI H5 lineages have been classified, and they continue to pose a threat to animal and human health. In this study, we developed a novel primer/probe set that can be employed to simultaneously detect pan-H5 HPAI and two clades, 2.3.2.1 and 2.3.4.4, of H5Nx viruses using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The sensitivity and specificity of these primer sets and probes were confirmed with a number of different subtypes of influenza virus and the H5-HA gene plasmid DNA. In particular, the multiplex RT-qPCR assay was successfully applied to the simultaneous detection of H5 HPAI and different virus clades in clinical field samples from a poultry farm. Therefore, this multiplex assay and a novel detection primer set and probes will be useful for the laboratory diagnosis and epidemiological field studies of different circulating H5 HPAI virus clades in poultry and migratory wild birds.
