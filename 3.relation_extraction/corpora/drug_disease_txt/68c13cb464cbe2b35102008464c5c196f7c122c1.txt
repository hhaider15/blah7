1|chunk|The Collaborative Cross (CC) is a mouse genetic reference population whose range of applications includes quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping. The design of a CC QTL mapping study involves multiple decisions, including which and how many strains to use, and how many replicates per strain to phenotype, all viewed within the context of hypothesized QTL architecture. Until now, these decisions have been informed largely by early power analyses that were based on simulated, hypothetical CC genomes. Now that more than 50 CC strains are available and more than 70 CC genomes have been observed, it is possible to characterize power based on realized CC genomes. We report power analyses from extensive simulations and examine several key considerations: 1) the number of strains and biological replicates, 2) the QTL effect size, 3) the presence of population structure, and 4)
