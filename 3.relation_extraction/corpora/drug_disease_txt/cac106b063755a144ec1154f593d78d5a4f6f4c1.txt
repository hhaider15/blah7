1|chunk|Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) infection causes acute enteritis in swine of all ages, and especially in suckling piglets. Small intestinal inflammation is considered a central event in the pathogenesis of TGEV infections, and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-B) is a key transcription factor in the inflammatory response. However, it is unclear whether NF-B is crucial for inducing inflammation during a TGEV infection. Our results show that NF-B was activated in swine testicular (ST) cells and intestinal epithelial cell lines J2 (IPEC-J2) cells infected with TGEV, which is consistent with the up-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Treatment of TGEV-infected ST cells and IPEC-J2 cells with the NF-B-specific inhibitor caused the down-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, but did not significantly affect TGEV replication. Individual TGEV protein screening results demonstrated that Nsp2 exhibited a high potential for activating NF-B and enhancing the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Functional domain analyzes indicated that the first 120 amino acid residues of Nsp2 were essential for NF-B activation. Taken together, these data suggested that NF-B activation was a major contributor to TGEV infection-induced inflammation, and that Nsp2 was the key viral protein involved in the regulation of inflammation, with amino acids 1-120 playing a critical role in activating NF-B.
