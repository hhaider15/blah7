0|chunk|cells Modulation of Autophagy for Controlling Immunity

1|chunk|Autophagy is an essential process that maintains physiological homeostasis by promoting the transfer of cytoplasmic constituents to autophagolysosomes for degradation. In immune cells, the autophagy pathway plays an additional role in facilitating proper immunological functions. Specifically, the autophagy pathway can participate in controlling key steps in innate and adaptive immunity. Accordingly, alterations in autophagy have been linked to inflammatory diseases and defective immune responses against pathogens. In this review, we discuss the various roles of autophagy signaling in coordinating immune responses and how these activities are connected to pathological conditions. We highlight the therapeutic potential of autophagy modulators that can impact immune responses and the mechanisms of action responsible.

2|chunk|2 of 22 mTORC1 activity during stress or nutrient starvation releases ULK1, initiating autophagy signaling [2] . Activated ULK1 promotes autophagy by subsequently phosphorylating Beclin 1 and activating the VPS34 lipid kinase. The class III phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate kinase family is comprised of several lipid kinases that phosphorylate phosphatidylinositol at the hydroxyl group at position 3 of the inositol ring, producing phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P) [3] . The PI3K complex, which is composed of VPS34 (catalytic subunit), Beclin 1, and ATG14L (ATG14 like protein), can then translocate to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) following activation of the autophagy pathway [3]. PtdIns(3)P produced by the PI3K complex recruit double FYVE(Fab1p/YOTB/Vac1p/EEA1)-containing protein 1 (DFCP1) and WD repeat domain phosphoinositide-interacting (WIPI) family proteins to the ER [4]. DFCP1 promotes the formation of omegasomes (ER-associated -like structures) and WIPI2, which colocalizes with DFCP1, accelerates the development of the omegasome into the autophagosome [7] . WIPI2 directly binds with ATG16L and recruits the ATG12-ATG5-ATG16L complex to the autophagosome formation site [8] . The ATG12-ATG5-ATG16L complex then promotes the addition of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) to the carboxyl terminus of the mammalian paralogues of ATG8 (hereafter referred to as LC3): LC3A, LC3B, LC3C, -aminobutyric acid receptor-associated protein (GABARAP), GABARAP-like 1 (GABARAPL1), and GABARAPL2 [1]. The lipidation of LC3 paralogues leads to the completion of autophagosome formation [9] . For this reason, LC3 is used as a preferred marker for microscopic detection of isolation membranes and autophagosomes, while phosphatidylethanolamine-conjugated LC3 (LC3-II) is used as a marker of autophagic activity [3] . After fusing with a lysosome, the autophagosome matures into an autolysosome, leading to the degradation and digestion of its contents and inner membrane by lysosomal hydrolases [10] .
