1|chunk|Background: Using reverse genetics, we generated a recombinant low-pathogenic LaSota strain Newcastle disease virus (NDV) expressing the glycoprotein (GP) of Ebola virus (EBOV), designated rLa-EBOVGP, and evaluated its biological characteristic in vivo and in vitro. Results: The introduction and expression of the EBOV GP gene did not increase the virulence of the NDV vector in poultry or mice. EBOV GP was incorporated into the particle of the vector virus and the recombinant virus rLa-EBOVGP infected cells and spread within them independently of exogenous trypsin. rLa-EBOVGP is more resistant to NDV antiserum than the vector NDV and is moderately sensitive to EBOV GP antiserum. More importantly, infection with rLa-EBOVGP was markedly inhibited by IPA3, indicating that rLa-EBOVGP uses macropinocytosis as the major internalization pathway for cell entry.
