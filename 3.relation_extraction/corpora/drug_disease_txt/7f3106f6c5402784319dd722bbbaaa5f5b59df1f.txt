1|chunk|Periplasmic c7 type cytochrome A (PpcA) protein is determined in Geobacter sulfurreducens along with its other four homologs (PpcB-E). From the crystal structure viewpoint the observation emerges that PpcA protein can bind with Deoxycholate (DXCA), while its other homologs do not. But it is yet to be established with certainty the reason behind this from primary protein sequence information. This study is primarily based on primary protein sequence analysis through the chemical basis of embedded amino acids. Firstly, we look for the chemical group specific score of amino acids. Along with this, we have developed a new methodology for the phylogenetic analysis based on chemical group dissimilarities of amino acids. This new methodology is applied to the cytochrome c7 family members and pinpoint how a particular sequence is differing with others.
