The genotype and the name of plasmids are indicated in italic. RLuc: Renilla Luciferase; FLuc: Firefly Luciferase; Neo: neomycine resistance gene; EMCV: internal ribosome entry site of the encephalomyocarditis virus; NS: non-structural; C: core; E: envelope; GT: genotype. Supplementary Figure 2: Cellular toxicity of C31 and ALV in Huh7.5 and MRC5 cells. Cellular toxicity of C31 (black circle) and ALV (open triangle) was evaluated in Huh7.5 cells (A) and MRC5 cells (B) by means of a MTT assay.
