1|chunk|Mice were intra-nasally inoculated with influenza A virus (H3N2). Three mice were sacrificed at 9 days prior to inoculation as a control, and then daily from day 0 to day 10 post-inoculation. The time-course was visualized by fitting the observed points to a third-order polynomial. OASL1 is the mouse ortholog of the human OASL gene (Elkhateeb et al., 2016) and was used in this plot.
