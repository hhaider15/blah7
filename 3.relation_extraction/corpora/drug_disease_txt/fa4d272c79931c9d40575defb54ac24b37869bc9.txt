0	15	22 protein	Chemical	CHEBI_16541

1|chunk|The MultiBac baculovirus/insect cell expression vector system was conceived as a user-friendly, modular toolkit for producing multiprotein complexes for structural biology applications. MultiBac has allowed the structure and function of many molecular machines to be elucidated, including previously inaccessible high-value drug targets. More recently, MultiBac developments have shifted to customized baculoviral genomes that are tailored for a range of applications, including synthesizing artificial proteins by genetic code expansion. We review some of these developments, including the ongoing rewiring of the MultiBac system for mammalian applications, notably CRISPR/ Cas9-mediated gene editing.
