1|chunk|We provide evidence that ACE2 cleaves [Pyr 1 ]apelin-13 to [Pyr 1 ]apelin-13 (1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6)(7)(8)(9)(10)(11)(12) and this cleavage product is expressed in human cardiovascular tissues. We have demonstrated biological activity of [Pyr 1 ]apelin-13 (1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6)(7)(8)(9)(10)(11)(12) at the human and rodent apelin receptor in vitro and in vivo. Our data show that reported enhanced ACE2 activity in cardiovascular disease should not significantly compromise the beneficial effects of apelin based therapies for example in PAH.
