1|chunk|The culture supernatants of the emerging Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) were submitted to three temperatures over time and tested for infectivity by TCID 50 method on Vero E6 cells. At 56C, almost 25 minutes were necessary to reduce the initial titre by 4 log 10 . Increasing temperature to 65C had a strong negative effect on viral infectivity as virucidy dropped significantly to 1 minute. On the contrary, no significant decrease in titre was observed after 2 hours at 25C. These data might be useful in establishing biosafety measures in laboratories against MERS-CoV.
