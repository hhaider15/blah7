1|chunk|Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is one of the most common viruses infecting the respiratory tracts of infants. The rapid and sensitive detection of RSV is important to minimize the incidence of infection. In this study, novel monoclonal antibodies (mAbs; B11A5 and E8A11) against RSV nucleoprotein (NP) were developed and applied to develop a rapid fluorescent immunochromatographic strip test (FICT), employing europium nanoparticles as the fluorescent material. For the FICT, the limits of detection of the antigen and virus were 1.25 g/mL and 4.23  10 6 TCID 50 /mL, respectively, corresponding to 4.75  10 6  5.8 10 5 (mean  SD) RNA copy numbers per reaction mixture for RSV NP. A clinical study revealed a sensitivity of 90% (18/20) and specificity of 98.18% (108/110) for RSV detection when comparing the performance to that of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), representing a 15% improvement in sensitivity over the SD Bioline rapid kit. This newly developed FICT could be a useful tool for the rapid diagnosis of RSV infection.
