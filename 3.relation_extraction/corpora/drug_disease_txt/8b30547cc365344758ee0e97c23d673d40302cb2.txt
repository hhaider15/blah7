1|chunk|Interpretation of the distance to the epidemic threshold when  > 0

2|chunk|When there is a small rate at which individuals can be infected from other populations or an environmental source (0 <  1), there is no longer a disease-free equilibrium but the concept of an epidemic threshold is still relevant. One can see from equation (2.6) that Y * is slightly increased by the addition of  to the force of infection. When R 0 is not too close to 1, Y * can be well-approximated by making a linear approximation to the square root function starting at the point where its argument is equal to its first term, which yields

3|chunk|Using this approximation, one can see that when R 0 1, Y * /N 0 scales with . When R 0 1, Y * /N 0 is potentially much larger and effectively independent of . Also, a large epidemic is only possible when R 0 1. Therefore, we can still consider R 0 = 1 as an epidemic threshold for small . To clarify that Y * /N 0 is not too large when R 0  1 we need a second approximation. In this case, Y * /N 0 can be bounded by applying the triangle inequality to obtain

4|chunk|This bound on Y * /N 0 scales with  . Accordingly, Y * /N 0 is intermediate in size to those cases when R 0 is far from 1. Thus, although when  > 0 the model never passes through an epidemic threshold, as R 0 passes through one Y * /N 0 behaves similarly to the case where the model parameters do pass through a threshold point (i.e., when  = 0). Thus it is still of interest to establish how close the parameters are to the point of the epidemic threshold.

5|chunk|We here describe a specific calculation for finding the values of D with which variable i can provide a distance estimate. The main step is to find the set of D for which the lag- autocorrelation of variable i is within of a reference function having the same rate of decay and frequency of oscillation as the autocorrelation of the informative eigendirection. The reference function may differ from the autocorrelation function along the informative eigendirection in its phase angle. We work with the autocorrelation instead of the autocovariance because the autocorrelation always ranges from one to zero, which makes a single choice of correspond to a comparable error for variables with much different variances. To obtain the reference function, we make use of the contribution of the autocovariance along the informative eigendirection to the autocovariance of variable i.
