1|chunk|Transient transfection of pFcRn promoter luciferase report plasmids with overexpression of NF-B p65 transcription factor enhanced the activation of the luciferase report plasmids. We identified four NF-B transcription factor binding sites in the promoter region of this gene using luciferase reporter system, chromatin immunoprecipitation, electromobility shift assay, and supershift analysis. Together, the data provide the first evidence that TGEV infection up-regulates pFcRn expression via activation of NF-B signaling.
