1|chunk|The exact role of CD8 + T cells during Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection has been heavily debated, yet it is generally accepted that CD8 + T cells contribute to protection against Mtb. In this study, however, we show that the Mtb-susceptible CBA/J mouse strain accumulates large numbers of CD8 + T cells in the lung as infection progresses, and that these cells display a dysfunctional and immunosuppressive phenotype (PD-1 + , Tim-3 + , CD122 + ). CD8 + T cell expansions from the lungs of Mtb-infected CBA/J mice were also capable of secreting the immunosuppressive cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10), although in vivo CD8 + T cell depletion did not significantly alter Mtb burden. Further analysis revealed that pulmonary CD8 + T cells from Mtb-infected CBA/J mice were clonally expanded, preferentially expressing T cell receptor (TcR) Vb chain 8 (8.2, 8.3) or Vb 14. Although Vb8 + CD8 + T cells were responsible for the majority of IL-10 production, in vivo depletion of Vb8 + did not significantly change the outcome of Mtb infection, which we hypothesize was a consequence of their dual IL-10/IFN-c secreting profiles. Our data demonstrate that IL-10-secreting CD8 + T cells can arise during chronic Mtb infection, although the significance of this T cell population in tuberculosis pathogenesis remains unclear.
