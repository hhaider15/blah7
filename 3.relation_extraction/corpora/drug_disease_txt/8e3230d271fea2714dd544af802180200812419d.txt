1|chunk|Four new tetromycin derivatives, tetromycins 1-4 and a previously known one, tetromycin B (5) were isolated from Streptomyces axinellae Pol001 T cultivated from the Mediterranean sponge Axinella polypoides. Structures were assigned using extensive 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy as well as HRESIMS analysis. The compounds were tested for

2|chunk|Mar. Drugs 2011, 9 1683 antiparasitic activities against Leishmania major and Trypanosoma brucei, and for protease inhibition against several cysteine proteases such as falcipain, rhodesain, cathepsin L, cathepsin B, and viral proteases SARS-CoV M pro , and PL pro . The compounds showed antiparasitic activities against T. brucei and time-dependent inhibition of cathepsin L-like proteases with K i values in the low micromolar range.
