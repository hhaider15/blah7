1|chunk|The hierarchical clustering tree (HCT) with a dendrogram [1] and the singular value decomposition (SVD) with a dimension-reduced representative map [2] are popular methods for two-way sorting the gene-by-array matrix map employed in gene expression profiling. While HCT dendrograms tend to optimize local coherent clustering patterns, SVD leading eigenvectors usually identify better global grouping and transitional structures.

2|chunk|This study proposes a flipping mechanism for a conventional agglomerative HCT using a rank-two ellipse (R2E, an improved SVD algorithm for sorting purpose) seriation by Chen [3] as an external reference. While HCTs always produce permutations with good local behaviour, the ranktwo ellipse seriation gives the best global grouping patterns and smooth transitional trends. The resulting algorithm automatically integrates the desirable properties of each method so that users have access to a clustering and visualization environment for gene expression profiles that preserves coherent local clusters and identifies global grouping trends.

3|chunk|We demonstrate, through four examples, that the proposed method not only possesses better numerical and statistical properties, it also provides more meaningful biomedical insights than other sorting algorithms. We suggest that sorted proximity matrices for genes and arrays, in addition to the gene-by-array expression matrix, can greatly aid in the search for comprehensive understanding of gene expression structures. Software for the proposed methods can be obtained at

4|chunk|The dendrogram of an agglomerative hierarchical clustering tree (HCT) is constructed through a sequential bottom-up merging of "most similar" sub-nodes. This sequential mechanism guarantees good local grouping structures for permutations generated from rearranging terminal nodes of agglomerative HCTs. For a gene expression data matrix of 517 genes observed in 13 arrays (we use only the first 12 time series arrays, 0 minute to 24 hours) from the time series of serum stimulation of primary human fibroblasts, Eisen et al.

5|chunk|[1] employed the Pearson product moment correlation to measure between-genes and between-arrays association. We adopt the average linkage option in calculating between-cluster relationships. We do not permute the array-array correlation matrix because of the time series nature of the 12 arrays, although the permuted result is identical to the original order for this particular correlation matrix. As illustrated in Figure 1a , an HCT is "grown" on the 517-by-517 correlation matrix for genes. The relative order of the 517 leaves of the dendrogram is then applied to sort the 517 rows/columns (symmetric) of the correlation matrix and the expression profile matrix.
