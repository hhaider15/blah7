0|chunk|Complete Genome Sequence of a Very Virulent Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus Strain, CH/GDGZ/2012, Isolated in Southern China
0	61	69 Diarrhea	Disease	DOID_13250

1|chunk|The classical symptoms of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) are acute diarrhea and dehydration. The isolated porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) CH/GDGZ/2012 strain was obtained from the feces of diseased pigs in 2012 in southern China. We report the complete genome sequence of strain CH/GDGZ/2012, which might be useful for better understanding the molecular characteristics of this virus.
