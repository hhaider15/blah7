1|chunk|We compared the rates of fever in adult subjects with laboratory-confirmed influenza and other respiratory viruses and examined the factors that predict fever in adults. Symptom data on 158 healthcare workers (HCWs) with a laboratory-confirmed respiratory virus infection were collected using standardized data collection forms from three separate studies. Overall, the rate of fever in confirmed viral respiratory infections in adult HCWs was 234% (37/158). Rates varied by virus: human rhinovirus (253%, 19/75), influenza A virus (30%, 3/10), coronavirus (286%, 2/7), human metapneumovirus (286%, 2/7), respiratory syncytial virus (143%, 4/28) and parainfluenza virus (83%, 1/12). Smoking [relative risk (RR) 465, 95% confidence interval (CI) 133-1625] and coinfection with two or more viruses (RR 419, 95% CI 121-1452) were significant predictors of fever. Fever is less common in adults with confirmed viral respiratory infections, including influenza, than described in children. More than 75% of adults with a viral respiratory infection do not have fever, which is an important finding for clinical triage of adult patients with respiratory infections. The accepted definition of 'influenza-like illness' includes fever and may be insensitive for surveillance when high case-finding is required. A more sensitive case definition could be used to identify adult cases, particularly in event of an emerging viral infection.
