1|chunk|The literature review focuses exclusively on articles that dynamically model the epidemiology of pathogens causing both asymptomatic and symptomatic infections. Therefore, PubMed searches were carried out using the search terms "(models, theoretical [MeSH Terms]) AND dynamic* AND (analysis OR mathematic*) AND transmission AND infection* AND (carriage OR carrier* OR asymptomatic* OR coloni*)" identifying 132 articles. Of these, 101 articles were excluded because they were either reviews that did not present novel work, or because they presented either exclusively within-host models, models not incorporating symptomatic hosts, models including pathogen vectors, models where asymptomatic hosts are non-infectious, or statistical models. We then included a further eleven articles identified through manually searching. This left a total of 42 articles presenting 45 models of the transmission of various infectious diseases in the presence of asymptomatic carriers, which are summarised in Figure S1 .
