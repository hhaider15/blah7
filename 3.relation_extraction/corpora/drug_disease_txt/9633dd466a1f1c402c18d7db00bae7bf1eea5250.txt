0	57	69 dengue fever	Disease	DOID_12205

1|chunk|Dengue fever is endemic in tropical and subtropical areas, especially Southeast Asia. International air travel facilitates the spread of dengue across and within borders. To date, no predictive factors have been established for assessing risk of dengue among febrile travelers.

2|chunk|Since 2006, Taiwan has operated a program of infrared thermometer-based non-contact active surveillance at Taoyuan International Airport (TPE). All inbound passengers from dengue-endemic countries who are febrile (tympanic temperature 38C) undergo routine laboratory testing for dengue. We analyzed clinical and epidemiological characteristics of all tested passengers entering Taiwan via TPE in 2011 to identify the predictive factors of dengue infection. 14(12): e0225840. https://doi.org/10.
