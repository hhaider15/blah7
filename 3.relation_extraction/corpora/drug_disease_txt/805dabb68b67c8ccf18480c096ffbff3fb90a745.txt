1|chunk|from three provinces (Ha Noi, Dak Lak, and Dong Thap). The most numerous group (72.8%) corresponded to individuals living on farms, followed by slaughterers (16.3%) and animal health workers (8.5%). Nasal/pharyngeal and rectal swabs were collected from HRSC members at recruitment and after notifying illness. Exposure to exotic animals (including wild pigs, porcupine, monkey, civet, bamboo rat and bat) was highest for the Dak Lak cohort (53.7%), followed by Ha Noi (13.7%) and Dong Thap (4.0%). A total of 26.8% of individuals reported consumption of raw blood over the previous year; 33.6% slaughterers reported no use of protective equipment at work. Over 686 person-years of observation, 213 episodes of suspect infectious disease were notified, equivalent of 0.35 reports per person-year. Responsive samples were collected from animals in the farm cohort. There was noticeable time and space clustering of disease episodes suggesting that the VIZIONS set up is also suitable for the formal epidemiological investigation of disease outbreaks.

2|chunk|Southeast Asia is considered a 'hotspot' for emerging infectious diseases. Over recent years this region (including southeast China) has witnessed the emergence of major outbreaks of severe zoonotic disease such as SARS, nipah virus and avian influenza 1,2 . The region has a higher than average proportion of mortality due to communicable diseases including many zoonoses, antimicrobial-resistant pathogens and vector-borne diseases 3 and remains an epicentre of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) 4 . The reasons for this high incidence of emerging zoonoses in southeast Asia are complex, and likely to include multiple demographic, geographical, climatic, economic and cultural factors as well as agricultural practices that create an environment conducive to the emergence and propagation of zoonotic diseases 5 .

3|chunk|VIZIONS (Vietnam Initiative on Zoonotic InfectIONS) is a multidisciplinary project aiming to understand the emergence of zoonotic viral pathogens in human populations 6 . VIZIONS is performing in-depth comparisons of viromes on both sides of the species barrier (i.e. humans and animals) with concurrent investigation of the behavioural and demographic factors driving pathogen transmission and disease emergence. VIZIONS has two distinct components, one hospital-and one community-based. The hospital-based component aims to identify pathogens that have already crossed the species barrier causing serious infections requiring hospitalization. The community component, termed 'a high-risk sentinel cohort' (HRSC), focuses on individuals perceived to be at particularly high risk of infection with zoonotic pathogens because of their occupational or residential exposure 6 . These cohorts include people living on farms (including farms raising non-domestic or 'exotic species' -termed 'exotic animal farms'), slaughterers (pigs and poultry), animal health workers, restaurant workers and rat traders.

4|chunk|Farmers represent the most common population subgroup, since 68% of the Vietnamese population is rural (GSO, 2013), and small-scale animal farming represents a common source of livelihood in rural settings. The HRSC studies primarily aim at detecting viruses involved in episodes of milder disease (i.e. not requiring hospitalization) by simultaneous co-sampling of humans and animals as close as possible to the date of onset of disease and characterize the major risks associated with exposure to animals and consumption of animal food. Sampling in the HSRC and hospital components overlap in space and time to ensure that pathogens discovered in one study population can be investigated in the other.

5|chunk|Recruitment for the VIZIONS HRSC was initiated in March 2013, and by September 2014 HRSC studies were established in three provinces of Vietnam (Dong Thap, Ha Noi and Dak Lak), all with differing human and geographical landscapes (the Mekong Delta, the Red River Delta, the Central Highlands, respectively). The aims of this report are: (a) To describe the methodologies used for recruitment of HRSC members and associated data collection; (b) to describe the demographic characteristics and high-risk exposures (i.e. contact with animals, slaughtering and consumption) among the HRSC members across the three provinces; and (c) to provide a current update report on the episodes of clinical disease reported.
