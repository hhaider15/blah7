1|chunk|Biological mass spectrometry has evolved as a core analytical technology in the last decade mainly because of its unparalleled ability to perform qualitative as well as quantitative profiling of enormously complex biological samples with high mass accuracy, sensitivity, selectivity and specificity. Mass spectrometry-based techniques are also routinely used to assess glycosylation and other post-translational modifications, disulfide bond linkage, and scrambling as well as for the detection of host cell protein contaminants in the field of biopharmaceuticals. The role of mass spectrometry in vaccine development has been very limited but is now expanding as the landscape of global vaccine development is shifting towards the development of recombinant vaccines. In this review, the role of mass spectrometry in vaccine development is presented, some of the ongoing efforts to develop vaccines for diseases with global unmet medical need are discussed and the regulatory challenges of implementing mass spectrometry techniques in a quality control laboratory setting are highlighted.
