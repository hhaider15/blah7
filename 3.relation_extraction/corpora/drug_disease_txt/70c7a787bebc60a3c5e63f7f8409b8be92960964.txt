1|chunk|2-Benzoylamino-N-phenyl-benzamide derivatives (5a-h) were prepared from 2-phenyl-3,1-(4H)-benzoxazin-4-one 3 and substituted anilines 4a-h in the presence of a Keggin-type heteropolyacids series (H 3 PW 12 O 40 13H 2 O; H 4 SiW 12 O 40 13H 2 O; H 4 SiMo 12 O 40 13H 2 O; and H 3 PMo 12 O 40 13H 2 O) as catalysts without solvent and under microwave irradiation. We found that the use of H 3 PW 12 O 40 13H 2 O acid coupled to microwave irradiation allowed obtaining a high-yielding reaction with a short time. The compound structures were established by 1 H-NMR and 13 C-NMR. The antibacterial and antifungal activities of the synthesized compounds exhibited an inhibition of the growth of bacteria and fungi.
