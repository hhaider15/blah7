1|chunk|Influenza viruses may cause severe human infections leading to hospitalization or death. Linear regression models were fitted to population-based data on hospitalizations and deaths. Surveillance data on influenza virus activity permitted inference on influenza-associated hospitalizations and deaths. The ratios of these estimates were used as a potential indicator of severity. Influenza was associated with 431 (95% CrI: 358-503) respiratory deaths and 12,700 (95% CrI: 11,700-13,700) respiratory hospitalizations per year. Majority of the excess deaths occurred in persons 65 y of age.
