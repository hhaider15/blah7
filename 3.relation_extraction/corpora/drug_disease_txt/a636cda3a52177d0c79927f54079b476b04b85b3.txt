1|chunk|RNA viruses replicate with low fidelity due to the error-prone nature of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which generates approximately one mutation per round of genome replication. Due to the large population sizes produced by RNA viruses during replication, this results in a cloud of closely related virus variants during host infection, of which small increases or decreases in replication fidelity have been shown to result in virus attenuation in vivo, but not typically in vitro. Since the discovery of the first RNA virus fidelity mutants during the mid-aughts, the field has exploded with the identification of over 50 virus fidelity mutants distributed amongst 7 RNA virus families. This review summarizes the current RNA virus fidelity mutant literature, with a focus upon the definition of a fidelity mutant as well as methods to confirm any mutational changes associated with the fidelity mutant. Due to the complexity of such a definition, in addition to reports of unstable virus fidelity phenotypes, the future translational utility of these mutants and applications for basic science are examined.

3|chunk|The mutational spectrum for an RNA virus can be visualized as a 3D field, with multiple peaks and valleys representative of virus fitness (Figure 1) . The virus consensus sequence forms the foundation of the fitness landscape, allowing the virus population to explore this landscape through genetic drift with the prospect of finding and climbing new fitness peaks [15] . This landscape is not fixed but changes throughout the viral lifecycle, with the magnitude, location, and frequency of the peaks and valleys moving through both time and space [13, 16] . Due to the high error rates produced during RNA virus replication, it is hypothesized that the best strategy for RNA virus survival is to produce a sequence foundation composed of low rolling hills, termed survival of the flattest [17, 18] . Thus, mutations away from the consensus sequence should not have large, detrimental effects as the sequence space is explored, but still allow for the virus to identify fitness peaks to aid in survival during an unstable environment. However, survival is not guaranteed, and the mechanisms that allow for the ubiquity of RNA viruses can also be used against them.
