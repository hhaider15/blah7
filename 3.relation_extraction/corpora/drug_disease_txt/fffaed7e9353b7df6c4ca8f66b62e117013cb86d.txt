1|chunk|In many infectious diseases caused by either viruses or bacteria, pathogen glycoproteins play important roles during the infection cycle, ranging from entry to successful intracellular replication and host immune evasion. Dengue is no exception. Dengue virus glycoproteins, envelope protein (E) and non-structural protein 1 (NS1) are two popular sub-unit vaccine candidates. E protein on the virion surface is the major target of neutralizing antibodies. NS1 which is secreted during DENV infection has been shown to induce a variety of host responses through its binding to several host factors. However, despite their critical role in disease and protection, the glycosylated variants of these two proteins and their biological importance have remained understudied. In this review, we seek to provide a comprehensive summary of the current knowledge on protein glycosylation in DENV, and its role in virus biogenesis, host cell receptor interaction and disease pathogenesis.

2|chunk|Dengue Dengue (DEN) is an emerging arthropod-borne infectious disease which is caused by DENV. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) (2017), DEN cases have continually increased in recent decades. An estimation of DEN infections worldwide has indicated up to 50-100 million cases per year (WHO, 2017). The virus is transmitted primarily by female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in tropical and subtropical regions. The spread of DEN in non-tropical areas has been associated to the transmission by the secondary vector, A. albopictus mosquito which is able to withstand winter temperature (Gould et al., 2010) . Four serotypes of DENV (DENV1-4) have been identified to date and co-circulation of these serotypes has been reported in Asia, Africa, and America (Guzman et al., 2010) .
