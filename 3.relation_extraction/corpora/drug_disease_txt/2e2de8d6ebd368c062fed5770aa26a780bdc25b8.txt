1|chunk|Background: Cytokines play important roles in antiviral action. We examined whether polymorphisms of IFN-,TNF- and IL-10 affect the susceptibility to and outcome of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).

2|chunk|A case-control study was carried out in 476 Chinese SARS patients and 449 healthy controls. We tested the polymorphisms of IFN-,TNF- and IL-10 for their associations with SARS.

2	173	177 SARS	Disease	DOID_2945

3|chunk|Results: IFN- +874A allele was associated with susceptibility to SARS in a dose-dependent manner (P < 0.001). Individuals with IFN- +874 AA and AT genotype had a 5.19-fold (95% Confidence Interval [CI], 2.78-9.68) and 2.57-fold (95% CI, 1.35-4.88) increased risk of developing SARS respectively. The polymorphisms of IL-10 and TNF- were not associated with SARS susceptibility.

4|chunk|Conclusion: IFN- +874A allele was shown to be a risk factor in SARS susceptibility.
