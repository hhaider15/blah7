1|chunk|The relationship between females with low glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity level (LG6PD) and HBV infection is unclear. We conducted a cross sectional study of 124 406 reproductive-age Chinese females who participated in the National Free Pre-conception Check-up Projects to investigate the risk of HBV infection among females with LG6PD and its effect on liver enzyme. Based on HBV serological test results, the participants were divided into the susceptible, immunized, and HBV infected groups. The multivariable-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for HBV infection in LG6PD participants were 1.71 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.45-2.01) and 1.41 (95% CI: 1.23-1.62), respectively with the susceptible and immunized participants as references, compared to those without LG6PD. Participants with HBV infection only and combined with HBV infection and LG6PD had 184% and 249% significantly higher risks of elevated alanine transaminase (ALT) (susceptible participants as reference). If the immunized participants were used as reference, significant higher odds of elevated ALT occurred (3.48 (95% CI: 3.18-3.80), 4.28 (95% CI: 2.92-6.28)). Thus, reproductive-age females with LG6PD had a higher prevalence of HBV infection, and LG6PD might exacerbate ALT elevation in HBV infected females. Our findings underscore the need to explore collaborative management approaches for these two diseases among reproductive-age females for maternal and child health.

2|chunk|Low glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity level (LG6PD) is one of typical features of G6PD deficiency, which is an X-linked incomplete dominant inheritance of red blood cell enzyme disease, as well as one of the most common causes of hemolytic anemia 1,2 . Reports indicate that more than 400 million people are affected by G6PD deficiency worldwide 1 . According to the population monitoring results of 2016 annual Chinese maternal and child health monitoring report, G6PD deficiency ranked second highest among all birth defects 3 . Most provinces in China had included the G6PD enzyme activity test program in neonatal screening. Previous studies showed that LG6PD was associated with reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), which is an important antioxidant in humans 4 . Low levels of NADPH bring about oxidative stress disorder which could result in dysfunctional granulocytes 5 and thus enhance the susceptibility to viral infections 2,6,7 .
