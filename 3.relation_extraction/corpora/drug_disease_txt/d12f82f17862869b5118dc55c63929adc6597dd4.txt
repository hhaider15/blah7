1|chunk|Highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 (HPAI H5N1) viruses can infect mammals, including humans, causing severe systemic disease with the inhibition of the immune system and a high mortality rate. In conditions of lymphoid tissue depletion, the liver plays an important role in host defence against viruses. The changes in mice liver infected with HPAI H5N1 virus A/goose/Krasnoozerskoye/627/05 have been studied. It has been shown that the virus persistence in the liver leads to the expression of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-, IL-6) and intracellular proteases (lysozyme, cathepsin D, and myeloperoxidase) by Kupffer cells. Defective antiviral response exacerbates destructive processes in the liver accelerating the development of liver failure.
