1|chunk|Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) has catastrophic impacts on the global pig industry. Although the fecal-oral route is generally accepted, an increased number of reports indicate that airborne transmission may contribute to PEDV outbreak. Here, we show that PEDV could cause typical diarrhea in piglets through a nasal spray. Firstly, PEDV can develop a transient nasal epithelium infection. Subsequently, PEDV-carrying dendritic cells (DCs) allow the virus to be transferred to CD3 + T cells via the virological synapse. Finally, virus-loaded CD3 + T cells reach the intestine through the blood circulation, leading to intestinal infection via cellto-cell contact. Our study provides evidence for airborne transmission of a gastrointestinal infected coronavirus and illustrates the mechanism of its transport from the entry site to the pathogenic site.
