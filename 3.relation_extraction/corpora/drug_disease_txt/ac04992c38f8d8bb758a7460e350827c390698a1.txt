1|chunk|Background Immunocompromised patients are at high risk for morbidity and mortality due to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. Increasingly, pediatric patients with malignancy or undergoing transplantation are managed primarily as outpatients. Data regarding the clinical presentation and outcomes of RSV in the outpatient pediatric immunocompromised population are limited. Methods We performed a retrospective cohort study of children with hematologic malignancy or hematopoietic or solid organ transplant with laboratory-confirmed RSV infection diagnosed as outpatients at an academic medical center between 2008 and 2013.

2|chunk|Results Of 54 patients with RSV detected while outpatients, 15 (28%) were hospitalized, 7 (13%) received ribavirin, and one (2%) received intravenous immunoglobulin. One (2%) patient was critically ill, but there were no deaths due to RSV infection. Fever (P < 001) was associated with increased risk of hospitalization.

3|chunk|Conclusions Most immunocompromised children with RSV detected while outpatients did not require hospitalization or receive antiviral treatment. Potential studies of RSV therapies should consider inclusion of patients in an ambulatory setting.
