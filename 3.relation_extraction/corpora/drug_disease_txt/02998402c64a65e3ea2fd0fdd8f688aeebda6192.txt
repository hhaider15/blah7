1|chunk|Sapelovirus A (SV-A) is currently spreading as an enteric pathogen of pigs worldwide. We isolated SV-A strain XTND/2018 from the small intestine of a dead pig with severe diarrhea in the north of Vietnam and determined the genomic sequence. This is the first report of the genomic sequence of SV-A circulating in Vietnam.
