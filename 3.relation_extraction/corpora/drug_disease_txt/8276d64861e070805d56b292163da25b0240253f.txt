1|chunk|In pneumonia, specimens are rarely obtained directly from the infection site, the lung, so the pathogen causing infection is determined indirectly from multiple tests on peripheral clinical specimens, which may have imperfect and uncertain sensitivity and specificity, so inference about the cause is complex. Analytic approaches have included expert review of case-only results, case-control logistic regression, latent class analysis, and attributable fraction, but each has serious limitations and none naturally integrate multiple test results. The Pneumonia Etiology Research for Child Health (PERCH) study required an analytic solution appropriate for a case-control design that could incorporate evidence from multiple specimens from cases and controls and that accounted for measurement error. We describe a Bayesian integrated approach we developed that combined and extended elements of attributable fraction and latent class analyses to meet some of these challenges and illustrate the advantage it confers regarding the challenges identified for other methods.

2|chunk|Studies aimed at determining the cause of pneumonia have inherent analytic challenges because they need to incorporate multiple types of laboratory measurements that have imperfect sensitivity and specificity for identifying the causative agent. This is because such studies may evaluate multiple specimens with multiple assays to improve sensitivity for each pathogen being tested, may include control children who do not have pneumonia to provide information on the test specificities, and may test for many pathogens to reveal potential causes for a greater number of cases. However, there are no existing analytic methods that can integrate such diverse data and account for their imperfect sensitivity and specificity to estimate the proportion of cases caused by each pathogen (ie, the etiologic distribution or etiology pie). Previous analytic approaches, which include expert review and latent class analysis for case-only data and logistic regression and attributable fraction for case-control studies, have 1 serious limitations (Figure 1 ), described in detail by Hammitt et al [1] . In addition, all of these methods intrinsically assume 100% sensitivity of the tests; although the expert review and attributable fraction approaches could account for sensitivity post hoc, there is no principled way to incorporate uncertainty around the sensitivity estimates.
