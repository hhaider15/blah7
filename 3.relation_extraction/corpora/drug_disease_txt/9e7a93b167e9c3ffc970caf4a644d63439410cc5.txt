1|chunk|Background: Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) and MBL-associated serine proteases 2 (MASP-2) are important proteins in the lectin pathway of the immune system. Polymorphism of MBL and MASP-2 genes may affect the serum concentration of MBL and MASP-2. This study explores the association between MBL and MASP-2 gene polymorphism and their interactions and the susceptibility to tuberculosis (TB). Method: A total of 503 patients with TB and 419 healthy controls were recruited to participate in this case-control study. PCR-SSP technology was applied to genotype rs7096206 of MBL genes and rs2273346 and rs6695096 of MASP-2 genes. Demographic data and some exposure information were also obtained from study participants. Unconditional logistic regression analysis was used to identify association between the various factors and TB whilst Marginal Structural Linear Odds Models were used to estimate the interactions. Results: Both genotype GC at rs7096206 of MBL genes and genotype TC at rs2273346 and rs6695096 of MASP-2 genes were more prevalent in the TB patient group than the healthy control group (P < 0.05, OR 1.393, 1.302 and 1.426 respectively). The relative excess risk of interaction (RERI) between rs7096206 of MBL genes and rs2273346 and rs6695096 of MASP-2 genes was 0.897 (95% CI: 0.282, 1.513) and 1.142 (95% CI: 0.755, 1.530) respectively (P < 0.05).

2|chunk|Conclusion: Polymorphisms of MBL (rs7096206) and MASP-2 (rs2273346 and rs6695096) were associated with the susceptibility of TB, and there were gene-gene interactions among them.
