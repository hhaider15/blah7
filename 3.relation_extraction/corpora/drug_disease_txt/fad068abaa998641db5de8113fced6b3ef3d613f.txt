1|chunk|Porphyromonas gulae is a major periodontal pathogen in dogs, which can be transmitted to their owners. A major virulence factor of P. gulae consists of a 41-kDa filamentous appendage (FimA) on the cell surface, which is classified into three genotypes: A, B, and C. Thus far, inhibition of periodontal disease in dogs remains difficult. The present study assessed the inhibitory effects of a combination of clindamycin and interferon alpha (IFN-) formulation against P. gulae and periodontal disease. Growth of P. gulae was significantly inhibited by clindamycin; this inhibition had a greater effect on type C P. gulae than on type A and B isolates. In contrast, the IFN- formulation inhibited the expression of IL-1 and COX-2 elicited by type A and B isolates, but not that elicited by type C isolates. Furthermore, periodontal recovery was promoted by the administration of both clindamycin and ifn- formulation to dogs undergoing periodontal treatment; moreover, this combined treatment reduced the number of fimA genotypes in oral specimens from treated dogs. these results suggest that a combination of clindamycin and ifn- formulation inhibit P. gulae virulence and thus may be effective for the prevention of periodontal disease induced by P. gulae.
