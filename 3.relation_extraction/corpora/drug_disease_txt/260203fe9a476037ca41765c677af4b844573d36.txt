1|chunk|The phytochemical investigation on the roots of Acanthopanax henryi (Araliaceae) resulted in the discovery of twenty compounds whose chemical structures were elucidated by the analysis of 1D-, 2D-NMR, mass spectrometry data, other physicochemical properties, and a comparison of the spectral data with the literature. They were identified as (-)-sesamin ( ), helioxanthin ( ), savinin ( ), taiwanin C ( ), 6-methoxy-7-hydroxycoumarin ( ), behenic acid ( ), 3-O-caffeoyl-quinic acid ( ), 5-O-caffeoyl-quinic acid ( ), 1,3-di-O-caffeoyl-quinic acid ( ), 1,4-di-O-caffeoyl-quinic acid ( ), 1,5-di-O-caffeoyl-quinic acid ( ), (+)-threo-(7R,8R)guaiacylglycerol--coniferyl aldehyde ether ( ), (+)-erythro-(7S,8R)-guaiacylglycerol--coniferyl aldehyde ether ( ), ferulic acid ( ), caffeic acid ( ), stigmasterol ( ), -sitosterol ( ), adenosine ( ), syringin ( ), and trans-coniferin ( ). Among these isolates, compound showed inhibitory activity against lipopolysaccharide-(LPS-) induced nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE 2 ) production with IC 50 values of 2.22  0.11 and 2.28  0.23 M, respectively. The effects of compound were associated with the suppression of LPS-induced expression of the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) protein. Furthermore, compound negatively regulated the production of interleukin-(IL-) 1 and tumor-necrosis factor-(TNF-) at the transcriptional level in LPS-stimulated BV2 microglial cells. These antineuroinflammatory effects of compound were mediated by p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK).
