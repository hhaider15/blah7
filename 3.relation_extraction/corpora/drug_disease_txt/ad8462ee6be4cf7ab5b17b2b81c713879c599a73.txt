1|chunk|Human pathogenic positive single strand RNA ((+)ssRNA) viruses, including Chikungunya virus, pose severe health problems as for many neither efficient vaccines nor therapeutic strategies exist. To interfere with propagation, viral enzymatic activities are considered potential targets. Here we addressed the function of the viral macrodomains, conserved folds of non-structural proteins of many (+)ssRNA viruses. Macrodomains are closely associated with ADP-ribose function and metabolism. ADP-ribosylation is a post-translational modification controlling various cellular processes, including DNA repair, transcription and stress response. We found that the viral macrodomains possess broad hydrolase activity towards mono-ADP-ribosylated substrates of the mono-ADP-ribosyltransferases ARTD7, ARTD8 and ARTD10 (aka PARP15, PARP14 and PARP10, respectively), reverting this posttranslational modification both in vitro and in cells. In contrast, the viral macrodomains possess only weak activity towards poly-ADP-ribose chains synthesized by ARTD1 (aka PARP1). Unlike poly-ADPribosylglycohydrolase, which hydrolyzes poly-ADP-ribose chains to individual ADP-ribose units but cannot cleave the amino acid side chain -ADP-ribose bond, the different viral macrodomains release poly-ADP-ribose chains with distinct efficiency. Mutational and structural analyses identified key amino acids for hydrolase activity of the Chikungunya viral macrodomain. Moreover, ARTD8 and ARTD10 are induced by innate immune mechanisms, suggesting that the control of mono-ADP-ribosylation is part of a host-pathogen conflict.

2|chunk|ADP-ribosylation describes a posttranslational modification (PTM) in which an ADP-ribose (ADPr) moiety is transferred from NAD + onto substrate proteins with release of nicotinamide. Intracellular ADP-ribosylation is mainly catalyzed by enzymes of the ADP-ribosyltransferase diphtheria toxin-like (ARTD) family (also known as PARP family) 1 . Based on their biochemical features ARTDs can be subdivided into three groups: members of the first group (including ARTD1/2/5/6) are able to iteratively transfer multiple ADPr units onto their substrates resulting in the formation of long branched ADPr polymers (PAR). Group II enzymes (ARTD7/8/10-12/14-17) are restricted to mono-ADP-ribosylation (MARylation), in part due to the lack of a catalytically active glutamate. The latter have been suggested to use substrate-assisted catalysis to modify their targets 2,3 . Whether ARTD3 and 4 belong to group I or II, despite both having a catalytic glutamate, is somewhat controversial and requires further analyses 3 . Acceptor amino acids for ADP-ribosylation are still a matter of debate with some discrepancy between biochemical and mass spectrometry studies. Nevertheless, acidic amino acids are considered important acceptor sites for both group I and II enzymes 4 . Our own findings with ARTD10 strongly suggest that glutamates are the main sites of modification 2 . Proteins of the third group (ARTD9/13) lost the ability to bind NAD + due to amino acid substitutions in the NAD + binding pocket and therefore are catalytically inactive 1,5 . Recent evidence defines reader domains that are capable of interacting specifically with MARylated or poly-ADP-ribosylated (PARylated) substrates and thus participate in disseminating the information associated with this PTM 6,7 . Moreover, erasers have been identified that hydrolyze bonds between single ADPr units and between ADPr and the modified amino acid, defining ADP-ribosylation as a fully reversible PTM 7,8 .

3|chunk|A key protein fold involved in both reading and erasing ADP-ribosylation is the macrodomain, an evolutionary conserved structural domain 3,7-9 . Several macrodomains, including the one of the core histone macroH2A1.1, interact with ADPr polymers 7,9 . Others bind selectively to MARylated substrates, as shown for macrodomain 2 (macro2) or macrodomain 3 (macro3) of murine Artd8 10 . The macrodomains of ARTD7 are poorly characterized, while those of ARTD9 have been suggested to affect transcription and the DNA damage response 7,8 . Importantly, some macrodomains possess enzymatic activity. For example, the macrodomain of poly-ADP-ribosylglycohydrolase (PARG) degrades PAR chains, whereas the macrodomains of TARG1, MacroD1 and MacroD2 remove the terminal, protein bound ADPr unit 11-14 . Thus the latter enzymes hydrolyze the ester bond between the ADPr and a most likely acidic acceptor amino acid 11,12 . Together these findings document the important role of macrodomain folds in regulating ADP-ribosylation function and metabolism.

4|chunk|ADP-ribosylation is implicated in a variety of biological processes including DNA repair, chromatin remodeling, mitosis, transcription, and signaling 4,6,15 . A growing body of information suggests functions for MARylation at the interface between host and pathogens 3 . On the one hand MARylation of host proteins is catalyzed by a range of bacterial toxins, thereby promoting pathogenesis 16 . Thus MARylation is a conserved mechanism for host protein modulation to promote virulence. On the other hand accumulating evidence links intracellular MARylation to the innate immune response 17 . Infection of human monocytes by Borrelia burghdorferi results in elevated expression of ARTD8, 10 and 12 18 . In line with these findings, the expression of these three genes is also induced by interferon (IFN) responsive factor 1 as part of an antiviral program 19 . Moreover, monitoring the IFN response by a reporter gene construct defined ARTD10 as a type I IFN-stimulated gene 20 . ARTD7, 10 and 12 are induced upon IFN stimulation and inhibit alphavirus replication 21 . Furthermore, these proteins participate in repression of protein translation when combined with viral infection 21, 22 . In addition to these molecular and cell biological studies, evolutionary analyses indicate a broad role of ADP-ribosylation in virus-host interactions 23 . Several ARTD family members are under strong recurrent positive selection, including ARTD7, 8 and 9, the three ARTD family members possessing macrodomains as well as the catalytically inactive ARTD13 23 . The latter has been well established in antiviral immune defense. ARTD13 interferes with viral RNA translation and replication by interaction with viral RNA through its four CCCH-type zinc fingers thereby promoting its degradation 3 . Taken together these findings strongly imply important functions for ARTD family members in innate immunity and thus suggest that ADP-ribosylation and its functional consequences contribute to the resolution of host-pathogen conflicts.

5|chunk|As mentioned above, macrodomains can function as readers as well as erasers of MARylation 7,8 . The fact that macrodomains are also conserved domains of non-structural proteins of some positive single strand RNA ((+ ) ssRNA) viruses provides further evidence for a function of ADP-ribosylation in innate immunity 24,25 . These ((+ ) ssRNA) viruses include members of the alphavirus genus such as Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), O'nyong'nyong virus (ONNV), Sindbis virus (SINV), and Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis virus (VEEV); members of the orthohepevirus genus among them Hepatitis E virus (HEV), as well as members of the alphacoronavirus genus, to which Feline Infectious Peritonitis virus (FIPV), a mutant of Feline coronavirus, belongs. Some of these viruses are human pathogens. For example CHIKV, transmitted by mosquitoes, has resulted in large epidemics in recent years. One of its effects is severe joint pain that can last for months or even years, thus having considerable long-term effects on human health 26, 27 . CHIKV, among other (+ )ssRNA viruses, is one of the top rated pathogens that is in need for vaccine development 28 .

6|chunk|The viral macrodomains (vMDs) of the above mentioned viruses are only poorly characterized with regard to biochemical properties and biological functions. Some of the vMDs were shown to bind free ADPr as well as PAR 25 , while ADP-ribose-1 -monophosphatase (ADRP) activity was assigned to others 24, 29, 30 . Moreover, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus harbors two additional macrodomain folds in the SARS-unique domain, which lack ADPr binding, but instead interact with G-quadruplexes 31-34 . Very recently ADP-ribosylhydrolase activity has been reported for the viral macrodomains of HEV, SARS (the macrodomain fold of the X domain), and VEEV 35 . Several findings provide evidence for a biological relevance of vMDs. Mutation of the ADPr binding region of the SINV macrodomain of the non-structural protein 3 (nsP3) impairs viral replication in neurons 36 . Mutations in the vMD with ADRP activity of SARS coronavirus and human coronavirus 229E resulted in increased sensitivity to the antiviral effect of IFN compared with their wildtype counterparts 37 . Moreover, the mouse hepatitis virus macrodomain promotes virulence in mice 38 . vMDs thus seem to be critical for viral pathogenesis and evasion of the host immune response.
