0	0	8 Silicone	Chemical	CHEBI_48140

1|chunk|Liquid silicone (polydimethylsiloxane) is an inert material that is commonly used for cosmetic purpose. Silicone embolization syndrome (SES) can rapidly progress to pneumonitis as a consequence of the injection of nonmedical-grade liquid silicone. We describe a case of severe silicone pneumonitis complicated with acute respiratory distress syndrome and bilateral pneumothorax secondary to silicone gluteal augmentation. In this case report, we aim to discuss our experience and approach in managing an uncommon case of SES.
