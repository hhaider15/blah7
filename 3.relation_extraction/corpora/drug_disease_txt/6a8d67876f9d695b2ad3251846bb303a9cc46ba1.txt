1|chunk|The International Health Regulations state that early detection and immediate reporting of unusual health events is important for early warning and response systems.

2|chunk|Objective: To describe a pilot surveillance program established in health facilities in Yaound, Cameroon in 2017 which aimed to enable detection and reporting of public health events.

3|chunk|Health Laboratory, implemented event-based surveillance (EBS) in nine Yaound health facilities. Four signals were defined that could indicate possible public health events, and a reporting, triage, and verification system was established among partner organizations. A pre-defined laboratory algorithm was defined, and a series of workshops trained health facilities, laboratory, and public health staff for surveillance implementation.

4|chunk|: From May 2017 to January 2018, 30 signals were detected, corresponding to 15 unusual respiratory events. All health facilities reported a signal at least once, and more than three-quarters of health facilities reported 2 times. Among specimens tested, the pathogens detected included Klebsiella pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenza, Staphylococcus aureus, Pneumocystis jiroveci, influenza A (H1N1) virus, rhinovirus, and adenovirus.

5|chunk|The events detected in this pilot were caused by routine respiratory bacteria and viruses, and no novel influenza viruses or other emerging respiratory threats were identified. The surveillance system, however, strengthened relationships and communication linkages between health facilities and public health authorities.
