1|chunk|Infectious bronchitis (IB) is one of the most important viral diseases of poultry. The aim of this study was to investigate the distribution of avian infectious bronchitis virus isolate IRFIBV32 (793/B serotype) in experimentally infected chicken. Ninetyone-day-old commercial broilers were divided randomly into two groups (seventy in the experimental and twenty in the control group). Chicks in the experimental group were inoculated intranasally with 10 5 ELD50/0.1 mL of the virus at three weeks of age. The samples from various tissues were collected at1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 15, and 20 days postinoculation. Chickens exhibited mild respiratory signs and depression. Viral RNA was detected in the kidney, lung and tracheas on days 1 to 13 PI, in the oviduct between, days 3 and 13, in testes between days 1 and 11 PI, and in the caecal tonsil consistently up to day 20 PI. The most remarkable clinical signs and virus detection appeared on day 1 PI. Data indicated that the number of infected chickens and viral RNA detection from tissues was reduced with increasing antibody titer on day 20 PI. The results demonstrated that the IRFIBV32 virus has wide tissue distribution for respiratory, urogenital, and digestive systems.
