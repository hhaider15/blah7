1|chunk|Viral late domains are used by many viruses to recruit the cellular endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) to mediate membrane scission during viral budding. Unlike the P(S/T)AP and YPX (1-3) L late domains, which interact directly with the ESCRT proteins Tsg101 and ALIX, the molecular linkage connecting the PPXY late domain to ESCRT proteins is unclear. The mammarenavirus lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) matrix protein, Z, contains only one late domain, PPXY. We previously found that this domain in LCMV Z, as well as the ESCRT pathway, are required for the release of defective interfering (DI) particles but not infectious virus. To better understand the molecular mechanism of ESCRT recruitment by the PPXY late domain, affinity purification-mass spectrometry was used to identify host proteins that interact with the Z proteins of the Old World mammarenaviruses LCMV and Lassa virus. Several Nedd4 family E3 ubiquitin ligases interact with these matrix proteins and in the case of LCMV Z, the interaction was PPXY-dependent. We demonstrated that these ligases directly ubiquitinate LCMV Z and mapped the specific lysine residues modified. A recombinant LCMV containing a Z that cannot be ubiquitinated maintained its ability to produce both infectious virus and DI particles, suggesting that direct ubiquitination of LCMV Z alone is insufficient for recruiting ESCRT proteins to mediate virus release. However, Nedd4 ligases appear to be important for DI PLOS Pathogens | https://doi.org/10.
