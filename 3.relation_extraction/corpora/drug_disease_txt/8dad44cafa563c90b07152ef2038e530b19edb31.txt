1|chunk|Lassa virus (LASV) and Mopeia virus (MOPV) are two closely related, rodent-born mammarenaviruses. LASV is the causative agent of Lassa fever, a deadly hemorrhagic fever endemic in West Africa, whereas MOPV is non-pathogenic in humans. The Z matrix protein of arenaviruses is essential to virus assembly and budding by recruiting host factors, a mechanism that remains partially defined. To better characterize the interactions involved, a yeast two-hybrid screen was conducted using the Z proteins from LASV and MOPV as a bait. The cellular proteins ITCH and WWP1, two members of the Nedd4 family of HECT E3 ubiquitin ligases, were found to bind the Z proteins of LASV, MOPV and other arenaviruses. The PPxY late-domain motif of the Z proteins is required for the interaction with ITCH, although the E3 ubiquitin-ligase activity of ITCH is not involved in Z ubiquitination. The silencing of ITCH was shown to affect the replication of the old-world mammarenaviruses LASV, MOPV, Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) and to a lesser extent Lujo virus (LUJV). More precisely, ITCH was involved in the egress of virus-like particles and the release of infectious progeny viruses. Thus, ITCH constitutes a novel interactor of LASV and MOPV Z proteins that is involved in virus assembly and release.

2|chunk|Viruses 2020, 12, 49 2 of 20 arenavirus complex known to cause VHF includes Lassa virus (LASV) and the recently discovered Lujo virus (LUJV) [3, 4] . The prototypic arenavirus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), which is distributed worldwide, is also of clinical significance [5] . The most prevalent pathogen among the arenaviruses is LASV, the causative agent of Lassa fever (LF), which is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality, with tens of thousands of cases annually and thousands of fatalities in West Africa [6] . The disease is characterized by acute forms associated with fever, myalgia, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, cough, sore throat, and facial edema and evolves toward a shock syndrome in the terminal stage for severe cases. The tendency of LASV to cause outbreaks has steadily risen in Nigeria over the last three years, with laboratory-confirmed cases increasing from 106 in 2016 to 143 in 2017 and reaching 562 by November 2018 [7] . Additionally, there is currently no licensed vaccine or efficient antiviral drug available in the field against this disease, for which the area of endemicity is expanding [8] . The particularity of arenaviruses is the presence of non-pathogenic agents that are not associated with human disease, despite their isolation from the same host species. This is true for Mopeia virus (MOPV), which is closely related to LASV but has never been associated to human infection [9]. MOPV has even been shown to protect non-human primates against a challenge with LASV, showing that both viruses are antigenically related. Comparing LASV and MOPV should therefore allow the identification of immune and viral features involved in LF pathogenesis and, to a lesser extent, other arenavirus-associated VHFs.

3|chunk|The bi-segmented RNA genome of the Arenaviridae family encodes four proteins: the nucleoprotein (NP), the surface glycoprotein precursor (GPC), the L polymerase, and the RING finger protein Z [10, 11] . Although it is the smallest arenavirus protein, the Z matrix protein plays multiple functions in the viral life cycle, including structural and non-structural roles. The Z protein is known to regulate key host-cell functions through direct interactions to favor viral replication. These cellular factors include the promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML), the nuclear fraction of the ribosomal protein P0, the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), and the proline-rich homeodomain protein (PRH) [12] [13] [14] . The Z protein may also be involved in viral escape from the innate immune response [15, 16] . Previous studies have also revealed an inhibitory effect of the Z protein on both transcription and replication using a LCMV reverse genetic system [17] . In addition to its non-structural roles, the Z protein plays a critical role in viral assembly by mediating the incorporation of GP, NP, and the L polymerase into nascent virions [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . Importantly, the Z proteins of LASV and LCMV contain a PPxY late domain that is known, as for enveloped viruses, to mediate viral budding through the recruitment of the ESCRT-associated protein TSG101 and Alix [25, 26] . The LASV Z PPxY motif has also been shown to interact with Nedd4, from the Nedd4 family of HECT E3 ligases and this interaction may be required for efficient budding of the virus, as has been shown during various viral infections [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] . Overall, the arenavirus Z protein is central in the viral life cycle and interacts with a variety of cellular factors that may have been only partially discovered and are not yet fully understood.

4|chunk|We addressed this potential knowledge gap by screening the Z proteins from non-pathogenic MOPV and pathogenic LASV Z protein interactions using high-throughput yeast two-hybrid screening (Y2H). Twenty-four host-cell partners were identified and validated in a secondary Y2H assay, including two Nedd4-family proteins, ITCH and WWP1. We therefore focused on the functional role of these proteins during non-pathogenic MOPV and pathogenic LCMV, LASV, and LUJV infections. We observed that ITCH was required for the replication of tested viruses, and confirmed with other techniques the interaction of ITCH with the Z proteins of different arenaviruses. We showed that the interaction of MOPV and LASV Z with ITCH occurred through their PPXY late domain and did not require the E3 ubiquitin-ligase activity of ITCH. Finally, we demonstrated that ITCH was important for LASV and MOPV infectious-particle production and was required for the release of viral progeny.
