0	14	29 Cystic Fibrosis	Disease	DOID_1485

1|chunk|CF is caused by mutations of the gene encoding the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) which is an anion selective transmembrane ion channel that mainly regulates chloride transport, expressed in the epithelia of various organs. Recently, we have demonstrated CFTR expression in the brain, the spinal cord and the sympathetic ganglia. This study aims to investigate the expression and distribution of CFTR in the ganglia of the human gastrointestinal tract. Fresh tissue and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded normal gastrointestinal tract samples were collected from eleven surgical patients and five autopsy cases. Immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, laserassisted microdissection and nested reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction were performed. Expression of CFTR protein and mRNA was detected in neurons of the ganglia of all segments of the human gastrointestinal tract examined, including the stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum, appendix, colon and rectum. The extensive expression of CFTR in the enteric ganglia suggests that CFTR may play a role in the physiology of the innervation of the gastro-intestinal tract. The presence of dysfunctional CFTRs in enteric ganglia could, to a certain extent, explain the gastrointestinal symptoms frequently experienced by CF patients.

2|chunk|Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a multiorgan autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) gene 1-3 . The CFTR gene encodes a cAMP-regulated chloride channel protein present in the apical membrane of epithelial cells. Over 1900 mutations have been identified in the CFTR gene, but 70% of CF patients have has a homozygote deletion of three base pairs in the CFTR nucleotide sequence resulting in the absence of the phenylalanine residue at position 508 of the CFTR protein 4,5 .

3|chunk|The primary sites where CF manifests itself include the respiratory tract, digestive tract, urogenital tract, and sweat glands 6,7 . In these organs the malfunction of the mutated ion channel leads to fluid and electrolyte transportation disorders along with obstructed ducts, atrophic epithelia, gland hypertrophy and ultimately results in inflammation and fibrosis [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . CFTR was originally thought to be exclusively expressed by epithelial cells. However, recent studies have shown CFTR expression in neurons of the human central nervous system, including the brain and spinal cord 14-18 . In addition, widespread presence of CFTR has been demonstrated in the peripheral nervous system, including human spinal, sympathetic and paracervical ganglia [14] [15] [16] 19, 20 . These findings suggest that CFTR plays a significant role in the physiology of the central and peripheral nervous system. The enteric nervous system (ENS) is regarded as the intrinsic nervous system of the tractus gastrointestinalis 21,22 . It is composed of two plexuses embedded in the wall of the gastrointestinal tract, i.e. the myenteric plexus and the submucosal plexus 21,22 . The ENS is connected to the central nervous system through sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves. It regulates motility, glandular secretions, fluid transport, and local blood flow, among others 21 . In addition to the tractus gastrointestinalis, the ENS also exists in the walls of the pancreas and biliary tract, but these organ systems were not investigated in the present study.
