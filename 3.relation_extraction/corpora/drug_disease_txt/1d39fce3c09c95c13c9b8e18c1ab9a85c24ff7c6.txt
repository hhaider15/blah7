In experiment 1, Groups 1 and 2 were inoculated with H9N2 AIV through nasal route in 1 day old, Groups 1 and 3 were vaccinated with live infectious bronchitis coronavirus (IBV) vaccine in 5 days old, and Group 4 was left as a negative control. In experiment 2, Groups 5 and 6 were inoculated with AIV subtype H9N2 through nasal route in 1 day old, Group 5 was vaccinated with live IBV vaccine and live Newcastle disease virus (NDV) vaccine in 5 and 18 days old, respectively, Groups 6 and 7 were vaccinated with live NDV vaccine in 18 days old, and Group 8 was left as a negative control. Chicks were kept in isolators for 18 days in the first experiment and 35 days in the second experiment. Tracheal and cloacal swabs were collected from 3, 5, 7, 10, 12, and 15 day's old chicks from all groups in experiment 1 and 21, 23, 25, and 28 days old from all groups in experiment 2. Quantitative real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) was applied on the collected tracheal swabs for detecting RNA copies of H9N2 AIV. Cloacal swabs and the positive rRT-PCR tracheal swabs were inoculated in 10-day-old SPF embryonated chicken eggs (ECE) to confirm rRT-PCR results. Internal organs (kidney, trachea, and spleen) from all chicken groups were collected weekly for histopathological examination to determine severity of the lesions. Serum samples were collected on a weekly basis for the detection of humoral immune response against H9N2, NDV, and IBV from all chicken groups.

4|chunk|Results: rRT-PCR results with virus titration in ECEs revealed a significant increase in H9N2 AIV titer with extension in the period of viral shedding in Groups 1 and 5. Severe lesion score was observed for Groups 1 and 5. The humoral immune response against H9N2 AIV, NDV, and IBV revealed a significant increase in H9N2 AIV titer in Groups 1 and 5, NDV titer showed a significant increase in Group 7, and IBV titer increased in Groups 1, 3, and 5.

5|chunk|Results demonstrated the increase in pathogenicity of H9N2 AIV, especially when H9N2-infected chicks vaccinated with live IBV vaccine.
