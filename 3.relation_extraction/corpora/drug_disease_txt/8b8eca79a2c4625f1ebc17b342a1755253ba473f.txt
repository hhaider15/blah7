2|chunk|Upon initiation at a start codon, the ribosome must maintain the correct reading frame for hundreds of codons in order to produce functional proteins. While some sequence elements are able to trigger programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF), very little is known about how the ribosome normally prevents spontaneous frameshift errors that can have dire consequences if uncorrected. Using high resolution ribosome profiling data sets, we discovered that the translating ribosome uses the 3 end of 18S rRNA to scan the AUG-like codons after the decoding process. The postdecoding mRNA:rRNA interaction not only contributes to predominant translational pausing, but also provides a retrospective mechanism to safeguard the ribosome in the correct reading frame. Partially eliminating the AUG-like "sticky" codons in the reporter message leads to increased +1 frameshift errors. Remarkably, mutating the highly conserved CAU triplet of 18S rRNA globally changes the codon "stickiness". Further supporting the role of "sticky" sequences in reading frame maintenance, the codon composition of open reading frames is highly optimized across eukaryotic genomes. These results suggest an important layer of information embedded within the protein-coding sequences that instructs the ribosome to ensure reading frame fidelity during translation.
