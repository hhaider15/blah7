The present time-series analyses of short and long oligonucleotide compositions in these genomes showed directional changes in their composition after invasion from a nonhuman host, which are thought to recur after future invasions. In the recent West Africa Ebola outbreak, directional time-series changes in a wide range of oligonucleotides were observed in common for three geographic areas, and the directional changes were observed also for the recent MERS coronavirus epidemics starting in the Middle East. In addition, common directional changes in human influenza A viruses were observed for three subtypes, whose epidemics started independently. Long oligonucleotides that showed an evident directional change observed in common for the three subtypes corresponded to some of influenza A siRNAs, whose activities have been experimentally proven. Predicting directional and reoccurring changes in oligonucleotide composition should become important for designing diagnostic RT-PCR primers and therapeutic oligonucleotides with long effectiveness.
