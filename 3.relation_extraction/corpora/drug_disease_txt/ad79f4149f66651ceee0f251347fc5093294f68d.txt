1|chunk|Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) leader protein (L pro ) is a papain-like proteinase, which plays an important role in FMDV pathogenesis. L pro exists as two forms, Lab and Lb, due to translation being initiated from two different start codons separated by 84 nucleotides. L pro self-cleaves from the nascent viral polyprotein precursor as the first mature viral protein. In addition to its role as a viral proteinase, L pro also has the ability to antagonize host antiviral effects. To promote FMDV replication, L pro can suppress host antiviral responses by three different mechanisms: (1) cleavage of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4  (eIF4G) to shut off host protein synthesis; (2) inhibition of host innate immune responses through restriction of interferon-/ production; and (3) L pro can also act as a deubiquitinase and catalyze deubiquitination of innate immune signaling molecules. In the light of recent functional and biochemical findings regarding L pro , this review introduces the basic properties of L pro and the mechanisms by which it antagonizes host antiviral responses.  2015 Liu et al.
