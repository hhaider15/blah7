1|chunk|Objective: To describe the epidemiology of RSV infection and to analyze the factors associated with severe infections in children and adults in Mexico.

2|chunk|Patients 1 month old, who presented with an influenza-like illness (ILI) to six hospitals in Mexico, were eligible for participation in the study. Multiplex reversetranscriptase polymerase chain reaction identified viral pathogens in nasal swabs from 5629 episodes of ILI. Patients in whom RSV was detected were included in this report.

3|chunk|Results: Respiratory syncytial virus was detected in 399 children and 171 adults. RSV A was detected in 413 cases and RSV B in 163, including six patients who had coinfection with both subtypes; 414 (72.6%) patients required hospital admission, including 96 (16.8%) patients that required admission to the intensive care unit. Coinfection with one or more respiratory pathogens other than RSV was detected in 159 cases.

4|chunk|Young age (in children) and older age (in adults) as well as the presence of some underlying conditions were associated with more severe disease.

5|chunk|This study confirms that RSV is an important respiratory pathogen in children in Mexico. In addition, a substantial number of cases in adults were also detected highlighting the relevance of this virus in all ages. It is important to identify subjects at high risk of complications who may benefit from current or future preventive interventions.
