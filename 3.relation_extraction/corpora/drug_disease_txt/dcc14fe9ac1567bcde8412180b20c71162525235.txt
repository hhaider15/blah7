1|chunk|Influenza A viruses (IAVs) are important zoonotic pathogens that cause epidemic outbreaks in poultry, wild birds, swine, and other mammals. In humans, IAVs cause severe respiratory illness, and zoonotic transmission of IAVs from avian reservoirs poses a constant threat to the public health, as exemplified by the recent outbreak of an avian IAV of the H7N9 subtype [1]. Aquatic birds are considered to be the major reservoir of IAVs, and 16 hemagglutinin (HA) and nine neuraminidase (NA) viral subtypes have been isolated from avian species to date. It is now well documented that from time to time IAVs overcome the species barrier and establish new lineages in other animals, including domestic animals, sea mammals, and humans (Fig 1) . Our understanding of IAVs was recently challenged by the identification of two novel genome sequences of influenza A-like viruses from bat specimens by next-generation sequencing. These viruses were provisionally designated "H17N10" (from yellow-shouldered fruit bats [Sturnira lilium] in Guatemala) and "H18N11" (from flat-faced fruit bats [Artibeus planirostris] in Peru) [2,3], which might signal an expansion of IAV host range (Fig 1) .

2|chunk|Biochemical and structural studies indicate that both the influenza A-like H17 and H18 proteins do not bind canonical sialic acid-containing receptors [3] [4] [5] , which are bound by HAs of conventional IAVs for initiation of infection. Furthermore, the crystal structure of H17 and H18 revealed that these proteins possess a distorted putative sialic acid binding site and showed low thermostability when compared to all known well-characterized HAs [3, 5] . In fact, H17 and H18 HAs are unable to bind and hemagglutinate red blood cells and therefore are not "true" HAs. Thus, we suggest that HAs from both H17 and H18 influenza A-like viruses should be named as "HA-like" (HL) proteins (HL17 and HL18).

3|chunk|Consistent with the observation that bat influenza A-like HL17 and HL18 do not bind to canonical sialic acid receptors, bat NAs lack detectable neuraminidase activity [6] . Although the overall N10 structure is similar to other known influenza NA structures, the region corresponding to the highly conserved active site in the N1-N9 subtypes is substantially different [6, 7] . The structural features and the fact that the recombinant N10 protein exhibits no or extremely low NA activity suggests that it may have a different function than the NA proteins of other influenza viruses. We therefore suggest that N10 and N11 from bat influenza A-like viruses should be designated as "NA-like" (NL) proteins (NL10 and NL11). Furthermore, the PLOS Pathogens |
