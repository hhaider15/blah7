9|chunk|To obtain the chimpanzee KIR haplotype H13, the CHORI RPCI-43 BAC library was screened with a 32 P-labeled probe containing a mix of Pt-KIR2DL4, Pt-KIR3DL4 and Pt-KIR3DL1/2 cDNA. The KIR gene content of the clones was determined by typing [1] and the clone with the largest complete KIR haplotype selected for sequencing (RP43-84K19). To facilitate sequencing, the insert was first digested with NotI and the four NotI fragments subcloned before shotgun libraries were prepared (TOPO Shotgun Subcloning Kit, Invitrogen). The sequences of the four NotI fragments were joined by direct sequencing on the original insert. Sequencing was performed on an ABI377 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems) and sequences were assembled with the STADEN package [2] . Each base pair of the final assembly was covered in both directions, by at least three sequences from at least two different templates and had a quality >40 (error rate <1/10,000). The final sequence was deposited in Genbank (accession number HM068617).
