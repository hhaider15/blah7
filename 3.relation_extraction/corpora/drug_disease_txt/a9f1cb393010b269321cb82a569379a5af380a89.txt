1|chunk|e comparison of protein sequences according to similarity is a fundamental aspect of today's biomedical research. With the developments of sequencing technologies, a large number of protein sequences increase exponentially in the public databases. Famous sequences' comparison methods are alignment based. ey generally give excellent results when the sequences under study are closely related and they are time consuming. Herein, a new alignment-free method is introduced. Our technique depends on a new graphical representation and descriptor. e graphical representation of protein sequence is a simple way to visualize protein sequences. e descriptor compresses the primary sequence into a single vector composed of only two values. Our approach gives good results with both short and long sequences within a little computation time. It is applied on nine beta globin, nine ND5 (NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5), and 24 spike protein sequences. Correlation and significance analyses are also introduced to compare our similarity/dissimilarity results with others' approaches, results, and sequence homology.
