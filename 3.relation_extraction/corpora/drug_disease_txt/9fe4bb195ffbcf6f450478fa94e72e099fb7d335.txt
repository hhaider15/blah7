1|chunk|Background: A novel avian influenza A (H7N9) virus emerged in eastern China in February 2013. 413 confirmed human cases, including 157 deaths, have been recorded as of July 31, 2014. Methods: Clinical specimens, including throat swabs, sputum or tracheal aspirates, etc., were obtained from patients exhibiting influenza-like illness (ILIs), especially from those having pneumonia and a history of occupational exposure to poultry and wild birds. RNA was extracted from these samples and a multiplex one-step real-time RT-PCR assay was developed to specifically detect the influenza A virus (FluA). PCR primers targeted the conserved M and Rnase P (RP) genes, as well as the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes of the H7N9 virus.

2|chunk|Results: The multiplex assay specifically detected the avian H7N9 virus, and no cross-reaction with other common respiratory pathogens was observed. The detection limit of the assay was approximately 0.05 50% tissue culture infective doses (TCID 50 ), or 100 copies per reaction. Positive detection of the H7N9 virus in sputum/tracheal aspirates was higher than in throat swabs during the surveillance of patients with ILIs. Additionally, detection of the matrix (M) and Rnase P genes aided in the determination of the novel avian H7N9 virus and ensured the quality of the clinical samples.

3|chunk|Conclusions: These results demonstrate that the multiplex assay detected the novel avian H7N9 virus with high specificity and sensitivity, which is essential for the early diagnosis and treatment of infected patients.
