1|chunk|The basic reproductive number (R) and the distribution of the serial interval (SI) are often used to quantify transmission during an infectious disease outbreak. In this paper, we present estimates of R and SI from the 2003 SARS outbreak in Hong Kong and Singapore, and the 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) outbreak in South Africa using methods that expand upon an existing Bayesian framework. This expanded framework allows for the incorporation of additional information, such as contact tracing or household data, through prior distributions. The results for the R and the SI from the influenza outbreak in South Africa were similar regardless of the prior information (R 0 = 1.36-1.46,m = 2.0-2.7,m = mean of the SI). The estimates of R and  for the SARS outbreak ranged from 2.0-4.4 and 7.4-11.3, respectively, and were shown to vary depending on the use of contact tracing data. The impact of the contact tracing data was likely due to the small number of SARS cases relative to the size of the contact tracing sample.

2|chunk|To model an outbreak using a Bayesian method, prior distributions are necessary for each parameter of interest: in this instance R 0 and p = {p i ,. . ., p k }. We choose the prior distribution for R 0 to be log-normal, such that log(R 0 ) is distributed Gaussian with mean 0 and variance 1,000.
