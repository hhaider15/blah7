1|chunk|Infection with human BK polyomavirus, a small double-stranded DNA virus, potentially results in severe complications in immunocompromised patients. Here, we describe the in vivo variability and evolution of the BK polyomavirus by deep sequencing. Our data reveal the highest genomic evolutionary rate described in double-stranded DNA viruses, i.e., 10 3 -10 5 substitutions per nucleotide site per year. High mutation rates in viruses allow their escape from immune surveillance and adaptation to new hosts. By combining mutational landscapes across viral genomes with in silico prediction of viral peptides, we demonstrate the presence of significantly more coding substitutions within predicted cognate HLA-C-bound viral peptides than outside. This finding suggests a role for HLA-C in antiviral immunity, perhaps through the action of killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors. The present study provides a comprehensive view of viral evolution and immune escape in a DNA virus.

2|chunk|Little is known about the mechanisms of evolution and viral immune escape in doublestranded DNA (dsDNA) viruses. Here, we study the evolution of BK polyomavirus and observe the highest genomic evolutionary rate described so far for a dsDNA virus, in the range of RNA viruses, which usually evolve rapidly. Furthermore, the prediction of viral peptides to determine immune escape suggests a specific role of HLA-C in antiviral immunity. These findings are helpful for future advances in antiviral therapies and provide a step forward in our understanding of in vivo viral evolution in humans.
