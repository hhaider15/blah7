1|chunk|Background: It is a commonly accepted belief that cancer cells modify their transcriptional state during the progression of the disease. We propose that the progression of cancer cells towards malignant phenotypes can be efficiently tracked using high-throughput technologies that follow the gradual changes observed in the gene expression profiles by employing Shannon's mathematical theory of communication. Methods based on Information Theory can then quantify the divergence of cancer cells' transcriptional profiles from those of normally appearing cells of the originating tissues. The relevance of the proposed methods can be evaluated using microarray datasets available in the public domain but the method is in principle applicable to other high-throughput methods.

2|chunk|Methodology/Principal Findings: Using melanoma and prostate cancer datasets we illustrate how it is possible to employ Shannon Entropy and the Jensen-Shannon divergence to trace the transcriptional changes progression of the disease. We establish how the variations of these two measures correlate with established biomarkers of cancer progression. The Information Theory measures allow us to identify novel biomarkers for both progressive and relatively more sudden transcriptional changes leading to malignant phenotypes. At the same time, the methodology was able to validate a large number of genes and processes that seem to be implicated in the progression of melanoma and prostate cancer.

3|chunk|Conclusions/Significance: We thus present a quantitative guiding rule, a new unifying hallmark of cancer: the cancer cell's transcriptome changes lead to measurable observed transitions of Normalized Shannon Entropy values (as measured by high-througput technologies). At the same time, tumor cells increment their divergence from the normal tissue profile increasing their disorder via creation of states that we might not directly measure. This unifying hallmark allows, via the the Jensen-Shannon divergence, to identify the arrow of time of the processes from the gene expression profiles, and helps to map the phenotypical and molecular hallmarks of specific cancer subtypes. The deep mathematical basis of the approach allows us to suggest that this principle is, hopefully, of general applicability for other diseases.

6|chunk|In the original study, the authors used a cDNA microarray technology that allowed them to measure gene expression of several thousand genes on 112 samples, including 41 normal prostate specimens, 62 primary prostate tumours and 9 lymph node metastases. From that set, a subset of 5,153 probes were selected as differentiating prostate cancer samples from normal and metastases (this is the set from figure one in Lapointe et al.

7|chunk|. We have seen in Figure 1 , that the Normalized Shannon Entropy and the MPR-Statistical Complexity differentiate the metastatic samples from the normal samples, but that these two measures can not help to discriminate the primary tumors from the normals. We show here the results of two statistical complexity measures which are in some sense supervised (i.e. dependent on the dataset being interrogated). We call these two stastical mesured M-Normal and M-Metastases. They have the same functional form of the MPR-Statistical Complexity, but they use the average normal and average metastatic profile as probability distribution functions of reference. As a consequence, the M-normal and M-metastases are directly proportional to the Jensen-Shannon divergences with the normal (and respectively with the metastatic) gene expression profile. It is remarkable that, although we are using these end processes only (from Lapointe et al's, dataset of 5,153 probes6112 samples), most of the primary tumor samples appear as a transitional state between the normal and metastatic group. This is remarkable since the primary tumor samples were not used to define the M-normal and M-metastases measures and, in principle, the samples could have been located anywhere in the (M-normal, M-metastases)-plane. Computation of correlations of the probe expressions values can help us identify genes which are highly correlated with a divergence from the normal expression profile and, at the same time, converge towards the average metastatic profile.

We have computed the Pearson and Spearman correlation of each probe expression (across samples) with the Jensen-Shannon divergence of each of the samples with the average metastasis profile (these values are called JSM2-Pearson and JSM2-Spearman in the accompanying Excel file provided). One of the clinically most relevant markers for prostate cancer (KLK3/PSA) together with FOS, CCL2/MCP-1, SOX9 and a probe for LOC51334 (mesenchymal stem cell protein DSC54) appear with highly negative Spearman and Pearson correlations values, indicating that they are negatively correlated with the Jensen-Shannon divergence from the average metastatic profile.

9|chunk|, and CDKN2D (a CDK4 inhibitor) in opposition with KLK3/PSA, seems to be positively correlated. As will be seen later in the analysis of the melanoma dataset, these positive correlations with the Jensen-Shannon divergence from the average metastatic profile indicate a possible dysregulation of these critical processes for which these genes have key roles.
