1|chunk|Mink enteritis virus (MEV) is one of the most important pathogens in the mink industry. Recent studies have shed light into the role of microRNAs (miRNAs), small noncoding RNAs of length ranging from 18-23 nucleotides (nt), as critical modulators in the host-pathogen interaction networks. We previously showed that miRNA miR-181b can inhibit MEV replication by repression of viral non-structural protein 1 expression. Here, we report that two other miRNAs (miR-320a and miR-140) inhibit MEV entry into feline kidney (F81) cells by downregulating its receptor, transferrin receptor (TfR), by targeting the 3 untranslated region (UTR) of TfR mRNA, while being themselves upregulated.
