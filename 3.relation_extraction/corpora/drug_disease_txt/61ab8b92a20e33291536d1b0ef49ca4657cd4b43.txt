1|chunk|The historical role of mitochondria resides in converting the energy released during the oxidation of macromolecules (carbohydrates, lipids and proteins) into adenosine tri-phosphate, a major form of chemically stored energy which sustains cell growth and homeostasis. Beyond this role in bioenergetics regulation, mitochondria play a role in several other cellular processes including lipid metabolism, cellular calcium homeostasis, autophagy and immune responses. Furthermore, mitochondria are highly dynamic organelles: as all other cellular endomembranes, they are continuously moving along cytoskeleton, and, most importantly, they constantly interact one with each other by membrane tethering, fusion and fission. This review aims to highlight the tight correlation between the morphodynamics of mitochondria and their biological function(s), in physiological as well as stress conditions, in particular nutrient deprivation, pathogen attack and some human diseases. Finally, we emphasize some crosstalk between the fusion/fission machinery and the autophagy pathway to ending on some speculative hypothesis to inspire future research in the field. mediates the fusion of the inner mitochondrial membranes (MIM). These two phases are coordinated and occur almost simultaneously ( Figure 1 ).

2|chunk|Mitofusins were first described to be required for MT fusion in drosophila [4] and yeast [5] . In mammals, mouse knockout models illustrate their importance in fusion. Indeed, deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) in either Mfn1 or Mfn2 present highly fragmented mitochondria compared to the tubular and interconnected mitochondrial network observed in wild-type (WT) cells [3] . Beside its role in MT fusion, MFN 2 is also implicated in the formation of Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)-MT contact sites [6] and in MT-lipid droplets interaction [7] .

3|chunk|The mechanism by which mitofusins mediate MT fusion is not fully understood, although it was suggested that MFN 1 and MFN 2 form homo-or hetero-oligomeric complexes by interacting in trans between neighbouring mitochondria, thereby promoting their tethering and subsequent fusion of

4|chunk|OPA1, whose gene mutation is associated with a dominant optic atrophy disease [9] (Table 1) , is localized to the MIM and the MT intermembrane space. Opa1 / cells present fragmented mitochondrial morphology, although some MOM fusion events were described [10] . Moreover, Opa1 depletion triggers other cellular defects including reduction and disorganization of cristae membranes, reduced respiration capacity, altered mtDNA maintenance and increased sensitivity to apoptosis [11] . Different isoforms of OPA1 arise through differential RNA splicing and protein processing. Importantly, it has been shown that MT fusion depends on a proper ratio between two major forms of OPA1: The Long (L-OPA1) and Short (S-OPA1) isoforms. In fact, L-OPA1 is associated with efficient MT fusion, while S-OPA1 is thought to be a fission mediator [12] . OPA1 processing is catalysed by the ATP-dependent protease YME1L and the membrane potential-dependent protease OMA1 (metallopeptidase Overlapping with the m-AAA protease1). Thus, proteolysis via Yme1L is responsible for oxidative phosphorylation-dependent stimulation of inner-membrane fusion. In contrast, the dissipation of membrane potential triggers OMA1 activation and subsequent cleavage and inactivation of OPA1 [13] . Various cellular stresses can activate Oma1 to cleave Opa1 [14] . Cells in which Oma1 expression is down-regulated recovered fused mitochondria more quickly than control cells after CCCP-treatment (CarbonylCyanure m-ChloroPhnylhydrazone) and became less sensitive to staurosporine-induced apoptosis [15] , suggesting that, in these conditions, OMA1 regulates the functions of the dynamin by modulating the abundance of the L-isoform [15] . This mechanism likely contributes to the mitochondrial fragmentation observed in different forms of mitochondrial dysfunction [16] .

5|chunk|In addition to proteolytic regulation of OPA1, some post-translational modifications have also been described. In neonatal cardiac myocytes, high-glucose exposure triggers increased O-GlcNAcylation of OPA1, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction by increasing mitochondrial fragmentation [17] . Moreover, prolonged treatment of rat kidney proximal tubular cells by prostaglandin showed that OPA1 is subjected to ubiquitination and subsequent degradation [18] . In the context of heart pathological stress, OPA1 is hyperacetylated and inactivated [19] . It has been shown that the mitochondrial deacetylase SIRT3 was capable of deacetylating OPA1 and elevating its GTPase activity. SIRT3-dependent activation of OPA1 contributes to the preservation of mitochondrial networking and protection of cardiomyocytes from doxorubicin-mediated cell death [19] .

6|chunk|On the other hand, genetic and cell biology studies identified two classes of proteins required for MT fission process. In mammals, the GTPase dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1) [20] , is described to be the major effector of this process. Considering the cytosolic localization of this protein, its recruitment to the mitochondrial surface requires specific adaptor proteins on the MOM (Figure 1 ). So far, this second class of proteins includes Fis1, Mff, MiD49 and MiD51 (FISsion 1 protein, Mitochondrial Fission Factor, and Mitochondrial Dynamics protein 49/51; Figure 1 ) [21] .
