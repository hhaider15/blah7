3|chunk|The seroprevalence study was done from the random sampling (n=1000) of blood collected from 29 dual-purpose herds, located in three municipalities (Aguachica, Rio de Oro, and La Gloria) of Cesar department. The presence of antibodies against bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BHV-1), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), and bovine parainfluenza-3 virus (BPI-3V) in the samples was detected by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Epidemiological data were obtained using a questionnaire administered to the owner or manager of each herd.

4|chunk|The overall highest seroprevalence was observed for BHV-1 (94.7%), followed by BRSV (98.6%), BVDV (35.2%), and BPI-3V (47.1%). Regarding the seroprevalence by municipalities, there was a statistical association (p<0.05) for BVDV; however, for BRSV, BHV-1, and BPI-3V, no statistical association was found (p>0.05) between seropositive values and the municipalities, indicating that animal was seropositive in similar proportions in the three municipalities. Female sex and older animals (>24 months) were a significant risk factor for BHV-1 and BPI-3V infection. Regarding the clinical signs, there was a statistical association (p<0.05) between the seropositive values of BVDV and most of clinical signs observed, except for abortion.

5|chunk|This research confirms the high seroprevalence of the respiratory viral pathogens in nonvaccinated cattle within the study areas. Therefore, appropriate sanitary management practices and routine vaccination programs should be adopted to reduce the seroprevalence of these infectious agents.
