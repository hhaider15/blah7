1|chunk|Rationale: There is a high prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in patients with Pierre Robin sequence (PRS), and treatment approaches are highly variable. One approach is a temporary tongue-lip adhesion (TLA) that acts as a temporizing measure while the mandible continues to grow and is usually taken down at 1 year of age. Patient concerns: Side effects of prolonged tongue-lip adhesion and optimal workup and treatment of persistent OSA in the setting of a tongue-lip adhesion. Diagnoses: Pierre Robin sequence (PRS), persistent obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and tongue-lip adhesion (TLA). Interventions: Mandibular distraction osteogenesis (MDO), adenotonsillectomy, and tongue-lip adhesion takedown. Outcomes: Resolution of OSA. Lessons: This case puts into question the efficacy of isolated TLA in infants with Pierre Robin sequence and OSA, and places emphasis on the importance of considering an earlier workup of other potential causes of obstruction and the potential need for MDO as a primary or adjunctive approach to treatment.
