1|chunk|ATP synthase is powered by the flow of protons through the molecular turbine composed of two -helical integral membrane proteins, subunit a, which makes a stator, and a cylindrical rotor assembly made of multiple copies of subunit c. Transient protonation of a universally conserved carboxylate on subunit c (D61 in E. coli) gated by the electrostatic interaction with arginine on subunit a (R210 in E. coli) is believed to be a crucial step in proton transfer across the membrane. We used a fusion protein consisting of subunit a and the adjacent helices of subunit c to test by NMR spectroscopy if cD61 and aR210 are involved in an electrostatic interaction with each other, and found no evidence of such interaction. We have also determined that R140 does not form a salt bridge with either D44 or D124 as was suggested previously by mutation analysis. Our results demonstrate the potential of using arginines as NMR reporter groups for structural and functional studies of challenging membrane proteins.

2|chunk|Integral membrane proteins remain a challenging target for structural biology. Among more than 100,000 entries in PDB, there are only about 700 unique structures of membrane proteins. Therefore methods that probe the local structure remain important, in addition to X-ray crystallography and cryoelectron microscopy, which can yield high-resolution structures of the entire membrane proteins. Among these methods, solution NMR is particularly informative due to its ability to resolve signals of chemically distinct atoms in the protein. Complete protein structure determination by NMR requires resonance assignment of most hydrogen, carbon and nitrogen nuclei in the protein molecule. Although several structures of polytopic -helical membrane proteins, such as disulfide oxidoreductase DsbB 1 and sensory rhodopsin 2 , have been solved by NMR, in general, such proteins are very difficult targets for NMR structure determination in solution due to the detrimental effects of fast relaxation in detergent micelles and chemical shift degeneracy. Fortunately, NMR spectroscopy can provide useful, if limited, structural information, even in the situations where only few resonances can be assigned. In the present work, we used NMR to probe the structural and functional role of arginine residues in subunit a of ATP synthase.

3|chunk|In the cell, ATP synthase makes ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate. This process is driven by the proton motive or sodium motive force. In E. coli, the reaction is physiologically reversible and can generate transmembrane proton gradient using the energy of ATP hydrolysis. ATP synthase is composed of the F 1 -complex protruding into the cytoplasm, and the F 0 -complex immersed into the cell membrane 3 . ATP synthesis or hydrolysis in the active sites located in the F 1 -complex is coupled to the ion flow through the F 0 -complex.

4|chunk|In E. coli, the F 0 -complex is built of subunits a, b, and c combined in the ratio of ab 2 c 10 4 . ATP synthase represents an ion-driven molecular turbine. Protons flowing through the F 0 -complex drive the rotor built of multiple copies of subunit c 5 , and connected to an elongated shaft made of F 1 -subunits  and . The tip of subunit  rotates inside the F 1 core made of three pairs of subunits  and , causing sequential conformational changes in the three catalytic sites on the -subunits. Conformational transitions in the catalytic sites lead to the tight binding of ADP and phosphate and then to the release of the newly synthesized ATP molecules through the binding change mechanism 6,7 .
