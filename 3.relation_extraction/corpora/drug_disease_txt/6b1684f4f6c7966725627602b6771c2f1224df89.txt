1|chunk|Objectives: To analyze trends in mortalities and causes of death among under-5 children in Beijing, China between 1992 and 2015, and to forecast U5MRs in the period of 2016-2020.

2|chunk|Methods: This is an entire population-based epidemiological study. Data was collected based on "Children's Death Reporting Card" through Beijing Under-5 mortality rate Surveillance Network. Trends in mortality rates and leading causes of death were analyzed using statistical description and chi-square test with SPSS 19.0. An ARIMA model was fitted to forecast the U5MRs between 2016 and 2020 with EViews 8.0.

3|chunk|: During 1992-2015, a total of 1,881,952 livebirths and 12,541 deaths were under surveillance. Mortality rates in neonates, infants and under-5 children had overall decreasing trends (P<0.01) from 1992 to 2015, decreasing by 84.06%, 80.04% and 80.17%. However, U5MR increased 7.20% from 2013 to 2015. Birth asphyxia, congenital heart disease, prematurity/low birth weight and other congenital abnormalities were in the top 5 causes of death during 24 years. The greatest and fastest rate reduction was pneumonia which reduced 92.26% with AARR of 10.53%. However, distribution of death causes was different in children of different ages. Accidental asphyxia and septicemia were in the top 5 of death in 28 days-1 years old children, whereas for children 1-4 years old was accidental death. U5MRs in Beijing are projected to be 2.88, 2.87, 2.90, 2.97 and 3.09 in the period of 2016-2020 through the predictive model. Conclusion: Beijing has achieved great progress in reducing U5MRs from 1992 to 2015. However, U5MRs may show a slightly upward trend from 2016 to 2020 as influenced by the "Selective Two-child Policy". The future points of child health care are the management of birth asphyxia, congenital heart disease, prematurity/low birth weight and other congenital abnormalities. Importantly, specific prevention measures should be implemented for children in different age groups. 36(1):41-6. 18. Liu X, Liu G, Wang P, et al.
