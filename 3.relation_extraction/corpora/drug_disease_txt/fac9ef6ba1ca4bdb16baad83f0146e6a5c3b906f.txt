2|chunk|B. HLA-stability ELISA results for soluble HLA-B*40:01 molecules that were ligand-exchanged with 9-, 10-, 11-mers truncated peptides from SARS NP44 15-mer peptide. Non-irradiated HLA with conditional ligand and no peptide added (-UV), irradiated HLA and no peptide added (+UV), or with indicated 9-, 10-, 11-mers peptides. Peptides are labeled as capable (red bars) or incapable (white bars) of stabilizing the corresponding HLA.
