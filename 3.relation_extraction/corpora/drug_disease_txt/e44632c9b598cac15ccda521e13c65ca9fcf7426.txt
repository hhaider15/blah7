0|chunk|The Healthy Infant Nasal Transcriptome: A Benchmark Study OPEN

1|chunk|Responses by resident cells are likely to play a key role in determining the severity of respiratory disease. However, sampling of the airways poses a significant challenge, particularly in infants and children. Here, we report a reliable method for obtaining nasal epithelial cell RNA from infants for genome-wide transcriptomic analysis, and describe baseline expression characteristics in an asymptomatic cohort. Nasal epithelial cells were collected by brushing of the inferior turbinates, and gene expression was interrogated by RNA-seq analysis. Reliable recovery of RNA occurred in the absence of adverse events. We observed high expression of epithelial cell markers and similarity to the transcriptome for intrapulmonary airway epithelial cells. We identified genes displaying low and high expression variability, both inherently, and in response to environmental exposures. The greatest gene expression differences in this asymptomatic cohort were associated with the presence of known pathogenic viruses and/or bacteria. Robust bacteria-associated gene expression patterns were significantly associated with the presence of Moraxella. In summary, we have developed a reliable method for interrogating the infant airway transcriptome by sampling the nasal epithelium. Our data demonstrates both the fidelity and feasibility of our methodology, and describes normal gene expression and variation within a healthy infant cohort.

2|chunk|Sampling of the airway for research or diagnostic biospecimens in diseased infants is highly challenging. As compared to the tremendous progress made over the last decades in our understanding of adult lung diseases such as COPD and lung fibrosis 1-3 , this limitation has restricted progress in identifying the molecular mechanisms contributing to pediatric respiratory diseases. Many contemporary studies sample the upper airway, using aspirates of tracheal secretions in intubated subjects to collect intra-airway inflammatory cells and sloughed resident cells of the airway. The availability of these samples is limited to intubated subjects, introducing significant selection bias. Furthermore, the ability of these samples to reliably capture the cellular and molecular state of the lung is unclear. Other studies have analyzed nasal washings, which can be performed in a more broad population. Again, these samples are of unclear relevance to the pathophysiology of the lung.

3|chunk|Brushings of nasal epithelial cells have been used for decades to diagnose primary ciliary dyskenesis (PCD), indicating that recovery of epithelial cells from the nose of non-acutely ill children and infants could provide molecular information that reflects abnormalities of physiological relevance in the distal airway. Furthermore, nasal brushings in adults and older pediatric patients have previously been used for interrogation of the transcriptome. These studies have generally shown that nasal brushings broadly capture gene expression with relevance to the airways 4 , and can detect disease-associated changes in gene expression 5 .

4|chunk|We undertook the present study to determine if the recovery of nasal epithelial cells for transcriptomic analysis was feasible, and whether these data could provide molecular information of relevance to the more distal airways. We present a reliable procedure for sampling resident cells of the airway in healthy young infants, which is applicable to infants experiencing respiratory infectious disease (T. Mariani, unpublished observations), and likely to older ill and healthy pediatric subjects. Furthermore, we provide a benchmark healthy infant nasal transcriptome (HINT) data set, describing baseline expression and natural variation, for asymptomatic subjects. Our data demonstrates that it is technically feasible to quantify genome-wide RNA expression from young infant's airways, which may be helpful in the evaluation of host responses to diseased states.

5|chunk|Subject Demographics and RNA-Seq Data Generation. Fifty-three healthy, full-term infants were recruited at birth. A majority of the subjects were female, predominantly Caucasian, and had a mean gestational age of 39.3  1.0 (mean  SD) weeks, with a mean birth weight of 3.3  0.4 kg (Table 1) . Nasal brushing samples were obtained from the inferior nasal turbinate at approximately one month of age (see Methods). All samples were collected when infants were free of illness, specifically signs of respiratory infection or fever.

6|chunk|RNA was purified for high throughput sequence analysis from the recovered nasal cells as outlined in Fig. 1 . RNA yields from the nasal brushings were variable with a mean recovery of 278.5  436.7 ng (Fig. 2) . Due to variability in total RNA recovery, cDNA was generated from approximately 1 ng input RNA. As shown in Fig. 2 , the samples generated an average of 27  6 million total reads, with 66  14% displaying unique mapping to the human genome. After excluding genes whose expression was not robustly and reliably detected across subjects (see Methods), 13,978 genes or 63  7% of the genome was transcriptionally represented in these samples.
