1|chunk|We have previously described the use of a double coated agarose-agarose porcine islet macrobead for the treatment of type I diabetes mellitus. In the current study, the long-term viral safety of macrobead implantation into pancreatectomized diabetic dogs treated with pravastatin ( = 3) was assessed while 2 dogs served as nonimplanted controls. A more gradual return to preimplant insulin requirements occurred after a 2nd implant procedure (days 148, 189, and >652) when compared to a first macrobead implantation (days 9, 21, and 21) in all macrobead implanted animals. In all three implanted dogs, porcine C-peptide was detected in the blood for at least 10 days following the first implant and for at least 26 days following the second implant. C-peptide was also present in the peritoneal fluid of all three implanted dogs at 6 months after 2nd implant and in 2 of 3 dogs at necropsy. Prescreening results of islet macrobeads and culture media prior to transplantation were negative for 13 viruses. No evidence of PERV or other viral transmission was found throughout the study. This study demonstrates that the long-term (2.4 years) implantation of agaroseagarose encapsulated porcine islets is a safe procedure in a large animal model of type I diabetes mellitus.

Alternatively, the insulinproducing islets can be isolated from the majority of the pancreas and transplanted alone as free islets [2]. As noted above, a necessary component of the transplantation of an allogeneic pancreas or the islets alone is the need for lifelong immunosuppressive therapy. Because complications from such immunosuppressive therapy can include increased susceptibility to infections, malignancy, neurotoxicity, and nephrotoxicity, allotransplantation must be carefully considered and is often not suitable for young patients [3] . Further, the availability of human donor pancreas is extremely limited with only about 2,000 pancreas donors per year [4]. Worse,
