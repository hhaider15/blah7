1|chunk|In 2012 and 2013, influenza virus genome sequences of two new influenza A virus (IAV) subtypes were discovered in bat specimens, but further characterization was largely impeded by the lack of infectious virus. With the identification of highly susceptible cell lines, reconstitution of infectious bat IAV by reverse genetics recently succeeded and allowed a first insight into the life cycle of these viruses. Although there is a certain degree of functional compatibility between bat and conventional influenza A virus proteins, there are striking differences, including receptor usage, polarity of infection and reassortment potential.
