4|chunk|Results 226 studies from 50 countries met our inclusion criteria. Mortality associated with H1N1related critical illness was 31% (95% CI 28-34). Reported mortality was highest in South Asia (61% [95% CI 50-71]) and Sub-Saharan Africa (53% [95% CI 29-75]), in comparison to Western Europe (25% [95% CI 22-30]), North America (25% [95% CI 22-27]) and Australia (15% [95% CI 13-18]) (P<0.0001). High income economies had significantly lower

Mortality for the first wave was non-significantly higher than wave two (P = 0.66).
