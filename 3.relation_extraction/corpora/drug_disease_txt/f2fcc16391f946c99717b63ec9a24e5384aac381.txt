1|chunk|because of short half-life, drug resistance and cross-reactivity with the preexisting antibodies in HIV-infected patients. Using an artificial peptide strategy, we designed a peptide with non-native protein sequence, AP3, which exhibited potent antiviral activity against a broad spectrum of HIV-1 strains, including those resistant to T20, and had remarkably longer in vivo half-life than T20. While the preexisting antibodies in HIV-infected patients significantly suppressed T20's antiviral activity, these antibodies neither recognized AP3, nor attenuated its anti-HIV-1 activity. Structurally different from T20, AP3 could fold into single-helix and interact with gp41 NHR. The two residues, Met and Thr, at the N-terminus of AP3 form a hook-like structure to stabilize interaction between AP3 and NHR helices. Therefore, AP3 has potential for further development as a new HIV fusion inhibitor with improved antiviral efficacy, resistance profile and pharmacological properties over enfuvirtide.

2|chunk|The envelope glycoprotein (Env) of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) includes the gp120 surface subunit and the gp41 transmembrane subunit. As a class I transmembrane protein, gp41 plays a significant role in the membrane fusion and virus entry of HIV-1 1,2 . After the binding of the gp120 to the cellular receptors, gp41 undergoes conformation changes after fusion peptide (FP) inserts into the
