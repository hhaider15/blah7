1|chunk|Aims-Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)-A is highly expressed in diverse human malignant tumors, parallel to aggressive metastatic disease, resistance to radiation/chemotherapy and clinically poor outcome. Although this enzyme constitutes a plausible target in treatment of advanced cancer, there are few known LDH-A inhibitors.

2|chunk|Study Design-In this work, we utilized a high-throughput enzyme micro-array format to screen and evaluate > 900 commonly used medicinal plant extracts (0.00001-.5 mg/ml) for capacity to inhibit activity of recombinant full length human LDHA; EC .1.1.1.27.

3|chunk|Methodology-The protein sequence of purified enzyme was confirmed using 1D gel electrophoresis-MALDI-TOF-MS/MS, enzyme activity was validated by oxidation of NADH (500M) and kinetic inhibition established in the presence of a known inhibitor (Oxalic Acid).

4|chunk|the natural extracts tested, the lowest IC 50 s [<0.001 mg/ml] were obtained by: Chinese Gallnut (Melaphis chinensis gallnut), Bladderwrack (Fucus vesiculosus), Kelp (Laminaria Japonica) and Babul (Acacia Arabica). Forty-six additional herbs contained significant LDH-A inhibitory properties with IC 50 s [<0.07 mg/ml], some of which have common names of Arjun, Pipsissewa, Cinnamon, Pink Rose Buds/Petals, Wintergreen, Cat's Claw, Witch Hazel Root and Rhodiola Root.

5|chunk|Conclusion-These findings reflect relative potency by rank of commonly used herbs and plants that contain human LDH-A inhibitory properties. Future research will be required to isolate chemical constituents within these plants responsible for LDH-A inhibition and investigate potential therapeutic application.
