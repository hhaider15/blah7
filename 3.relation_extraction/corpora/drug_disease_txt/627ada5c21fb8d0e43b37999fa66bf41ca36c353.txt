1|chunk|, which first broken out in Jeddah in 2012, causes a severe acute respiratory illness with a high mortality rate. To better understand the molecular characteristics of isolated MERS-CoV genomes, we first analysed the codon usage pattern of the zoonotic MERS-CoV strains comprehensively to gain an insight into the mechanism of cross-species transmission. We found that MERS human/camel isolates showed a low codon usage bias. Both mutation and nature selection pressure have contributed to this low codon usage bias, with the former being the main determining factor. We also observed that gene function, evolution time and the different host species of the virus all contributed to the bias of MERS-CoV, to some extent. Additionally, the codon usage pattern of MERS-CoV isolates is different from other related Nidovirales viruses isolated from bats and hedgehogs. In the future, more epidemiological surveys are required to examine the factors that resulted in the emergence and outbreak of this virus.

2|chunk|Previous study also showed that the MERS-CoV species and HCoV-229E-related lineage co-circulated in Saudi Arabia, and they found a recombinant lineage of MERS-CoV that is endemic in camels [5] . The recombinant viruses led to an outbreak of MERS-CoV in humans in 2015 [6] . The evolution rate and recombination rate of coronavirus is increasing, such as MERS-CoV [4], therefore, it's significantly important to study the evolution and the influencing factors of MERS-CoV.

3|chunk|Codon usage bias is an important indicator of genome evolution. There are several factors that might influence the codon usage bias, including natural selection, mutational pressure, G+C content, secondary protein structure and replication selective transcription www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget/
