0|chunk|Can long-term historical data from electronic medical records improve surveillance for epidemics of acute respiratory infections? A systematic evaluation

1|chunk|As the deployment of electronic medical records (EMR) expands, so is the availability of long-term datasets that could serve to enhance public health surveillance. We hypothesized that EMR-based surveillance systems that incorporate seasonality and other long-term trends would discover outbreaks of acute respiratory infections (ARI) sooner than systems that only consider the recent past.
