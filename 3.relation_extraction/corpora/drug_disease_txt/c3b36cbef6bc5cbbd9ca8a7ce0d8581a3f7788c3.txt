The abbreviated feature name is inside the brackets following the full name. Mutation site, sequence features 1. Entropy of superfamily (EntropySuper): Superfamily alignment was obtained from the SAM-T02 web server [1]. Entropy was calculated as ! "

6|chunk|3. Entropy of subfamily (EntropySub): Subfamily alignment was constructed manually from the superfamily by including ten orthologs having the highest sequence identity to the query. The entropy formula is same as above. 4. Relative entropy of subfamily (RelEntropySub): The above relative entropy formula was applied to the subfamily alignment. 5. Positional hidden Markov model conservation score (PHC): The score was computed by the formula:
