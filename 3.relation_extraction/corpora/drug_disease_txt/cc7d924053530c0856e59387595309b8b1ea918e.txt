0|chunk|A multicompartment SIS stochastic model with zonal ventilation for the spread of nosocomial infections: detection, outbreak management and infection control Supplementary Material

1|chunk|In this supplementary material we show how our methodology can be implemented for a different hospital ward to that in [1, Figure 2 ]. We consider a hospital ward with six rooms with patients allocated across these rooms in an asymmetrical way. In particular, rooms 1, 3 and 5 contain one patient each, while rooms 2, 4 and 6 contain three patients each. We consider a number of ventilation settings (SA, SB, SC and SD), and carry out a number of numerical simulations to explore how airflow dynamics interplay with other factors related to infection spread, such as outbreak detection. The main aim is: (i) to show how our methodology can easily be extended to any hospital ward structure by appropriately modifying the ventilation matrix V; and (ii) to show how, while some of our conclusions in [1] seem to be valid also for the hospital ward structure considered in this supplementary material, others might highly depend on the particular ward structure under study.
