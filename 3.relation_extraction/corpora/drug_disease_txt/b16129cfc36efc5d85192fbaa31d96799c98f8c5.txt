6|chunk|Acid derivative S2 (100 mg, 0.31 mmol) was dissolved in 2 ml of CH2Cl2. Pyrrolidine (28.5 l, 1.10 equiv), hydroxybenzotriazole (46 mg, 1.1 equiv), diisopropylethylamine (119 l, 2.2 equiv) and 1-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]-3-ethylcarbodiimide (60 l, 1.1 equiv) were added successively and the reaction mixture was stirred for 20 h at room temperature. The reaction mixture was concentrated and 100 ml of AcOEt was added. The organic phase was washed with saturated NaHCO3, 10% citric acid and brine, then dried over Na2SO4, filtered and
