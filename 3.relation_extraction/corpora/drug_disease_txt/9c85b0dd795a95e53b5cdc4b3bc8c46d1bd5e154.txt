2|chunk|A total of 371 swabs and organ samples were collected from four types of chicken including layer, Sonali (local), broiler, and broiler breeder under eight districts (Rangpur, Bogura, Tangail, Dhaka, Gazipur, Mymensingh, Jamalpur, and Cumilla) during 2014-2016 in Bangladesh.

3|chunk|Out of 371 samples, 65 samples were positive in reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for molecular identification of IBV. The overall prevalence was 17.52% recorded and among the selected types of chicken, the highest prevalence of IBV was found in layer that was 42.22% followed by 17.24% in Sonali, 14.93% in broiler breeder, and lowest prevalence was 11.94% in broiler chicken, respectively. Moreover, the prevalence of IBV was recorded highest in aged chicken at 41-60 weeks, which was 54.55% in layer, 27.27% in Sonali, and, afterward, 14.68% was found in broiler breeder, respectively. Frequency of IBV more frequently in winter (22.67%) followed by rainy (15.87%) and summer season (11.58%). The highest prevalence of IBV was found Tangail district (41.67%) followed by Mymensingh (24.42%), Gazipur (19.32%), Dhaka (15.38%), Jamalpur (16.67%), Bogura (13.68%), Cumilla (5.88%), and Rangpur (9.26%), respectively. Samples that were found high positive in IBV RT-PCR (Ct value below 30) were subjected to inoculation into chicken egg embryo to observe characteristic changes in chicken embryo. Swabs and organ samples were processed and passaged in 9-day-old embryonated chicken eggs through allantoic cavity route. IBV virus suspected samples inoculated into chicken egg embryos after 3-5 passages showed dwarfing and curling of the embryos which are characteristic lesions of IBV. Allantoic fluid was collected from all inoculated eggs and performed partial sequencing of S1 gene for three isolates. After sequencing, the phylogenetic tree was constructed from the nucleotide sequences of IBV isolates. Two of the isolates are 4/91 IBV and another one matched with QX-like IBV.
