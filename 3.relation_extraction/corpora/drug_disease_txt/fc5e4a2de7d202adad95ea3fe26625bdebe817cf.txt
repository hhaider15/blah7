1|chunk|The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is the primary mechanism by which intracellular proteins, transcription factors, and many proteotoxic proteins with aggregation-prone structures are degraded. The UPS is reportedly downregulated in various neurodegenerative disorders, with increased proteasome activity shown to be beneficial in many related disease models. Proteasomes function under tonic inhibitory conditions, possibly via the ubiquitin chain-trimming function of USP14, a proteasome-associated deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB). We identified three specific RNA aptamers of USP14 (USP14-1, USP14-2, and USP14-3) that inhibited its deubiquitinating activity. The nucleotide sequences of these non-cytotoxic USP14 aptamers contained conserved GGAGG motifs, with G-rich regions upstream, and similar secondary structures. They efficiently elevated proteasomal activity, as determined by the increased degradation of small fluorogenic peptide substrates and physiological polyubiquitinated Sic1 proteins. Additionally, proteasomal degradation of tau proteins was facilitated in the presence of the UPS14 aptamers in vitro. Our results indicate that these novel inhibitory UPS14 aptamers can be used to enhance proteasome activity, and to facilitate the degradation of proteotoxic proteins, thereby protecting cells from various neurodegenerative stressors.

2|chunk|Proteasomes are the primary proteolytic machinery used by cells for homeostasis of various regulatory proteins. This catabolic process is mainly mediated by ubiquitin (Ub)-dependent proteolysis, but when the proteins are intrinsically disordered proteins, they can be degraded by proteasomes in a Ub-independent manner 1 . The 26S proteasome is a multimeric complex, composed of a 28-subunit core particle (CP or 20S complex) and a 19-subunit regulatory particle (RP, PA700, or 19S complex) 2 . The RP recognizes the polyubiquitin (polyUb) chains of its substrates, deubiquitinates them before proteasomal proteolysis is initiated, and translocates the substrates to the catalytic cavity of the CP.

3|chunk|The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) appears to have its own quality control mechanisms, one of which is accomplished by the proteasome-associated deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) USP14 and UCH37 3 . UPS14 interacts with RPN1, while UCH37 binds to ADRM1/RPN13 4,5 . Both are located on the RP, relatively far from the substrate entry pore and the Ub receptors RPN1 and RPN10. UPS14 and UCH37 are thought to mediate stepwise disassembly of the Ub chain from the distal end 6 . This "chain-trimming" effect can delay proteasomal degradation by weakening the interaction between the Ub receptors of the proteasomes, and the polyUb chains of the substrates. Deletion of the USP14 gene, or chemical treatment with USP14 inhibitors, results in accelerated proteasomal degradation of various target substrates 7 . These findings suggest that USP14 is a potential therapeutic target for treating diseases where toxic proteins accumulate. However, it has also been reported that the trimming of Ub chains might promote proteasomal degradation 8 . The mechanism regulating this remains to be elucidated, but probably involves the rate of Ub chain-trimming on the proteasome in coordination with substrate translocation.

4|chunk|Aptamers are molecules composed of single-stranded nucleic acids (15-50 bases) that have been generated by an in vitro selection process from a large pool of random sequences. This technique is known as systemic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) 9,10 . Since the introduction of SELEX technology, a wide range of biological targets, including small molecules, peptides, proteins, nucleic acids, cells, tissues and organisms, have been reported to bind to aptamers with high specificity. Aptamers are often referred to as "chemical antibodies, " and are one of only a few classes of biomolecules that can be manufactured to bind to multiple different targets. RNA aptamers have been isolated and shown to have stable conformations in vivo, following some modification. They can specifically bind to proteins such as human immunodeficiency virus Tat 11 , reverse transcriptase 12 , hepatitis C virus NS3 protease/helicase 13,14 , NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 15 , and severe acute respiratory syndrome NTPase/helicase 16 . In addition, RNA aptamers can bind to prostate cancer cells through the extracellular portion of the prostate-specific membrane antigen 17 , and to brain tissue 18 .

5|chunk|Aptamers that bind to specific proteins can repress the enzymatic activity of those proteins or protein-protein interactions. The active sites or interacting motifs usually offer more exposed heteroatoms, which mediates hydrogen bonds or other strong interactions with the aptamers 19 . For therapeutic applications, inhibitory aptamers are often chemically modified to be resistant to degradation mediated by serum. The age-related macular degeneration drug pegaptanib is a 27-nt aptamer that targets vascular endothelial growth factor. It is conjugated with 40 kDa polyethylene glycol and contains inverted nucleotides at the 3 terminus 20 . Considering the rapid progress in aptamer biology and related technologies, aptamers are now considered essential for understanding and modulating various pathophysiological processes.

6|chunk|To overcome the limitation of small-molecule USP14 inhibitors, we identified three novel USP14-binding RNA aptamers that suppressed the deubiquitinating activity of USP14 in vitro. Consistent with the effects of USP14 upon the proteasome, these USP14 aptamers enhanced proteasome activity, and facilitated the degradation of Alzheimer's disease (AD)-implicated tau proteins. The inhibitory USP14 aptamers were non-cytotoxic and effectively relieved proteopathic stress in cultured cells. Therefore, UPS14 aptamers could offer an interesting alternative to delay the aggregation process of toxic, aggregation-prone proteins.
