0|chunk|Multicenter Evaluation of BioFire FilmArray Respiratory Panel 2 for Detection of Viruses and Bacteria in Nasopharyngeal Swab Samples

1|chunk|The FilmArray Respiratory Panel 2 (RP2) is a multiplex in vitro diagnostic test for the simultaneous and rapid (45-min) detection of 22 pathogens directly from nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) samples. It contains updated (and in some instances redesigned) assays that improve upon the FilmArray Respiratory Panel (RP; version 1.7), with a faster run time. The organisms identified are adenovirus, coronavirus 229E, coronavirus HKU1, coronavirus NL63, coronavirus OC43, human metapneumovirus, human rhinovirus/enterovirus, influenza virus A, influenza virus A H1, influenza virus A H1-2009, influenza virus A H3, influenza virus B, parainfluenza virus 1, parainfluenza virus 2, parainfluenza virus 3, parainfluenza virus 4, respiratory syncytial virus, Bordetella pertussis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae.

2|chunk|Two new targets are included in the FilmArray RP2: Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and Bordetella parapertussis. This study provides data from a multicenter evaluation of 1,612 prospectively collected NPS samples, with performance compared to that of the FilmArray RP or PCR and sequencing. The overall percent agreement between the FilmArray RP2 and the comparator testing was 99.2%. The RP2 demonstrated a positive percent agreement of 91.7% or greater for detection of all but three analytes: coronavirus OC43, B. parapertussis, and B. pertussis. The Film-Array RP2 also demonstrated a negative percent agreement of 93.8% for all analytes. Of note, the adenovirus assay detects all genotypes, with a demonstrated increase in sensitivity. The FilmArray RP2 represents a significant improvement over the FilmArray RP, with a substantially shorter run time that could aid in the diagnosis of respiratory infections in a variety of clinical scenarios.
