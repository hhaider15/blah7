1|chunk|Fatal Ebola virus infection is characterized by a systemic inflammatory response similar to septic shock. Ebola glycoprotein (GP) is involved in this process through activating dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages. However, the mechanism is unclear. Here, we showed that LSECtin (also known as CLEC4G) plays an important role in GP-mediated inflammatory responses in human DCs. Anti-LSECtin mAb engagement induced TNF- and IL-6 production in DCs, whereas silencing of LSECtin abrogated this effect. Intriguingly, as a pathogenderived ligand, Ebola GP could trigger TNF- and IL-6 release by DCs through LSECtin. Mechanistic investigations revealed that LSECtin initiated signaling via association with a 12-kDa DNAX-activating protein (DAP12) and induced Syk activation. Mutation of key tyrosines in the DAP12 immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif abrogated LSECtinmediated signaling. Furthermore, Syk inhibitors significantly reduced the GP-triggered cytokine production in DCs. Therefore, our results demonstrate that LSECtin is required for the GP-induced inflammatory response, providing new insights into the EBOV-mediated inflammatory response.

Ebola glycoprotein (GP) is thought to contribute to disease pathogenesis, as high amounts of shed GP from virus-infected cells are detected in patients, and activate macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) to produce proinflammatory cytokines.
