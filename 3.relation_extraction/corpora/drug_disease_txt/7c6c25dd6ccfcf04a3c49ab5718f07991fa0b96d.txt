1|chunk|Muscle wasting is one of the main features of cancer cachexia, a multifactorial syndrome frequently occurring in oncologic patients. The onset of cachexia is associated with reduced tolerance and response to antineoplastic treatments, eventually leading to clinical conditions that are not compatible with survival. Among the mechanisms underlying cachexia, protein and energy dysmetabolism play a major role. In this regard, several potential treatments have been proposed, mainly on the basis of promising results obtained in preclinical models. However, at present, no treatment yet reached validation to be used in the clinical practice, although several drugs are currently tested in clinical trials for their ability to improve muscle metabolism in cancer patients. Along this line, the results obtained in both experimental and clinical studies clearly show that cachexia can be effectively approached by a multidirectional strategy targeting nutrition, inflammation, catabolism, and inactivity at the same time. In the present study, approaches aimed to modulate muscle metabolism in cachexia will be reviewed.
