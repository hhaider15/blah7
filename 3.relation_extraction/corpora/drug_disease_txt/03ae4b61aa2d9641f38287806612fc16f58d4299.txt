0|chunk|causes of fever in Gabonese children: a cross-sectional hospital- based study

1|chunk|The causes of infections in pediatric populations differ between age groups and settings, particularly in the tropics. Such differences in epidemiology may lead to misdiagnosis and ineffective empirical treatment. Here, we investigated the current spectrum of pathogens causing febrile diseases leading to pediatric hospitalization in Lambarn, Gabon. From August 2015 to March 2016, we conducted a prospective, cross-sectional, hospital-based study in a provincial hospital. Patients were children  15 years with fever  38 C and required hospitalization. A total of 600 febrile patients were enrolled. Malaria was the main diagnosis found in 52% (311/600) patients. Blood cultures revealed septicemia in 3% (17/593), among them four cases of typhoid fever. The other causes of fever were heterogeneously distributed between both bacteria and viruses. Severe infections identified by Lambarn Organ Dysfunction Score (LODS) were also most often caused by malaria, but children with danger signs did not have more coinfections than others. In 6% (35/600) of patients, no pathogen was isolated. In Gabon, malaria is still the major cause of fever in children, followed by a bacterial and viral disease. Guidelines for both diagnosis and management should be tailored to the spectrum of pathogens and resources available locally.

2|chunk|Causes of fever in African pediatric populations are more diverse than previously thought. A landmark study conducted in Tanzania showed that due to a change in epidemiology, a broad spectrum of pathogens replaced P. falciparum malaria as the most common cause of disease in children in this area 1 . However, a few years later, P. falciparum malaria, is still seen to be the main cause of febrile illnesses in Ghana, West Africa 2 . When unaware, these differences in epidemiology might lead to misdiagnosis as well as inefficient treatment by the medical personnel. The process of medical diagnosis includes the joint interpretation of symptoms, clinical signs and laboratory findings. Careful selection and prioritization of a diagnostic setup are informed by a priori knowledge of the seasonal, local and worldwide frequency and distribution of a given disease 3,4 .

3|chunk|Our study describes the distribution of infections, co-infections, and co-morbidities in children hospitalized for febrile illnesses at the Albert Schweitzer Hospital (HAS) in Lambarn, Gabon, as an example for a hospital in a semiurban Central African region. In addition, we present the current spectrum of pathogens causing severe disease identified by Lambarn Organ Dysfunction Score (LODS) in these children.

4|chunk|Study patients. A total of 600 febrile patients  15 years were enrolled in our study. Of these, 280 (47%) were females; 69% (415/600) patients were < 5 years, and median (IQR) age was 29 [12-68] months (Table 1) . Seven percent (40/549, NA = 51) had at least one known chronic medical condition prior to admission, among the main ones: 4% (23/600) patients had homozygous sickle cell disease; 1% (6/600) were HIV positive. Vaccination coverage of the expanded program on immunization (EPI) vaccines was above 80% for scheduled doses of BCG, poliomyelitis and pentavalent (diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, hepatitis B and Haemophilus influenzae type b) vaccines, and 54% and 55% for measles and yellow fever vaccines, respectively ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ).

5|chunk|General condition. On admission, 4% (23/593, NA = 7) patients were prostrated. Malnutrition -defined by a weight-for-age Z-score < 2SD was found in 22% (132/600) patients. Table 2a depicts differences of clinical parameters that werefound statistically significant, in relation to major clinical signs.

6|chunk|Anemia was more pronounced in severely malnourished patients -having a weight-for-age Z-Score < 3SD, with a hemoglobin concentration of 8.3 g/dL versus 9.2 g/dL (p = 0.02) (Table 2b) .

7|chunk|Laboratory values and imaging. Laboratory values were mostly as expected for the respective clinical condition. Table 2b depicts differences of hematological parameters and liver function tests in relation to major clinical signs.

8|chunk|Chest radiography was done in children with respiratory signs and/or leucocytes 20,000/mm 3 as early as possible after admission (Fig. 1) .

9|chunk|Parasitology. Overall, 52% (311/600) patients were diagnosed with Plasmodium falciparum (P.f.) malaria, ten of them as mixed infections: seven P. malariae (P.m), three P. ovale curtisi (P.o.c.), and one P. ovale wallikeri (P.o.w.). One patient was infected with P.f., P.m., and P.o.c. at the same time.

10|chunk|PCR-screening for Babesia spp. was negative in all patients. Urine analysis revealed one Schistosoma haematobium infection.
