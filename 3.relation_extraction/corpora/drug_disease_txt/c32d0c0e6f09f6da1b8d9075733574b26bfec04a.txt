1|chunk|Pathogens exert selective pressure which may lead to substantial changes in host immune responses. The human complement receptor type 1 (CR1) is an innate immune recognition glycoprotein that regulates the activation of the complement pathway and removes opsonized immune complexes. CR1 genetic variants in exon 29 have been associated with expression levels, C1q or C3b binding and increased susceptibility to several infectious diseases. Five distinct CR1 nucleotide substitutions determine the Knops blood group phenotypes, namely Kn a/b , McC a/b , Sl1/Sl2, Sl4/Sl5 and KCAM+/-.

3|chunk|The distribution of the CR1 alleles, genotypes and haplotypes differed significantly among geographical settings (p 0.001). CR1 variants rs17047660A/G (McC a/b ) and rs17047661A/ G (Sl1/Sl2) were exclusively observed to be polymorphic in African populations compared to the groups from Asia and South-America, strongly suggesting that these two SNPs may be subjected to selection. This is further substantiated by a high linkage disequilibrium between the two variants in the Congolese and Ghanaian populations. A total of nine CR1 haplotypes PLOS ONE | https://doi.
