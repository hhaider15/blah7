2|chunk|Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) (Cell Applications, Atlanta, GA) or human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (hCMECs) (Applied Biological Materials, Richmond, BC, Canada) were grown in Endothelial Cell Growth Medium (Cell Applications, Atlanta, GA) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) with humidity in 5% CO2 at 37 C. The media was changed every 48 h. Cells were allowed to grow for up to 48 h until 90% confluence of the monolayer was achieved. Cells were maintained in Endothelial Cell Growth Medium during the experiments. Cell passages 3-6 were used for all experiments. African green monkey kidney epithelial Vero E6 cells (ATCC CRL-1586) were grown in Dulbeccos modified Eagles medium (DMEM) with 5% FBS with humidity in 5% CO2 at 37 C. Mouse primary brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) were isolated from brain tissues of pathogen-free laboratory 6-8-week-old C57BL/6 wild-type and Epac1-null mice using a published protocol [1]. BMECs were grown in Endothelial Cell Growth Medium (Cell Applications) supplemented with 10% FBS with humidity in 5% CO2 at 37 C. Cell passages 2-3 were used for all experiments.

3|chunk|EBOV (199510621 Zaire strain, GenBank accession number KR824526) and Marburg virus (200501379 Angola strain, GenBank accession number KU978782) stocks were propagated in Vero E6 cells in Earls modified Eagles medium (EMEM) with 2% FBS at 37 C. The freeze-thaw technique was used for virus harvesting. EBOV titers were calculated using tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) assays done in a microtiter format using four replicates at 10-fold serial dilutions (10 -2 to 10 -8 ). After an 11-day incubation period at 37 C, the cells were fixed with 10% buffered formalin overnight, and then stained with 0.5% crystal violet for 15 min. Virus titers were calculated using the method of Reed and Muench. All work with filoviruses was performed in the biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) facility of the Galveston National Laboratory.

4|chunk|The recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus expressing the glycoprotein (GP) of Zaire EBOV (strain Mayinga) (EGP-VSV) was kindly provided by Drs. Thomas Geisbert and Chad Mire (UTMB). Viral stocks were prepared in Vero E6 cells using DMEM with 2% fetal calf serum, and stored at 80C. The concentration of EGP-VSV was determined by plaque assay in Vero E6 cell monolayers under a 1.6% Tragacanth gum mixed with 2 DMEM medium (1:1) with 2% FBS overlay. Plaques of EGP-VSV were counted after staining with 0.25% crystal violet in 10% buffered formalin.

5|chunk|Total RNA from TriPure Isolation Reagent-diluted supernatants and cell samples was extracted according to the manufacturer's directions and resuspended with 20 L of diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC)-treated RNase-free water. RNA was quantified spectrophotometrically at 260 nm using a NanoDrop 2000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Samples of purified RNA were stored at 80C. One microgram of each RNA sample was reverse transcribed using the iScript reverse transcription supermix (BioRad, Hercules, CA) with an RNase inhibitor and random hexamer primers according to the manufacturer's instruction. Detection of EBOV was performed using a qPCR TaqMan assay that amplified an 80-bp fragment of the receptor binding and fusion glycoprotein gene fragment of EBOV-Zaire. The primers used were: 5-TTT TCA ATC CTC AAC CGT AAG GC-3 (forward) and 5-CAG TCC GGT CCC AGA ATG TG-3 (reverse), and probe FAM-CAT GTG CCG CCC CAT CGC TGC-BHQ1. cDNA samples were run on the Stratagene Mx3000P thermal cycler in a final volume of 20 L containing 1x TaqMan Fast Advanced Master Mix, 1 mol of each primer, 0.1 mol probe, and 100 ng template. The thermal profile for the reaction was: 50 C for 15 min, 95 C for 5 min, followed by 45 cycles of 95 C for 1 s, 60 C for 20 s, then 1 cycle of 40 C for 30 s. In each qPCR run, 10-fold serial dilutions of a standard (60,000 EBOV-Zaire Mayinga particles/L of RNA) were included to confirm the sensitivity of the qPCR method, and noninfected cells (mock) were used as a negative control. A standard curve was used to convert the threshold cycle value (Cq) to the number of RNA copies per milliliter of sample. For Marburg virus (MARV) detection, primers MN FP and MN RP, and probe MN P were used as previously described [2] . Ten-fold serial dilutions of MARV RNA (409,000 MARV-Ravn particles/l of RNA) were included as a standard and a positive control in each PCR run. Immunoblotting and Immunoprecipitation (IP)
