1|chunk|The CRISPR technology not only can knock out target genes by using the RNA-guided Cas9 nuclease but also can activate their expression when a nuclease-deficient Cas9 (dCas9) is employed. Using the latter function, we here show the effect of the CRISPR-mediated pinpoint activation of endogenous expression of BST-2 (also known as tetherin), a virus restriction factor with a broad antiviral spectrum. Single-guide RNA (sgRNA) sequences targeting the BST-2 promoter were selected by promoter assays. Potential sgRNAs and dCas9 fused to the VP64 transactivation domain, along with an accessory transcriptional activator complex, were introduced into cells by lentiviral transduction. Increased expression of BST-2 mRNA in transduced cells was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR. Cells in which BST-2 expression was highly enhanced showed the effective inhibition of HIV-1 production and replication even in the presence of the viral antagonist Vpu against BST-2. These findings confirm that the physiological stoichiometry between host restriction factors and viral antagonists may determine the outcome of the battle with viruses.

2|chunk|In the mid '90 s, the requirements of the so-called "accessory" (or "auxiliary") HIV proteins sthat had been long known to be nonessential for viral replication in in vitro culture were reported to depend on the cell-types used for infection experiments 1-6 . Since 2002, these cell-type-dependent requirements of accessory proteins have been explained by the discovery of HIV restriction factors that are present in a cell-type dependent manner. These findings have indicated that HIV replication in cells expressing specific restriction factors can be achieved only by using viral accessory proteins to counteract them and evade their inhibitory activity through a one-on-one confrontation, such as Vif versus APOBEC3 proteins 7-10 , Vpu versus BST-2/tetherin (referred to hereafter as BST-2) 11,12 , Vpx versus SAMHD1 13,14 , and Nef versus SERINC5 15,16 .

3|chunk|The transmembrane protein BST-2 potently acts by tethering to HIV particles present on the surface of virus-producing cells. This restriction factor is very peculiar in that, unlike the other three factors that specifically inhibit retroviral infections, BST-2 displays broad-spectrum activity against a variety of enveloped viruses as well as retroviruses, e.g., Marburg virus 17 , Lassa virus 17,18 , Ebola virus 19,20 , Sendai virus 21 , influenza virus 22,23 , herpes simplex virus 1 24 , Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus 25 , vesicular stomatitis virus 26 , chikungunya virus 27 , SARS corona virus 28 , hepatitis B virus 29 , and hepatitis C virus 30 , human parainfluenza virus 31 , almost all of which harbor different viral antagonists against BST-2. This suggests the importance of counteracting this restriction factor for efficient viral replication. Because several in vivo studies have implied that the stoichiometric balance between restriction factors and viral antagonists might determine disease progression 32-35 , targeting BST-2 to enhance its endogenous expression may provide new therapeutic strategies.
