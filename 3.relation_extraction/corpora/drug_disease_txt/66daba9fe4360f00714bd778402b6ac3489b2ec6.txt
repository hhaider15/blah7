1|chunk|Guanine-rich sequences can fold into four-stranded structures of stacked guanine-tetrads, so-called G-quadruplexes (G4). These unique motifs have been extensively studied on the DNA level; however, exploration of the biological roles of G4s at the RNA level is just emerging. Here we show that G4 RNA when introduced within coding regions are capable of stimulating 1 ribosomal frameshifting (1 FS) in vitro and in cultured cells. Systematic manipulation of the loop length between each G-tract revealed that the 1 FS efficiency positively correlates with G4 stability. Addition of a G4-stabilizing ligand, PhenDC3, resulted in higher 1 FS. Further, we demonstrated that the G4s can stimulate +1 FS and stop codon readthrough as well. These results suggest a potentially novel translational gene regulation mechanism mediated by G4 RNA.
