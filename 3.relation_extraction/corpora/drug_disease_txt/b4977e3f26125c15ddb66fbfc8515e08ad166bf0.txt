1|chunk|The genome sequences of four economically important shrimp viruses, Penaeus stylirostris densovirus 1, hepatopancreatic parvovirus, yellow head virus, and gill-associated virus, are reported here. Genome data are fundamental for epidemiological studies in determining the origins of these viruses detected for the first time in Egypt and in developing disease management strategies.
