1|chunk|Feline calicivirus (FCV) can cause painful oral ulcerations, salivation, gingivitis/stomatitis, fever and depression in infected cats; highly virulent virus variants can lead to fatal epizootic outbreaks. Viral transmission occurs directly or indirectly via fomites. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence and viability of FCV in the environment after sequential oronasal infections of specified pathogen-free cats with two FCV field strains in a research facility. Replicating virus was detected in saliva swabs from all ten cats after the first and in four out of ten cats after the second FCV exposure using virus isolation to identify FCV shedders. In the environment, where cleaning, but no disinfection took place, FCV viral RNA was detectable using RT-qPCR on all tested items and surfaces, including cat hair. However, only very limited evidence was found of replicating virus using virus isolation. Viral RNA remained demonstrable for at least 28 days after shedding had ceased in all cats. Disinfection with 5% sodium bicarbonate (and Incidin TM Plus) and barrier measures were effective in that no viral RNA was detectable outside the cat rooms. Our findings are important for any multicat environment to optimize hygienic measures against FCV infection.

2|chunk|Viruses 2019, 11, 958 2 of 16 assess the hygienic management [15] . In veterinary facilities or research catteries, nobody has so far investigated environmental contamination with FCV.

3|chunk|It was the aim of this study to investigate the presence and viability of FCV in the environment of a research cat facility following two sequential experimental infections of cats with two different FCV field strains. Oropharyngeal shedding of FCV was tested in parallel. The findings of this study are important to optimize the hygienic management of private practices and veterinary hospitals and to prevent accidental, iatrogenic FCV infections in cats.

5|chunk|In the experiment, 10 male cats, aged 8 weeks and from an approved specified pathogen-free (SPF) facility were used. All cats were group-housed in a confined university facility in four connected rooms (total of~37.2 m 2 ) under ethologically and hygienically ideal conditions [16] . All experiments were conducted according to Swiss law and were approved by the veterinary office of the canton of Zurich (TVB ZH095/15, issued 11 August 2015). After the arrival of the cats and prior to the start of the experiment, each cat was clinically examined, and blood and plasma samples and conjunctival, oropharyngeal, and rectal swabs were collected to verify the cats' SPF status. These samples were tested for FCV, feline leukemia virus (FeLV), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), hemoplasmas, parvovirus (FPV), herpesvirus 1 (FHV-1) and coronavirus (FCoV), as previously described [17] [18] [19] . The presence of Bartonella henselae, Chlamydia felis, Bordetella bronchiseptica and Mycoplasma felis was tested [3, 17, 18, 20] . Feline gammaherpesvirus (FcaGHV) [21] was tested by PCR with modifications as described in Novacco et al., 2019 [22]. In addition, the serum samples were tested for antibodies against feline calicivirus, feline herpesvirus, feline parvovirus and feline coronavirus by immunofluorescence assays as previously described [23, 24] , and for feline immunodeficiency virus by western blot [25] . All cats tested negative for all of these infections prior to the start of the experiment.
