0	59	67 Diarrhea	Disease	DOID_13250

1|chunk|A field porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) strain, JS2008, was isolated from stool samples of a piglet with acute diarrhea on a vaccinated farm in eastern China. We sequenced and analyzed the complete genome of strain JS2008, which will help increase our understanding of the molecular characteristics of the epidemic PEDV in China.
