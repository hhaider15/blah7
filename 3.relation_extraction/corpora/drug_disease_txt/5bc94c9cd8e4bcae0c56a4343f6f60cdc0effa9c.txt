1|chunk|Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) has emerged in Vietnam since 2009. Herein, full-length genome sequences are reported for three PEDV isolates from pigs displaying severe diarrhea from farms located in northern and southern provinces of Vietnam. The results provide more understanding of the molecular characteristics of PEDV in Vietnam.
