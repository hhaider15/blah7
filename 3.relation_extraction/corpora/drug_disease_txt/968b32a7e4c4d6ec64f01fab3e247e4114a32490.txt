1|chunk|Our studies also showed that SIRT1, histone acetyltransferase, and NF-B regulated the acetylation and release of HMGB1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation, dualluciferase reporter gene assay, and co-immunoprecipitation experiments illustrated that PEDV-N could induce HMGB1 transcription by interacting with C/EBP-, which could bind to C/EBP motif in HMGB1 promotor region. Collectively, our data indicate PEDV-N contributes to HMGB1 transcription and the subsequent release/acetylation of HMGB1 during PEDV infection.
