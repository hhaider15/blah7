7|chunk|In the EBCM approach,  t is the probability that a root node has not being infected by a neighbor at time t. This is possible if the neighbor is susceptible, recovered, or infected but has not transmitted the disease yet to the root, which happens with probabilities  S (t),  R (t) and  I (t), respectively. Then,  t =  S (t) +  I (t) +  R (t). The probability that a root node of connectivity k is susceptible is  k and the fraction of susceptible nodes is S(t) = k P (k) k t = G 0 ( t ). On the other hand, a neighbor is susceptible with 1
