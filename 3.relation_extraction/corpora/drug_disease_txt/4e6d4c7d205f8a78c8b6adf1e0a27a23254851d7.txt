1|chunk|ORF4b antagonizes the early antiviral alpha/beta interferon (IFN-/) response, which may significantly contribute to MERS-CoV pathogenesis; however, the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. Here, we found that ORF4b in the cytoplasm could specifically bind to TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and IB kinase epsilon (IKK), suppress the molecular interaction between mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) and IKK, and inhibit IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) phosphorylation and subsequent IFN- production. Further analysis showed that ORF4b could also inhibit IRF3 and IRF7-induced production of IFN-, whereas deletion of the nuclear localization signal of ORF4b abrogated its ability to inhibit IRF3 and IRF7-induced production of IFN-, but not IFN- production induced by RIG-I,

2|chunk|HCoVs have yet to be identified. MERS-CoV ORF4b antagonizes the early antiviral response, which may contribute to MERS-CoV pathogenesis. Here, we report the identification of the interferon (IFN) antagonism mechanism of MERS-CoV ORF4b. MERS-CoV ORF4b inhibits the production of type I IFN through a direct interaction with IKK /TBK1 in the cytoplasm, and also in the nucleus with unknown mechanism. These findings provide a rationale for the novel pathogenesis of MERS-CoV as well as a basis for developing a candidate therapeutic against this virus.
