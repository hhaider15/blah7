1|chunk|Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is a positive-stranded RNA virus that grows in macrophages and causes acute pneumonia in pigs. PRRSV causes devastating losses to the porcine industry. However, due to its high antigenic variability and poorly understood immunopathogenesis, there is currently no effective vaccine or treatment to control PRRSV infection. The common occurrence of PRRSV infection with bacterial infections as well as its inflammatory-driven pathobiology raises the question of the value of antibiotics with immunomodulating properties for the treatment of the disease it causes. The macrolide antibiotic Tulathromycin (TUL) has been found to exhibit potent anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating properties in cattle and pigs. The aim of this study was to characterize the anti-viral and immunomodulating properties of TUL in PRRSV-infected porcine macrophages. Our findings indicate that blood monocyte-derived macrophages are readily infected by PRRSV and can be used as an effective cellular model to study PRRSV pathogenesis. TUL did not change intracellular or extracellular viral titers, not did it alter viral receptors (CD163 and CD169) expression on porcine macrophages. In contrast, TUL exhibited potent immunomodulating properties, which therefore occurred in the absence of any direct antiviral effects against PRRSV. TUL had an additive effect with PRRSV on the induction of macrophage apoptosis, and inhibited virus-induced necrosis. TUL significantly attenuated PRRSV-induced macrophage pro-inflammatory signaling (CXCL-8 and mitochondrial ROS production) and prevented PRRSV inhibition of non-opsonized and opsonized phagocytic function. Together, these data demonstrate that TUL inhibits PRRSV-induced inflammatory responses in porcine macrophages and protects against the phagocytic impairment caused by the virus. Research in live pigs is warranted to assess the potential clinical benefits of this antibiotic in the context of virally induced inflammation and tissue injury. 3 / 28 treated with HBSS (control) or tulathromycin (0.5 mg/mL; TUL) for 1h, un-infected or infected with with PRRSV at an m.o.i. of 0.1 for 12 hours (Virus and TUL+ Virus). (A) Staining of cells by Diff Quick reveals that infection with PRRSV alters macrophage morphology by giving them a fibroblast-like appearance ("virus"). TUL treatment prevented these alterations ("TUL+Virus"). Representative microscopic images of 5 independent experiments; Bar = 50m. (B) Quantitative illustration of the observations shown in A, calculated as percentage of macrophages exhibiting morphological changes. At least 150 macrophages were counted for each experimental group. Data represent mean  SEM, n = 5 per group. # = P<0.05 vs control;  = P<0.05 vs TUL;  = P<0.05 vs virus.
