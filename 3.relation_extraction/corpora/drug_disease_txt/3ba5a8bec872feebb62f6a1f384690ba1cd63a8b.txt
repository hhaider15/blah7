1|chunk|To investigate the potential synergism in anti-tumoral efficacy of oncolytic and vaccine properties, we chose Ovalbumin and an ideal tumor antigen, claudin-6, for pre-clinical proof of concept. To enhance immunogenicity, both antigens were presented by retroviral virus-like particle produced in situ during MV-infection. All recombinant MV revealed normal growths, genetic stability, and proper expression and presentation of both antigens. Potent antigen-specific humoral and cellular immunity were found in immunized MV-susceptible IFNAR / -CD46Ge mice. These immune responses significantly inhibited metastasis formation or increased therapeutic efficacy compared to control MV in respective novel in vivo tumor models using syngeneic B16-hCD46/mCLDN6 murine melanoma cells. These data indicate the potential of MV to trigger selected tumor antigen-specific immune responses on top of direct tumor lysis for enhanced efficacy.

2|chunk|Despite significant advances in tumor therapy, the efficacy of classic therapeutic options like surgery, radio-, chemo-, or antibody-therapy for patients with advanced stage solid tumor entities remains limited. In the past few years, novel treatment options have been developed that prime the immune system for tumor cell eradication. Amongst these, the presentation of tumor-associated antigens (TAA) has been shown to be a promising approach to induce potent and persisting antigen-specific T-cell responses. For this purpose, immunotherapies aim to break tolerance of the immune system against endogenous self-or to even target patient-specific mutant neo-antigens 1 . Cancer vaccines already licensed or currently in clinical trials comprise several different antigenic formats including vaccines targeting HPV antigens as the causative agent of cervical carcinoma 2 , dendritic cells loaded with antigens/peptides 3 , antigen-adjuvant conjugates (e.g. Sipuleucel-T/Provenge  ) 4 , or antigen-encoding modified RNAs 5 .

3|chunk|Also viruses are considered as tumor-lytic cancer therapeutics. Application of unmodified wild-type viruses has only rarely been successful, but was sometimes accompanied by significant disease caused by the infection. The advent of recombinant DNA technologies allowed rational development of viruses tailored for the specific lysis of tumor cells, so called oncolytic viruses (OVs). OVs have been derived from at least nine different virus families and have broadly entered early to advanced phase clinical trials 6 . While OVs have originally been developed for direct tumor cell lysis due to their inherent cytotoxicity, the potential contribution of the immune system
