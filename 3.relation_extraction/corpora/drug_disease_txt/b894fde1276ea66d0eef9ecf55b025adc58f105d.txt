1|chunk|. The phospholipid content of the ER membrane differs from that of the plasma membrane (PM). The phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2 ) superfamily consists of a large number of members that specifically catalyse the hydrolysis of phospholipids at a particular position. Here we show that the CM-II isoform of secreted PLA 2 obtained from Naja mossambica mossambica snake venom (CM-II-sPLA 2 ) possesses potent virucidal (neutralising) activity against HCV, DENV and JEV, with 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC 50 ) of 0.036, 0.31 and 1.34 ng/ ml, respectively. In contrast, the IC 50 values of CM-II-sPLA 2 against viruses that bud through the PM (Sindbis virus, influenza virus and Sendai virus) or trans-Golgi network (TGN) (herpes simplex virus) were >10,000 ng/ml. Moreover, the 50% cytotoxic (CC 50 ) and haemolytic (HC 50 ) concentrations of CM-II-sPLA 2 were >10,000 ng/ml, implying that CM-II-sPLA 2 did not significantly damage the PM. These results suggest that CM-II-sPLA 2 and its derivatives are good candidates for the development of broadspectrum antiviral drugs that target viral envelope lipid bilayers derived from the ER membrane.

2|chunk|Cellular membrane compartments can be categorised into two groups; the first group consists of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), nuclear envelope, lipid droplets and cis-Golgi (ER-NE-cis-Golgi lipid territory) and the second group consists of the trans-Golgi, plasma membrane (PM) and endosomes (trans-Golgi-PM-EE membrane territory) 1-3 . The ER-NE-cis-Golgi membranes have lipid packing defects, whereas the trans-Golgi-PM-EE membranes show tight packing of phospholipids 3 . Additionally, the phospholipid contents of the ER-NE-cis-Golgi membranes differ from those of the trans-Golgi-PM-EE membranes. Enveloped viruses acquire their envelope lipid bilayers from host cellular membranes 4 . Consequently, the phospholipid contents of viruses budding through the ER-NE-cis-Golgi membranes differ from those of viruses budding through the trans-Golgi-PM-EE membranes 5-7 . Moreover, the physicochemical characteristics, such as thickness and sturdiness, differ between
