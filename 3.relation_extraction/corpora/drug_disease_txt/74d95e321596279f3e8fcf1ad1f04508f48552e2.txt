1|chunk|The revised definition of sepsis is life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection . The objective of this study was to evaluate procalcitonin (PCT) for the diagnosis and prognosis of sepsis using SEPSIS-3.

2|chunk|We enrolled 248 patients, who were admitted to the emergency department with suspected bacterial infection from June 2016 to February 2017. Definite bacterial infection was defined by proven culture results, and probable bacterial infection was based on diagnostic modalities other than culture. The sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score of 2 points or more from the baseline was diagnosed as sepsis. PCT was measured by the AFIAS-6 immunoassay system (Boditech Med Inc.) using whole blood. White blood cell (WBC), C-reactive protein (CRP), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ERS) were evaluated.

3|chunk|: The final diagnosis was sepsis in 185 patients with infection of respiratory and genitourinary tract constituted 84.6%. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was as follows: PCT, 0.682 (0.589-0.765); CRP, 0.583 (0.487-0.673); ESR, 0.540 (0.515-0.699); and WBC, 0.611 (0.455-0.633), respectively. In multivariate analysis, age, SOFA, and PCT (log scale) predicted non-survivors with an odds ratio with 95% confidence interval of 1.055 (1.008-1.105), 1.303 (1.142-1.486), and 2.004 (1.240-3.238), respectively.

4|chunk|Among sepsis group, initial PCT was increased in non-survivor (23.2 ng/dL) compared to survivor group (8.1 ng/dL) with statistical significance (P = .005).

5|chunk|Conclusions: PCT could support and predict the unfavorable prognosis of sepsis based on SEPSIS-3, whereas diagnostic potential of PCT requires further evaluations.
