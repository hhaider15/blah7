1|chunk|Surface plasmon resonance confirmed G-quadruplex specificity over linear sequences and fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis indicated that hnRNP A2/B1 is able to efficiently unfold the LTR G-quadruplexes. Evaluation of the thermal stability of the LTR G-quadruplexes in different-length oligonucleotides showed that the protein is fit to be most active in the LTR full-length environment. When hnRNP A2/B1 was silenced in cells, LTR activity decreased, indicating that the protein acts as a HIV-1 transcription activator. Our data highlight a tightly regulated control of transcription based on G-quadruplex folding/unfolding, which depends on interacting cellular proteins. These findings provide a deeper understanding of the viral transcription mechanism and may pave the way to the development of drugs effective against the integrated HIV-1, present both in actively and latently infected cells.

2|chunk|G-quadruplexes (G4s) are unique four-stranded nucleic acid structures that may form in guanine-rich sequences. Based on the strand orientation, they can adopt three main topologies: parallel, antiparallel, and hybrid-type structures. G4s have been shown to be involved in key regulatory and pathological roles in eukaryotes, including transcriptional regulation of gene promoters and enhancers, translation, chromatin epigenetic regulation, DNA recombination 1-3 . Formation of G4 in vivo has been consolidated by the development of G4 specific antibodies 4,5 .

3|chunk|Recently, the presence of G4s in viruses and their involvement in key steps of viral infection has been provided 6 . G4s have been reported in the SARS coronavirus 7 , the human papilloma, hepatitis C, Zika and Ebola virus genomes 8-11 . Among herpesviruses, RNA G4s have been implicated in the regulation of DNA replication and translation of the Epstein-Barr virus 12,13 . We have shown that the herpes simplex virus 1 possesses several repeats of sequences forming stable G4s, which were visualized in infected cells by a G4-specific antibody 14 ; stabilization of these tetraplex structures by a G4 ligand inhibited viral DNA replication 15 .

4|chunk|The largest body of evidence of G4-mediated regulation of viruses has been provided for the human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), the etiologic agent of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). We and other groups have identified functionally significant G4s in the Nef coding region 16 and in the unique long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter 17-19 of HIV-1. When the HIV-1 G4s were stabilized by G4 ligands, antiviral effects, mainly dependent on inhibition of LTR-mediated transcription, were observed 18, 20, 21 . Furthermore, the cellular protein nucleolin has been shown to stabilize the HIV-1 LTR G4s and induce potent inhibition of viral transcription 22 .

5|chunk|In general, several proteins that modulate G4s and/or serve as a bridge to recruit additional protein regulators have been reported 23 . Besides the shelterin complex proteins that are involved in telomere homeostasis 24 , G4 interacting proteins either stabilize (e.g. nucleolin, MAZ and nucleophosmin) or unfold (the helicase and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) families) 25,26 the G4 conformation to allow for a tightly controlled modulation of the epigenetic G4 switch.
