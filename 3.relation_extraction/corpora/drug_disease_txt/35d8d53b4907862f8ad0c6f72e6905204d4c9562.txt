1|chunk|Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) was recognized in U.S. swine for the first time in early 2013. A plaque-purified PED virus (PEDV) isolate (USA/Iowa/18984/2013) was obtained from a diarrheic piglet. The isolate is genetically close to other previously reported U.S. PEDVs and recent Chinese PEDVs and was virulent when inoculated into neonatal pigs.
