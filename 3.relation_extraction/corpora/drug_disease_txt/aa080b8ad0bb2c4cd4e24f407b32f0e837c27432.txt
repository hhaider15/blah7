Next, we found that ALV-J CHN06 strain infection of DF-1 cells correlated with extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2) activation, which was mainly induced within 15 min, a very early stage of infection, and at a late infection stage, from 108 h to 132 h post-infection. Infection with other ALV subgroup (A/B) strains also triggered ERK/MAPK activation. Moreover, when activating ERK2, ALV subgroups A, B and J simultaneously induced the phosphorylation of c-Jun, an AP1 family member and p38 activation but had no obvious effect on JNK activation at either 15 min or 120 h. Interestingly, only PD98059 inhibited the ALV-induced c-Jun phosphorylation while SP600125 or SB203580 had no influence on c-Jun activation. Furthermore, the viral gp85 and gag proteins were found to contribute to ERK2/AP1 activation. Additionally, the specific ERK inhibitor, PD980509, significantly suppressed ALV replication, as evidenced by extremely low levels of ALV promoter activity and ALV-J protein expression.

2|chunk|Avian leukosis viruses (ALV), an oncogenic retrovirus, mainly induce neoplastic diseases and other reproduction problems by both vertical and horizontal transmission infection. Based on the identity of viral envelope glycoproteins, ALV is divided into subgroups A, B, C, D, E, J and the recently identified subgroup K 1,2 . So far, most of isolated and identified ALV in China pertain to subgroups A, B and J inducing disease in the commercial meat and egg type chickens as well as in the Chinese local breeds 3-6 . ALV can cause significant economic losses as a result of tumor-induced mortality, serious immunosuppression and reduction of weight gain, egg production and breeding potential. Widespread ALV-J can induce various tumors in chickens, especially myeloid leukosis and hemangioma. Our previous study demonstrated that MYC, TERT, and ZIC1genes were identified as the common insertion sites in ALV-J induced myeloid leukosis, which might be a putative "driver" for the activation of the oncogene 7 . However, the cellular factors involved in exogenous ALV infection and oncogenesis, especially signal transduction pathways, are yet to be revealed.

3|chunk|Isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) is a stable isotope method for protein measurement by using mass spectrometry 8 . In the current study, we applied iTRAQ followed by liquid chromatography/ tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to compare the protein profile of DF-1 cell line with and without ALV-J infection. Based on the proteome data and Western blot confirmation, we inferred that the up-regulation of
