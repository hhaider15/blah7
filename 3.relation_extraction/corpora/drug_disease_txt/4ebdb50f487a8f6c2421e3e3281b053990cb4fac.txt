0|chunk|Full-Length Genome Sequence of Porcine Deltacoronavirus Strain USA/IA/2014/8734

1|chunk|Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) was detected in feces from diarrheic sows during an epidemic of acute and transmissible diarrhea. No transmissible gastroenteritis virus or porcine epidemic diarrhea virus was detected. The PDCoV USA/IA/2014/8734 from the herd was sequenced for full-length genomic RNA to further characterize PDCoV in U.S. swine.
