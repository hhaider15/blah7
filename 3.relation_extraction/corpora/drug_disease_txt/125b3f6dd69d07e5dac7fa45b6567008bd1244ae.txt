1|chunk|Modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) is the vector of choice for human and veterinary applications due to its strong safety profile and immunogenicity in vivo. The use of MVA and MVA-vectored vaccines against human and animal diseases must comply with regulatory requirements as they pertain to environmental risk assessment, particularly the characterization of potential adverse effects to humans, animals and the environment. MVA and recombinant MVA are widely believed to pose low or negligible risk to ecosystem health. However, key aspects of MVA biology require further research in order to provide data needed to evaluate the potential risks that may occur due to the use of MVA and MVA-vectored vaccines. The purpose of this paper is to identify knowledge gaps in the biology of MVA and recombinant MVA that are of relevance to its hazard characterization and discuss ongoing and future experiments aimed at providing data necessary to fill in the knowledge gaps. In addition, we presented arguments for the inclusion of uncertainty analysis and experimental investigation of verifiable worst-case scenarios in the environmental risk assessment of MVA and recombinant MVA. These will contribute to improved risk assessment of MVA and recombinant MVA vaccines.

Many viruses have been used as GMVs for vaccination purposes, the major ones being Poxviridae (Vaccinia virus; VACV), Retroviridae (including lentivirus), Adenoviridae (human Adenovirus; hAdV), Parvoviridae (Adeno-associated virus; AAV), Herpesviridae (cytomegalovirus; CMV) and Paramyxoviridae (sendai virus; SeV) [1, 2] . Each has unique attributes and associated risks when used as a GM virus vaccine or vector.

3|chunk|VACV-based vectors have good historical precedence on safety in that VACV and modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) were used in smallpox vaccination. VACV-based vectors were also well tolerated in clinical trials, although adverse effects were recorded in some studies at high dose (over 10 8 pfu) of MVA [3] . Disadvantages of vectors based on VACV include limited immunogenicity and pre-existing immunity [4] . Recombinant AdV vectors have the advantage of high transduction efficiency, a high level of transgene expression, broad cell tropism and the ability to infect both dividing and non-dividing cells [5] . The AdV vectors are also well tolerated but the presence of pre-existing anti-AdV immunity is a disadvantage associated with them [6] [7] [8] . Similar to AdV, AAV can infect dividing and non-dividing cells and has broad cell tropism. In addition, AAV vectors also provide long-term transgene expression, however, they may require host genome integration for viral gene expression [9] . Retrovirus and AAV vectors provide long-term gene expression and they are not plagued with pre-existing immunity. However, their package size is limited to 4.5 and 7.5 kilobases respectively [10] and retroviruses are associated with various diseases, e.g., leukemia, lymphoma and AIDS [11, 12] . Vectors derived from SeV show high efficiency in gene transfer and transduce both dividing and non-dividing cells [13] . SeV infects human epithelial cells efficiently and can therefore be administered intranasally. This reduces the influence of pre-existing immunity compared to intramuscular administration [13] . These advantages/benefits of the various GMVs are being exploited in improving virus-based GM vaccines, while efforts are underway to reduce their limitations.
