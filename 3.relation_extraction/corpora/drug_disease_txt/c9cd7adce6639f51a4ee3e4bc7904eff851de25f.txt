1|chunk|Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a cause of diarrhea outbreaks at swine farms, causing vomiting, severe diarrhea, and mortality in piglets. We sequenced and analyzed the complete genome of recently isolated strains. Tottori2/JPN/2014, one of the sequenced PEDV strains, had a unique large deletion in the S gene.
