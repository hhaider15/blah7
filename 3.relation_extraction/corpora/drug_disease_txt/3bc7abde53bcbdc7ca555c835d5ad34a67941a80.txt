1|chunk|Eukaryotic translation elongation factors 1 alpha, eEF1A1 and eEF1A2, are not only translation factors but also pleiotropic proteins that are highly expressed in human tumors, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and lung cancer. eEF1A1 modulates cytoskeleton, exhibits chaperone-like activity and also controls cell proliferation and cell death. In contrast, eEF1A2 protein favors oncogenesis as shown by the fact that overexpression of eEF1A2 leads to cellular transformation and gives rise to tumors in nude mice. The eEF1A2 protein stimulates the phospholipid signaling and activates the Akt-dependent cell migration and actin remodeling that ultimately favors tumorigenesis. In contrast, inactivation of eEF1A proteins leads to immunodeficiency, neural and muscular defects, and favors apoptosis. Finally, eEF1A proteins interact with several viral proteins resulting in enhanced viral replication, decreased apoptosis, and increased cellular transformation. This review summarizes the recent findings on eEF1A proteins indicating that eEF1A proteins play a critical role in numerous human diseases through enhancement of oncogenesis, blockade of apoptosis, and increased viral pathogenesis.

2|chunk|The amino acids sequences of each protein were submitted to SWISS-MODEL server to build a 3D model (10).The highest resolved structure, 1.67- X-ray-derived eEF1A protein structure from yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) with PDB ID: 1f60 and E -value 0.0 (sequence identity: 80.371%) was used as a template for modeling. Structurally, each model consists of three domains, domain I, domain II, and domain III as shown in the above cartoon. Domain I (residues 1-240) is made up of Rossmann-fold topology. Domain II (residues 241-336) and domain III (residues 337-443) are made up of entirely from beta-strands; each domain contains two beta sheets that form a beta barrel (7).
