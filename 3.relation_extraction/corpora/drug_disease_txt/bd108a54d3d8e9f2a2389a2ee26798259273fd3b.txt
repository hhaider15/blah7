1|chunk|We read with great interest the article by Khan et al. [1] reporting the results of a pilot clinical trial of administrating recombinant angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Current research has been focused on the involvement of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in the pathogenesis and clinical outcomes of ARDS and, in particular, in the evaluation of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)/ angiotensin II (Ang II)/Ang II receptor type 1 axis and its counterpart ACE2/angiotensin-(1-7)/MAS1 receptor pathway as potential therapeutic targets. Given the lack of effective pharmacological ARDS treatments, clinical trials exploring new therapeutic strategies, like that by Khan et al.

3|chunk|The association of ACE activity with ARDS outcomes is far from linear. Multiple factors, like the heterogeneity of ARDS and the variability of RAS activation in patient subgroups, could be implicated in this complex interplay [1]. Even though increased levels of ACE and Ang II have been detected in patients with ARDS, the pathophysiological role of RAS in ARDS development remains unclear. Additional factors such as, for example, the variable substrates of ACE and ACE2 apart from Ang (namely bradykinin and apelin), the protective effects against lung injury which Ang II receptor type 2 exerts, and the effect
