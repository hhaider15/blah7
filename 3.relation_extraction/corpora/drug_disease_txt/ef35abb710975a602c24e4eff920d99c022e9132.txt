1|chunk|The flavonoid-rich extract from Paulownia fortunei flowers (EPF) has been reported to prevent obesity and other lipid metabolism disease. However, the mechanism of its protective effects is not yet clear. The objective of this study was to investigate molecular factors involved in the hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic effects of EPF in obese mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD). Male h ICR (Institute of Cancer Research) mice were fed a HFD containing or not containing the EPF (50 or 100 mg/kg) for eight weeks. EPF reduced body weight gain, lipid accumulation in livers and levels of lipid, glucose and insulin in plasma as well as reduced insulin resistance as compared with the HFD group. EPF significantly decreased serum aminotransferase activity of the HFD group. We observed that EPF administration significantly increased the level of AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation and prevented fat deposits in livers and HepG2 cells, but these effects were blocked by compound C (an AMPK inhibitor). The protective effects of EPF were probably associated with the decrease in HMGCR, SREBP-1c and FAS expressions and the increase in CPT1 and phosphor-IRS-1 expressions. Our results suggest that EPF might be a potential natural candidate for the treatment and/or prevention of overweight and hepatic and metabolic-related alterations induced by HFD.

2|chunk|Indigenous medicinal plants have been recommended for treatment of many metabolism diseases because of their easy availability and relatively fewer side effects [1, 3, 5] . Epidemiological studies revealed that an increased daily intake of phenolic compounds in dietary supplements act as anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory agents to increase thermogenesis and energy expenditure while decreasing inflammation and oxidative stress, further supporting progress towards decreased metabolic disorders [1, 5] . Previous studies confirmed that the species of the genus Paulownia (belonging to the family scrophulariaceae) exhibited a broad spectrum of biological effects, including antioxidant, anticarcinogenic [6, 7] , antiphlogistic [8], antiviral [9], antimicrobial [10] and anti-cholinesterase activities [11] . Paulownia fortunei (Seem.) Hemsl. is a fast growing ornamental tree, native to Mainland China and distributed almost all over the world [10] . This species is renowned as a polyphenol rich plant, which has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of hypertension, enteritis, tonsillitis, bronchitis and dysentery [7, 12, 13] . The flowers of P. fortunei are also used as an additive to seasonal foods in China, made into a local delicacy called "Zheng Cai". Previous studies have shown that flower extracts of P. fortunei (EPF) contain high amounts of flavonoids, which are mainly composed of apigenin, luteolin, hesperetin, -sitosterol, thunberginol A, daucosterol, quercetin, kaempferol, and their derivatives [12,13]. In previous study, we showed that flavonoid puerarin could prevent hyperlipidemia, oxidative stress and other lipid metabolism disorder disease in livers [14, 15] . For these reasons, we hypothesized that the extract from P. fortunei flowers (EPF) might play an important role in protecting HFD-induced hyperlipidemia, insulin resistance and hepatic fat accumulation. In this study, for the first time, we used high-fat diet induced obese mice to verify the protective effects of ethanol extract of P. fortunei flowers containing the flavonoids and to study the mechanisms focusing on these effects in enhancing AMPK signaling pathway and inhibiting lipid metabolism disorder in livers.
