1|chunk|poorly understood. In this study, we used ex vivo invasion assays and population genetic analyses to investigate the involvement of complement receptor 1 (CR1) in P. vivax invasion. First, we observed that P. vivax invasion of reticulocytes was consistently reduced when CR1 surface expression was reduced through enzymatic cleavage, in the presence of naturally low-CR1-expressing cells compared with high-CR1-expressing cells, and with the addition of soluble CR1, a known inhibitor of P. falciparum invasion. Immuno-precipitation experiments with P. vivax Reticulocyte Binding Proteins showed no evidence of complex formation. In addition, analysis of CR1 genetic data for worldwide human populations with different exposure to malaria parasites show significantly higher frequency of CR1 alleles associated with low receptor expression on the surface of RBCs and higher linkage disequilibrium in human populations exposed to P. vivax malaria compared with unexposed populations. These results are consistent with a positive selection of low-CR1-expressing alleles in vivax-endemic areas. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that CR1 availability on the surface of RBCs modulates P. vivax

2|chunk|Plasmodium vivax is the most widespread human malaria parasite outside sub-Saharan Africa, with 2.5 billion people at risk of infection and tens of millions of cases every year 1 . During the asexual cycle, parasites in the human blood invade, grow, and multiply inside young red blood cells (RBCs), bursting at the schizont stage and releasing merozoites into the blood circulation to invade new reticulocytes. RBC invasion is a complex, multi-step process that involves merozoite attachment, apical reorientation, tight junction formation, and host cell invagination and penetration. In addition, it requires the orchestration of multiple ligand-receptor interactions throughout the different steps of the process 2 . While many of the parasite-host interactions engaged in invasion have been characterized through well-established culture techniques and advanced genetic technologies for Plasmodium falciparum 2,3 , research on P. vivax invasion mechanisms continues to lag behind owing to the lack of a reliable long-term in vitro culture system dependent on a continuous source of reticulocytes 4,5 . A deeper understanding of the mechanisms involved in the process of P. vivax invasion is essential for designing meaningful strategies to prevent P. vivax infections. However, the only well-characterized, essential ligand-receptor interaction that has been identified to date is that between the Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines (DARC) on RBCs and P. vivax Duffy binding protein (PvDBP) 6 . P. vivax infections are rare in sub-Saharan African populations, where a silencing mutation in the Duffy blood group is present at near fixation levels 7 . However, recent reports of P. vivax infections in Duffy-negative individuals 8 , together with recently described receptor-ligand interactions 9-11 and potential parasite ligands to unknown receptors 12 , paint a much more complex scenario with multiple host-parasite interactions yet to be well characterized.

3|chunk|During reticulocyte maturation, the RBC membrane goes through intense remodeling of its surface in a process that results in a significant reduction and loss of receptors such as complement receptor 1 (CR1, CD35). CR1 is a type 1 transmembrane protein whose expression is reduced 3.5-fold during reticulocyte maturation 13 . It has an immune-regulatory role in complement activation and removes C3b-and C4b-containing immune complexes from the blood circulation 14 . It is also a known receptor for P. falciparum invasion through binding with the PfRh4 parasite ligand 15,16 and for rosetting through interaction with the parasite's erythrocyte membrane protein-1 (PfEMP-1) 17 . CR1 protein levels on the surface of RBCs are genetically determined by low (L) and high (H) expression alleles that result in the production of high (HH), medium (HL), or low (LL) levels of CR1. Two CR1 SNPs SNPs are under linkage disequilibrium (LD) in both Caucasians and Africans 23 . An association between low CR1 expression and protection against severe P. falciparum malaria has been reported in some epidemiological studies 19,24-26 but not in others 21,27 , illustrating a complex relationship between CR1 and susceptibility to P. falciparum infection and disease. To the best of our knowledge, the involvement of CR1 in P. vivax invasion has not yet been investigated.

4|chunk|We hypothesize that CR1 on the surface of reticulocytes is involved in P. vivax invasion and that polymorphisms in the CR1 gene associated with low CR1 expression have been positively selected in P. vivax-exposed populations because of their protective effect, i.e., their ability to decrease the efficiency of P. vivax invasion. To explore this hypothesis, we performed ex vivo invasion assays under different experimental conditions and investigated signals of positive selection in the CR1 gene using SNP data from worldwide populations.
