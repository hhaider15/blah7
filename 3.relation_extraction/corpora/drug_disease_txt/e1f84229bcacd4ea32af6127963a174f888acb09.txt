1|chunk|domain proteins are ubiquitously present from prokaryotes to human and in many positive-strand RNA viruses, playing important roles in multiple cellular processes. Towards understanding the function of the HEV macro domain, we characterized its interaction partners among other HEV encoded proteins. Here, we report that the HEV X-domain directly interacts with the viral methyltransferase and the ORF3 proteins. ORF3 association with the X-domain was mediated through two independent motifs, located within its N-terminal 35aa (amino acids) and C-terminal 63-123aa. Methyltransferase interaction domain was mapped to N-terminal 30-90aa. The X-domain interacted with both ORF3 and methyltransferase through its C-terminal region, involving 66 th ,67 th isoleucine and 101 st ,102 nd leucine, conserved across HEV genotypes. Furthermore, ORF3 and methyltransferase competed with each other for associating with the X-domain. These findings provide molecular understanding of the interaction between the HEV macro domain, methyltransferase and ORF3, suggesting an important role of the macro domain in the life cycle of HEV.

2|chunk|Hepatitis E virus (HEV) causes acute viral hepatitis, which is a major public health concern in developing and resource poor countries 1 . The disease is mostly self-limiting but chronic infection has been reported in immune-compromised patients 2,3 . Moreover, HEV infection significantly increases the mortality rate (~30%) in pregnant women 4 . The virus is zoonotic and transmitted predominantly through the feco-oral route (contaminated food and water), blood and vertical transfusion 5 .

3|chunk|HEV is the only member classified as a Hepevirus in the family of Hepeviridae. It is a positive-sense, single strand, nonenveloped RNA virus with a 7.2 kb genome. It consists of a 5 -noncoding region (NCR) of 27 to 35 nucleotides, followed by three known open reading frames: ORF1, ORF2 and ORF3 and a 3 -NCR of 65 to 74 nucleotides, ending with a poly (A) tail of variable length 1 . The 5 end has m7G cap 6 . The ORF1 encodes the nonstructural proteins: methyltransferase (Met), papain-like cysteine protease (PCP), helicase and RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). It also codes for domains of unknown functions such as X, Y, V and DUF3729 domain 7 . HEV methyltransferase is able to catalyze the transfer of methyl group from S-adenosyl methionine to GTP, to yield m7GTP and also forms a covalent complex with m7GMP, indicating an associated guanylyltransferase activity 8, 9 . PCP has been reported to deubiquitinate interferon-stimulated gene-15 AMC (ubiquitin-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin) 8 . HEV helicase is a nucleoside triphosphatase with the ability to unwind RNA duplexes in the 5 to 3 direction 10,11 . Viral RdRp has been shown to be essential for viral replication 12,13 . ORF2 is an N-linked glycoprotein, which forms the viral capsid 14 . ORF2 glycosylation has been demonstrated to be important for the formation of infectious virus particles 15 . ORF2 binds to the 5 -region of HEV genomic RNA 16 . It has been shown to induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and exploit the ER-associated degradation pathway to gain access to the cytoplasm where it inhibits the host NF B activity 17, 18 . The ORF3 is a small phosphoprotein situated between ORF1 and ORF2, overlapping ORF2. It binds to several host proteins and modulates their activity 19 . Importantly, it binds to the tumor susceptibility gene101 (TSG101) and mediates the release of the progeny virus 20,21 .

4|chunk|Among the domains of unknown function, the X-domain is designated as a macro domain, owing to its homology with the macro domain of the histone H2A2 22 . Macro domains are conserved protein domains, widely distributed across bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. Human genome contains nine genes encoding the macro domain proteins 23 : two histones macroH2A1 and macroH2A2 are involved in genome silencing and regulation of gene expression 24 ; Snf2-like helicase (ALC1), a protein involved in chromatin remodeling; three proteins belonging to the B-aggressive lymphoma (BAL) family of transcription factors 25, 26 ; and the function of the other three, MDO1 (LRP16), MDO2 and MDO3 (GDAP2) is poorly understood.

5|chunk|The macro domains are also present in many positive strand RNA viruses such as the SARS CoV (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV), the Sindbis virus and the Rubella virus, where it is referred as the X-domain 27 . The X-domain of the SARS-CoV and HEV has been shown to efficiently bind free and poly ADP-ribose polymerase-1 bound poly ADP-ribose in vitro. However, they have relatively poor ADP-ribose 1 -phosphohydrolase activity 27 . When overexpressed in HEK293T cells, the HEV X-domain inhibits poly (I:C) induced phosphorylation of the interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3), which is the key transcription factor for interferon induction 28 . Mutational studies have indicated a role of the X-domain in viral replication 22, 29 . However, the exact function of the X-domain in the life cycle of HEV remains to be explored.

6|chunk|This study was initiated to understand the role of the X-domain during the life cycle of HEV. We have identified the interaction partners of the X-domain among the HEV encoded proteins and demonstrate that the X-domain directly and selectively associates with the viral methyltransferase and the ORF3 proteins. Further investigations were carried out to map the interaction domain, evaluate the specificity and establish whether the interaction partners competed or cooperated with each other to form a multi protein complex. Significance of these interactions during the life cycle of HEV is discussed.
