1|chunk|Internet-based participatory surveillance systems, such as the German GrippeWeb, monitor the frequency of acute respiratory illnesses on population level.

2|chunk|In order to interpret syndromic information better, we devised a microbiological feasibility study (GrippeWeb-Plus) to test whether self-collection of anterior nasal swabs is operationally possible, acceptable for participants and can yield valid data.

3|chunk|We recruited 103 GrippeWeb participants (73 adults and 30 children) and provided them with a kit, instructions and a questionnaire for each sample. In the first half of 2016, participants took an anterior nasal swab and sent it to the Robert Koch Institute whenever an acute respiratory illness occurred. Reporting of illnesses through the GrippeWeb platform continued as usual. We analysed swabs for the presence of human c-myc-DNA and 22 viral and bacterial pathogens. After the study, we sent participants an evaluation questionnaire. We analysed timeliness, completeness, acceptability and validity.
