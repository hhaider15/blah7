1|chunk|Recent studies have shown that gamma interferon (IFN-) synergizes with the innate IFNs (IFN- and IFN-) to inhibit herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) replication in vitro. To determine whether this phenomenon is shared by other herpesviruses, we investigated the effects of IFNs on human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) replication.

2|chunk|We have found that as with HSV-1, IFN- synergizes with the innate IFNs (IFN-/) to potently inhibit HCMV replication in vitro. While pre-treatment of human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs) with IFN-, IFN- or IFN- alone inhibited HCMV plaque formation by ~30 to 40-fold, treatment with IFN- and IFN- or IFN- and IFN- inhibited HCMV plaque formation by 163-and 662-fold, respectively. The generation of isobole plots verified that the observed inhibition of HCMV plaque formation and replication in HFFs by IFN-/ and IFN- was a synergistic interaction. Additionally, real-time PCR analyses of the HCMV immediate early (IE) genes (IE1 and IE2) revealed that IE mRNA expression was profoundly decreased in cells stimulated with IFN-/ and IFN- (~5-11-fold) as compared to vehicle-treated cells. Furthermore, decreased IE mRNA expression was accompanied by a decrease in IE protein expression, as demonstrated by western blotting and immunofluorescence.

3|chunk|Conclusion: These findings suggest that IFN-/ and IFN- synergistically inhibit HCMV replication through a mechanism that may involve the regulation of IE gene expression. We hypothesize that IFN- produced by activated cells of the adaptive immune response may potentially synergize with endogenous type I IFNs to inhibit HCMV dissemination in vivo.
