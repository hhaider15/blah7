1|chunk|PLOS Pathogens | membranous web (MW) containing viral replication and assembly complexes. The MW is thought to function in concentrating viral components, regulating virus replication, and immune evasion. Our analysis has provided new insight into the organization of the MW and the mechanisms that contribute to the formation and maintenance of distinct compartments within the MW. We show that the MW limits access of host cell innate immune receptors to sites of viral replication and assembly. Moreover, we show that components of the nuclear transport machinery, normally involved in regulating traffic between the cytoplasm and the nucleus, have a role in limiting immune receptor access to compartments within the MW. These findings provide important insights in how HCV, and likely other positive-strand RNA viruses, organize their replication factories and evaded recognition by host cell immune receptors.
