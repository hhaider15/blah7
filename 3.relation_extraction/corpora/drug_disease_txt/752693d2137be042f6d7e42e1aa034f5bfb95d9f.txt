1|chunk|Chemical synthesis. Treatment of 1 [1] with trifluoroacetic acid followed by coupling with Boc-L-Val-L-Phg-OH (2) mediated by HATU afforded I2 with 83% yield (Scheme 1). Next, the Boc protecting group in I2 was removed, and liberated amine was coupled with 5-metylisoxale-3carboxylic acid (3) to produce I4 with 96% yield. Following similar procedures, the other six compounds in Table 2 were prepared.
