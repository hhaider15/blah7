1|chunk|MHV-A59 (NC_001846) viral particles were collected from infected Neuro-2a cell line as described (Cui et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2015) . The cell culture was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 30 min at 4C to remove the cell debris and the supernatant was collected and centrifuged again at 32,000 rpm for 2 h at 4C to pellet the virus. The precipitant was resuspended with 1 ml Tris-NaCl buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl at pH 8.0 and 100 mM NaCl). The resuspended virus (1 ml) was loaded onto a 10%~60% (w/v) step sucrose gradient (total 9.6 ml, 1.6 mL/layer) and centrifuged at 22,000 rpm for 20 h at 4 C. Viral particles were collected from the interface between 20% and 30% sucrose layers. The collection was diluted with the Tris-NaCl buffer.

2|chunk|The virus was pelleted by centrifugation at 35,000 rpm for 2 h at 4C and was then resuspended with 100 l Tris-NaCl buffer. The purified MHV viral particles were stored at 4C.

3|chunk|The MHV particles were lysed by incubating the sample in a buffer containing ~3% CHAPS (Sigma-aldrich co. llc usa), 20 mM HEPES-Na at pH 7.6 and 150 mM NaCl for 30 min at 4 degree. The lysate was then loaded on a 20% sucrose cushion prepared in a buffer containing 20mM HEPES-Na at pH 7.6 and 150 mM NaCl (HEPES buffer). The RNPs were pelleted by centrifugation for 30 min at 21,130  g. To remove the sucrose, the pallet was washed twice with the HEPES buffer by
