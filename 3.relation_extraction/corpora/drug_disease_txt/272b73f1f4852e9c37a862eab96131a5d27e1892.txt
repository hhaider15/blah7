1|chunk|Visual observation and standard hematoxylin and eosin staining were performed to detect pathological damage in the liver, and viral copy numbers and cytokine expression in the liver were evaluated by quantitative PCR. The CH strain (10 8.4 copies/mg) had higher viral titers than the CH60 strain (10 4.9 copies/mg) in the liver and caused ecchymotic hemorrhaging on the liver surface. Additionally, livers from ducklings inoculated with the CH strain were significantly infiltrated by numerous red blood cells, accompanied by severe cytokine storms, but similar signs were not observed in the livers of ducklings inoculated with the CH60 strain. In conclusion, the severe cytokine storm caused by the CH strain apparently induces hemorrhagic lesions in the liver, which might be a key factor in the rapid death of ducklings.

2|chunk|Duck hepatitis A virus type 1 (genus Avihepatovirus, family Picornaviridae, DHAV-1) is one of the most common and lethal pathogens in young ducklings and is responsible for acute hepatitis, characterized by petechial and ecchymotic hemorrhages of the liver surface 1,2 . The liver, a major site for the regulation of immune and inflammatory responses, plays a critical role in defending against invasive pathogens 3,4 . Immune responses in the liver appear to have evolved to balance virus eradication and immunopathology 5 . Major hepatotropic viruses, such as hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV), interact with innate immunity factors and induce both interferons (IFNs, types I and III) and antiviral IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), and these viruses have developed multiple strategies to escape innate immune responses 6-10 . Inflammation is a double-edged sword that plays a vital role in liver metabolism. Moderate inflammatory responses confer a certain degree of protection, help repair damaged tissue, and promote steady-state reconstruction. However, uncontrolled inflammatory responses are present in most clinical cases of liver disease and may form a "storm" that causes liver damage, fibrosis, cirrhosis and other adverse consequences 11-13 .

3|chunk|Infection of adult ducks with DHAV-1 was previously shown to result in transient cytokine storms in their kidneys 14 . However, only one study has investigated virus-host interactions in the livers of DHAV-1-infected ducklings. Therefore, in this study, we established an experimental model utilizing the virulent CH DHAV-1 strain and the attenuated CH60 commercial vaccine strain to investigate DHAV-1 pathogenicity and host immune responses in 7-day-old ducklings.
