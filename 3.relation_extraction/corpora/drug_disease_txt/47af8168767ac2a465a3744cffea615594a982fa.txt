0|chunk|ethical and Philosophical considerations for Gain-of-Function Policy: the importance of Alternate experiments The Department of Health and Human Services Framework for Guiding Funding Decisions about Proposed Research Involving Enhanced Potential Pandemic Pathogens

1|chunk|PPPs) contains a series of principles for governing the funding and conduct of gain-offunction (GOF) research resulting in the creation of PPPs. In this article, I address one of these principles, governing the replacement of GOF research with alternate experiments. I argue that the principle fails to address the way that different experiments can promote the same values as those promoted by GOF research resulting in PPPs. I then address some objections to this claim, and provide policy recommendations moving forward.
