1|chunk|Most of studies have focused on molecular and pathogenic characterization of PEDV, whereas there were limited studies in understanding the role of gut microbiota (GM) in viral-associated diarrhea. Here, using the Illumina MiSeq platform, we examined and compared the impact of PEDV infection on the GM of sows and their piglets less than 10 days old. Our results showed that PEDV caused alternations in the structure and abundance of GM from levels of phylum to genus, and even species. For sows, a significant decrease of observed species was found in diarrheal sows than that in healthy sows (p < 0.05). The unweighted and weighted UniFrac distances also revealed considerable segregations of GM structure among healthy, asymptomatic, and diarrheal sows. For piglets, Bacteroidetes, the dominant bacteria in healthy piglets, were replaced by Firmicutes in asymptomatic and diarrheal piglets. The abundances of Fusobacteria and Proteobacteria were also remarkably increased in asymptomatic piglets and diarrheal piglets when compared to those of the healthy piglets. Our findings demonstrated that PEDV infection caused severe perturbations of GM, reduced probiotic bacteria, and enriched pathogenic bacteria.

2|chunk|Since 2010, the global swine industry has experienced outbreaks of severe diarrhea caused by variant porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) 1-3 . The variant PEDV caused severe diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, and high morbidity and mortality in newborn piglets as well as sporadic diarrhea in sows and finishing pigs in China in 2010. Afterwards, the outbreaks have been reported in Europe 4 , America 5,6 , and other Asian countries 7,8 . Pigs suffered from diarrheal syndromes were unresponsive to antibiotics treatment and common management practices, and were even not protected from prior immunization with attenuated and/or inactivated CV777-based PEDV vaccines 9,10 .

3|chunk|Most of previous studies were mainly focused on the characterization of PEDV, virus isolation, pathology, and molecular evolution. However, there were only limited studies about the effects of the mucosal microflora residents on health and their roles during PEDV infection. The mammalian gut is a complex ecological niche, containing bacteria, eukaryotes, viruses, and even archaeon 11 . It has been demonstrated that colonized gut microbiota (GM) are important for the health and development of animals via aiding colonic fermentation 12 , stimulating the immune system 13 , defensing pathogens 14 , and improving energy harvest 15 . Studies on humans unraveled that diarrhea 16 and bowel inflammation 17 would distort GM in normal gut. In pigs, a few studies that examined the GM of healthy pigs under different growth stages or breeds demonstrated Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes are predominant phyla regardless of ages and breeds, while dynamic changes in percentage of GM at both phylum and genus levels were observed under different growth stages and conditions including age, weaning and colitis [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . Remarkable alternations of fecal microbiota were reported in neonatal piglets with diarrhea (NNPD) of unknown etiology 26, 27 . It was reported genus Enterococcus was 24 times and phylum Fusobacteria was doubled in abundance in diarrheal piglets compared to that of the healthy piglets.
