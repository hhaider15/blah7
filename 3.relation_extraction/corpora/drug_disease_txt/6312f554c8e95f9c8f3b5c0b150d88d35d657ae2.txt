1|chunk|Background Human enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) recently caused an increase in mild-to-severe pediatric respiratory cases in North America and some European countries. Even though few of these children presented with acute paralytic disease, direct causal relationship cannot yet be assumed.

2|chunk|Objectives The purposes of this report were to describe the clinical findings of an outbreak of EV-D68 infection in Mexico City and identify the genetic relationship with previously reported strains.

3|chunk|Patients/Methods Between September and December 2014, 126 nasopharyngeal samples (NPS) of hospitalized children <15 years of age with ARI were tested for the presence of respiratory viruses using a multiplex RT-qPCR and EV-D68-specific RT-qPCR. Clinical, epidemiological, and demographic data were collected and associated with symptomatology and viral infections. Phylogenetic analyses were performed using VP1 region.

4|chunk|Results Enterovirus/rhinovirus infection was detected in 40 patients (317%), of which 24 patients were EV-D68-positive. EV-D68 infection prevailed over September and October 2014 and was associated with neutrophilia and lymphopenia, and patients were more likely to develop hypoxemia. Phylogenetic analyses showed that Mexican EV-D68 belongs to the new B1 clade.

5|chunk|Conclusions This is the first EV-D68 outbreak described in Mexico and occurred few weeks after the United States reported similar infections. Although EV-D68 belongs to new B1 clade, no neurological affection was observed.
