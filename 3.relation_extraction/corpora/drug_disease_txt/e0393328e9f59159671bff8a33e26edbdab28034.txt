1|chunk|Sustained adaptive immunity to pathogens provides effective protection against infections, and effector cells located at the site of infection ensure rapid response to the challenge. Both are essential for the success of vaccine development. To explore new vaccination approach against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) infection, we have shown that Rv3615c, identified as ESX-1 substrate protein C of M.tb but not expressed in BCG, induced a dominant Th1-type response of CD4 + T cells from patients with tuberculosis pleurisy, which suggests a potential candidate for vaccine development. But subcutaneous immunization with Rv3615c induced modest T-cell responses systemically, and showed suboptimal protection against virulent M.tb challenge at the site of infection. Here, we use a mouse model to demonstrate that intranasal immunization with Rv3615c induces sustained capability of adaptive CD4 + T-and B-cell responses in lung parenchyma and airway. Rv3615c contains a dominant epitope of mouse CD4 + T cells, Rv3615c 41-50 , and elicits CD4 + T-cell

Since T cells resident at mucosal tissue are potent at control of infection at early stage, our data show that intranasal immunization with Rv3615c promotes a sustained regional immunity to M.tb, and suggests a potency in control of M.tb infection. Our study warranties a further investigation of Rv3615c as a candidate for development of effective vaccination against M.tb infection.
