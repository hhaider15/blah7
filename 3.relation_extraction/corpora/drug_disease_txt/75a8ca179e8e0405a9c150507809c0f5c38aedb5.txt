1|chunk|To develop an effective vaccine that does not enhance RSV illness, it is important to understand how formalin and heat inactivation affected the antigenicity and immunogenicity of FI-RSV compared to native virus. Informed by atomic structures of RSV fusion (F) glycoprotein in prefusion (pre-F) and postfusion (post-F) conformations, we demonstrate that FI-RSV predominately presents post-F on the virion surface, whereas infectious RSV presents both pre-F and post-F conformations. This significant antigenic distinction has not been previously appreciated. Thus, a stabilized pre-F antigen is more representative of live RSV than F in its post-F conformation, as displayed on the surface of FI-RSV. This finding has major implications for discriminating current pre-F-based immunogens from FI-RSV used in historical vaccine trials.

2|chunk|Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is an enveloped, non-segmented negative-sense, single-stranded RNA virus that causes upper and lower respiratory tract infections. Nearly everyone is infected with the virus in the first two years of life; while reinfections occur throughout life, disease severity is highest in infants and the elderly. RSV represents a serious health and economic burden, and is the leading cause of hospitalization in children under the age of 5 (ref. 1).

3|chunk|Despite RSV being discovered nearly 60 years ago, no licensed vaccine is yet available. In part, this delayed development stems from clinical trials using formalin-inactivated RSV (FI-RSV) product that caused an enhanced respiratory disease (ERD) syndrome in children who received the FI-RSV vaccine. The FI-RSV vaccine adjuvanted with alum was evaluated in four separate studies in seronegative infants and young children in 1966 (refs 2-6). Instead of eliciting protective immunity, a greater number of vaccinees developed severe illness compared to control groups. A three dose regimen (0, 1, 4 months) was used in subjects between 2 and 7 months of age, 16 were hospitalized of the 20 infected children in the FI-RSV-vaccinated group (N = 31) compared to only 1 hospitalized of 21 infected in the control groups (N = 40) 3 . Tragically, two of the FI-RSV recipients died at 14 and 16 months of age from bacterial pneumonia complicating their subsequent RSV infection. In the majority of vaccinees, priming with FI-RSV led to pathology upon subsequent RSV infection that ordinarily is only manifest in a small fraction of RSV-nave individuals. The immunological basis for FI-RSV-induced enhanced illness has focused on two major features of the humoral and cellular responses. First, FI-RSV induced high titers of binding antibody with weak neutralizing and fusion-inhibitory activity 7,8 . These antibodies in the context of large antigen load led to immune complex deposition and complement activation in airways upon subsequent RSV infection 9 . Second, natural RSV infection after immunization with FI-RSV was associated with exaggerated peribronchiolar inflammation and infiltration of neutrophils and eosinophils into airways. This is consistent with findings in animal models where FI-RSV has been shown to induce Th2-biased immune responses and airway hypersensitivity characterized by up regulation of IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, and IgE 10 .
