1|chunk|Single-stranded RNA viruses of both positive and negative polarity have been used as vectors for vaccine development. In this context, alphaviruses, flaviviruses, measles virus and rhabdoviruses have been engineered for expression of surface protein genes and antigens. Administration of replicon RNA vectors has resulted in strong immune responses and generation of neutralizing antibodies in various animal models. Immunization of mice, chicken, pigs and primates with virus-like particles, naked RNA or layered DNA/RNA plasmids has provided protection against challenges with lethal doses of infectious agents and administered tumor cells. Both prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy has been achieved in cancer immunotherapy. Moreover, recombinant particles and replicon RNAs have been encapsulated by liposomes to improve delivery and targeting. Replicon RNA vectors have also been subjected to clinical trials. Overall, immunization with self-replicating RNA viruses provides high transient expression levels of antigens resulting in generation of neutralizing antibody responses and protection against lethal challenges under safe conditions.

Finally, a summary of clinical trials already conducted or in progress that apply self-replicating RNA viruses is presented. However, due to the large number of publications available, it is only possible to present key findings and examples of vaccine development for self-replicating viral vectors.

3|chunk|Expression systems have been engineered for RNA viruses as described below. All ssRNA viruses share the feature of high level of RNA replication in the cytoplasm, which provides the basis for extreme transient expression of heterologous genes. However, the different polarities of the ssRNA genomes of self-replicating RNA viruses have required the design of vectors with specific features. Moreover, the viral vectors can be utilized in different forms as indicated for the individual types of viruses below.

4|chunk|Alphavirus-based expression systems have been developed in different formats for SFV [14] , SIN [15] and VEE [16], here illustrated for SFV (Figure 1 ). In all cases, the basic component is represented by the alphavirus non-structural genes (nsP1-4), responsible for rapid and high quantity cytoplasmic RNA replication [17] . The replication-deficient system carries the gene of interest (GoI) downstream of the nsP1-4 genes in the alphavirus expression vector to be driven by the 26S subgenomic promoter. RNA replicon vectors can be generated by in vitro transcription for direct RNA immunization. In case of production of recombinant particles, in vitro transcribed RNA from an alphavirus helper vector is co-transfected or co-electroporated into baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells. The replication-proficient system utilizes a full-length vector, where the GoI can be introduced either downstream of the nsP1-4 genes or the structural genes. In vitro transcribed RNA can be applied for immunization, but due to the presence of full-length alphavirus genomic RNA, replication-proficient particles are generated. The DNA layered system applies plasmids carrying alternatively the nonstructural genes or the full-length genome and the GoI for direct immunization with DNA. All vector system approaches described above have proven efficient in immunization studies as presented below [4].

5|chunk|Among flaviviruses, Kunjin virus [18], West Nile virus [19,20], yellow fever virus [21,22], dengue virus [23,24] and tick-borne encephalitis virus [25, 26] have been engineered for the development of vectors for DNA, RNA and recombinant particle delivery. In Kunjin virus vectors, the GoI is inserted between the first 20 codons of the core protein (C20) and the last 22 codons of the envelope gene (E22) in frame with the rest of the viral polyprotein (Figure 2) [27]. The GoI is expressed initially as a fusion with the Kunjin virus polyprotein, which is then processed into individual proteins. Introduction of flanking FMDV-2A protease sequences allows the cleavage of Kunjin virus sequences from the expressed recombinant protein [28] . To facilitate vector production, a system has been engineered for transfection of Kunjin virus replicon RNA into the tetKUNCprMEC packaging cell line.

Reverse genetics has allowed the rescue of recombinant measles virus in an HEK293 helper cell line, where foreign genes were introduced between the phosphoprotein (P) and the matrix protein (M) or between the hemagglutinin (H) and the large protein (L), respectively, in the measles virus genome [30] .
