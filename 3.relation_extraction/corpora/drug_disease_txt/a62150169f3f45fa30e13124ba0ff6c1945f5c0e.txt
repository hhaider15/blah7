1|chunk|Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection constitutes a significant health burden worldwide, because it is a major etiologic agent of chronic liver disease, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. HCV replication cycle is closely tied to lipid metabolism and infection by this virus causes profound changes in host lipid homeostasis. We focused our attention on a phosphatidate phosphate (PAP) enzyme family (the lipin family), which mediate the conversion of phosphatidate to diacylglycerol in the cytoplasm, playing a key role in triglyceride biosynthesis and in phospholipid homeostasis. Lipins may also translocate to the nucleus to act as transcriptional regulators of genes involved in lipid metabolism. The best-characterized member of this family is lipin1, which cooperates with lipin2 to maintain glycerophospholipid homeostasis in the liver. Lipin1-deficient cell lines were generated by RNAi to study the role of this protein in different steps of HCV replication cycle. Using surrogate models that recapitulate different aspects of HCV infection, we concluded that lipin1 is rate limiting for the generation of functional replicase complexes, in a step downstream primary translation that leads to early HCV RNA replication. Infection studies in lipin1-deficient cells overexpressing wild type or phosphatase-defective lipin1 proteins suggest that lipin1 phosphatase activity is required to support HCV infection. Finally, ultrastructural and biochemical analyses in replication-independent models suggest that lipin1 may facilitate the generation of the membranous compartment that contains functional HCV replicase complexes.

2|chunk|Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is an important biomedical problem worldwide because it causes severe liver disease and cancer. Although immunological events are major players in HCV pathogenesis, interference with host cell metabolism contribute to HCV-associated pathologies. HCV utilizes resources of the cellular lipid metabolism to strongly modify subcellular compartments, using them as platforms for replication and infectious particle assembly. In particular, HCV induces the formation of a "membranous web" that hosts the viral machinery dedicated to the production of new copies of the viral genome. This lipid-rich structure provides an optimized platform for viral genome replication and hides new viral genomes from hosts antiviral surveillance. In this study, we have identified a cellular protein, lipin1, involved in the production of a subset of cellular lipids, as a rate-limiting factor for HCV infection. Our results indicate that the enzymatic activity of lipin1 is required to build the membranous compartment dedicated to viral genome replication. Lipin1 is probably contributing to the formation of the viral replication machinery by locally providing certain lipids required for an optimal membranous environment. Based on these results, interfering with lipin1 capacity to modify lipids may therefore constitute a potential strategy to limit HCV infection.

4|chunk|One of the salient manifestations of HCV interference with lipid metabolism at the cellular level is the formation of a distinctive membranous web in HCV-replicating cells [14] . Within this structure, HCV RNA replication is thought to occur in double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) that emerge from the endoplasmic reticulum [15] [16] [17] . HCV replicase formation requires not only viral replicase components NS3 through NS5B [16] , but also recruitment and subversion of different key cellular factors that cooperate to provide an optimal membrane microenvironment for the assembly of HCV replicase complexes [11] . In this sense, HCV replicase complexes are located in characteristic detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs) that cofractionate with caveolin-2 [18-20] and the sigma-1 receptor (SIGMAR1) [21] . These endoplasmic reticulum (ER) microdomains containing the viral replicase are enriched in cholesterol, probably by the direct involvement of cellular proteins involved in non-vesicular cholesterol transport [11] .

5|chunk|Assembly of progeny virions is thought to occur at the interphase between ER and lipid droplets (LD) [12] and HCV virion assembly and secretion processes are strongly dependent on host factors involved in biogenesis of triacylglycerol (TAG)-rich lipoproteins [22][23][24][25]. Thus, HCV infection requires de novo biosynthesis of phospholipids, like phosphatidylcholine (PC), in order to generate its membranous RNA replicase compartments [26] and TAG biosynthesis to ensure progeny virion production [12] . This, together with the fact that PC and TAG biosynthesis are altered by HCV infection [26][27][28], suggests an important role for glycerophospholipid metabolism in HCV infection.

6|chunk|Lipins are key players in glycerophospholipid metabolism, as they catalyze phosphate removal from phosphatidic acid (PA) to produce diacylglycerol (DAG), which is a precursor of TAG, but also a precursor for PC and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) biosynthesis in mammalian cells [29]. Lipins may also translocate to the nucleus to directly interact with promoter DNA-binding transcription factors to stimulate or repress transcription of lipogenic genes [30][31][32]. Two conserved motifs are required for phosphatidic acid phosphatase (PAP) catalytic activity (DXDXT) and transcriptional regulation (LXXIL) respectively [31]. Substrate specificity is restricted to PA, a characteristic that, together with the lack of integral membrane domains and the dependence on Mg 2+ for catalytic activity, differentiates lipins from other mammalian PAP [33].

7|chunk|Lipin1, the best-characterized member of the family, was discovered as a consequence of the genetic analysis of a mouse strain displaying fatty liver dystrophy phenotype (fld mice) [34, 35]. Interestingly, lipin1 deletion in the liver of fld mice, results in accumulation of lipin2 protein, a second member of the family predominantly expressed in the liver, which maintains normal cellular PAP activity and compensates some, but not all, aspects of glycerolipid metabolism [36]. Conversely, LPIN2 knock-out mice display increased lipin1 protein expression, as compared with wild type (wt) littermates, suggesting a similar homeostatic compensatory mechanism to maintain liver PAP activity [37]. Thus, lipin1 and lipin2 coordinate lipid homeostasis in the liver [37]. While individual LPIN1 or LPIN2 deletions are tolerated in mice, double knockout mice are embryonically lethal [37]. Despite this apparent functional redundancy, lipin1 is emerging as a key player in ethanol-induced steatosis [38] and a single nucleotide polymorphism in LPIN1 is associated with the severity of liver damage and fibrosis progression in pediatric human patients with histological non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [39] , suggesting that liver lipin1 dysfunction may contribute to steatosis-related liver pathogenesis.
