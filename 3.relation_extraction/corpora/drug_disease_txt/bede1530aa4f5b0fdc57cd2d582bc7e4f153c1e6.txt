1|chunk|Epidemics can spread across large regions becoming pandemics by flowing along transportation and social networks. Two network attributes, transitivity (when a node is connected to two other nodes that are also directly connected between them) and centrality (the number and intensity of connections with the other nodes in the network), are widely associated with the dynamics of transmission of pathogens. Here we investigate how network centrality and transitivity influence vulnerability to diseases of human populations by examining one of the most devastating pandemic in human history, the fourteenth century plague pandemic called Black Death. We found that, after controlling for the city spatial location and the disease arrival time, cities with higher values of both centrality and transitivity were more severely affected by the plague. A simulation study indicates that this association was due to central cities with high transitivity undergo more exogenous re-infections. Our study provides an easy method to identify hotspots in epidemic networks. Focusing our effort in those vulnerable nodes may save time and resources by improving our ability of controlling deadly epidemics.

2|chunk|Most important pandemics in human history, such as cholera, plague, influenza, HIV/AIDS, malaria, or severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), have propagated across large territories following transportation, commercial and travelling networks 1-3 . Pathogen invasion of distant areas through air transportation networks is promoting the appearance of emerging infectious diseases in new, formerly disease-free territories, such as malaria in Brazil 4 and dengue in North America 5 . The transmission dynamics of infectious diseases have been investigated extensively using complex network theory in which nodes represent species, populations, individuals, etc., which are connected through sexual, social, or commercial contacts 3,6 .

3|chunk|Two topological and structural properties of networks mediate the spreading dynamics of diseases 3,7-22 : transitivity (the propensity of nodes of clustering together 9,11,12 ) and centrality (the number and intensity of connections with other nodes 3). Diseases spread more efficiently in highly transitive networks 3,13-15 . In contrast, factors decreasing transitivity, such as the existence of structural holes that disconnect neighboring nodes, hinders the traffic throughout the network 3 . Nodes displaying high transitivity, because are located in denser regions of the network, can be reached multiple times by disease through different routes of transmission 21, 22 . The occurrence of reinfections highly increases the virulence of the pathogens and the mortality rate of the hosts 23,24 . On the other hand, central nodes are more important sources of diseases than peripheral nodes, both in sexual, contact and ecological networks 3, 6, 9, [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . They also become infected earlier, while isolated nodes become infected later or even avoid infection 13 . This suggests that nodes bearing high values of centrality and transitivity in epidemic networks will be more vulnerable and will undergo more mortality than peripheral nodes.

4|chunk|In this study we investigate how network centrality and transitivity influence vulnerability to diseases of human populations by examining one of the most devastating pandemic in human history, the fourteenth century plague pandemic called Black Death. This epidemic ravaged Europe between 1346 and 1353, killing between 30% and 50% of its population 2 . The causative agent and etiology of the medieval Black Death are still debated.
