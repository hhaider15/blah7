1|chunk|As intracellular parasites, viruses require a host cell in order to replicate. However, they face a series of cellular responses against infection. One of these responses is the activation of the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-activated protein kinase R (PKR). PKR phosphorylates the  subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2), which in turn results in global protein synthesis inhibition and formation of stress granules (SGs). Recent studies have shown that SGs can interfere with the replicative cycle of certain viruses. This review addresses how viruses have evolved different control strategies at the SG level to ensure an efficient replication cycle during the cellular stress response triggered by the viral infection.
