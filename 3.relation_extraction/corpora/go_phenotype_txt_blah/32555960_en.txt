1|chunk|To investigate the use of "ultra-early" postoperative feeding (oral liquid diet offered in the post-anesthetic recovery room) in patients undergoing common general surgical procedures and to assess the volume of intravenous fluids, as well as the rate of complications and the length of hospital stay.Prospective, observational study, which assessed the compliance with the "ultra-early" feeding, the reduction of preoperative fasting time, the perioperative venous hydration volume, the length of stay and the operative morbidity.154 patients with a mean age of 46  15 years were followed. "Ultra-early" feeding was performed in 144 cases (93.5%). Patients who did not receive the "ultra-early" feeding received a significantly greater volume of postoperative intravenous fluids (500mL versus 200mL, p = 0.018). The length of stay was 2.4  2.79 days (conventional feeding) versus 1.45  1.83 days ("ultra-early" feeding), with no statistical difference (p = 0.133). There was no difference in the percentage of general complications (p = 0.291), vomiting (p = 0.696) or surgical infection (p = 0.534)."Ultra-early" feeding had a high adherence by patients undergoing common general surgical procedures, and it was related to decreased infusion of postoperative fluids. Complication rates and the length of stay were similar between groups.
