1|chunk|To reclassify deaths of women infected with the human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome in pregnancy and childbirth in the State of Pernambuco, Brazil, from 2000 to 2010.A descriptive exploratory study, developed from the following steps: translation to Portuguese of the item "HIV and aids" of the United Nations document "The WHO application of ICD-10 to deaths during pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium: DCI MM 2012"; development of a classification algorithm of deaths of women living with the human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome in pregnancy and childbirth; and reclassification of deaths by a group of experts.Among the 25 reclassified deaths, 12 were due to human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and pregnancy condition was coexisting; 9 were reclassified as indirect maternal death, with O98.7 code, proposed by the World Health Organization; 2 as direct/indirect maternal death; and 2 were considered indeterminate.The reclassification showed a possible pattern of change in maternal mortality, since most of the deaths were attributed to the virus and may lead to a reduction in deaths from maternal causes. The algorithm will subsidize the use of the new classification of maternal death and human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
