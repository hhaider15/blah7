The surface of the groove, covered with numerous conserved residues between the head and body domains of influenza A NP, plays a crucial role in RNA binding. To explore the mechanism by which NP binds RNA, we performed a series of sitedirected mutagenesis in the RNA-binding groove, followed by surface plasmon resonance (SPR), to characterize the interactions between RNA and NP. Furthermore, a role of Y148 in NP stability and NP-RNA binding was evaluated. The aromatic residue of Y148 was found to stack with a nucleotide base. By interrupting the stacking interaction between Y148 and an RNA base, we identified an influenza virus NP inhibitor, (E, E)-1,7-bis(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl) -1,6-heptadiene-3,5-dione; this inhibitor reduced the NP's RNA-binding affinity and hindered viral replication. Our findings will be useful for the development of new drugs that disrupt the interaction between RNA and viral NP in the influenza virus.">

The sudden swine-origin influenza virus H1N1v pandemic outbreak in 2009 caused 18,000 deaths 1,2 . The viral surface proteins hemagglutinin and neuraminidase have played important roles in antiviral drug discoveries and provide crucial neutralization against the virus 3 . Tamiflu (oseltamivir), which is a neuraminidase inhibitor, is used to treat flu infection 4-7 . However, several H1N1 influenza strains are resistant to Tamiflu because they contain the H274Y mutation in neuraminidase. Thus, new anti-influenza drugs are urgently needed."/>

NP encapsulates the viral genome for RNA transcription, replication, virus packaging, and intracellular trafficking, and it also functions as a key adapter molecule between viral and host cell processes 9 . NP has been shown to cooperatively interact with RNA. In addition, NP interacts with a wide variety of viral and cellular macromolecules, including two subunits of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, viral matrix, actin, components of the nuclear import/export apparatus, and a nuclear RNA helicase 10 . According to protein sequence alignment, the 498-aa NP is highly conserved among influenza viruses. The multifunctional capabilities of NP in the viral life cycle makes this protein an attractive target for drug development 11,12 .">
