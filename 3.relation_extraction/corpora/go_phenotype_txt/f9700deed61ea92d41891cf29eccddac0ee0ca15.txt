1|chunk|Chronic renal failure (CRF) is a major public health problem worldwide. Hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) plays important roles in renal physiological and pathophysiological processes. However, whether H 2 S could protect against CRF in rats remains unclear. In this study, we found that H 2 S alleviated gentamicininduced nephrotoxicity by reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated apoptosis in normal rat kidney-52E cells. We demonstrated that H 2 S significantly improved the kidney structure and function of CRF rats. We found that H 2 S decreased the protein levels of Bax, Caspase-3, and Cleaved-caspase-3, but increased the expression of Bcl-2. Treatment with H 2 S reduced the levels of malondialdehyde and ROS and increased the activities of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase. H 2 S significantly abolished the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and p38 in the kidney of CRF rats. Furthermore, H 2 S decreased the expression levels of tumor necrosis factor-, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, as well as the protein levels of p50, p65, and p-p65 in the kidney of CRF rats. In conclusion, H 2 S could ameliorate adenine-induced CRF in rats by inhibiting apoptosis and inflammation through ROS/mitogen-activated protein kinase and nuclear factor-kappa B signaling pathways.

2|chunk|As the incidence of chronic renal failure (CRF) increases at an alarming rate, CRF has been considered a major public health problem worldwide 1 . CRF is a syndrome characterized by progressive and irreversible deterioration of renal function 2 . In humans, CRF is mainly caused by hypertension, glomerulonephritis, and diabetes mellitus 3, 4 . This condition is made worse by a deterioration in nutrition level caused by accumulation of uremic toxins and reduced food intake, which could be attributed to many factors, such as gastrointestinal congestion, loss of appetite, and reduced glomerular filtration rate 4-6 . Compared to patients with other chronic diseases, patients with CRF tend to require longer and more frequent hospitalizations which are associated with higher morbidity and mortality 7 . Therefore, it is urgent to develop alternative medicines and novel therapies for the treatment of CRF.

3|chunk|Hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) has recently been identified as the third endogenous gaseous transmitter that is enzymatically synthesized by cystathionine -lyase (CSE), cystathionine -synthase (CBS), and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3-MST) in mammalian tissues 8, 9 . These enzymes have been identified in the kidney and are responsible for endogenous renal H 2 S production 10-12 . An increasing number of studies indicate that H 2 S plays an important role in renal physiology and pathology 11, 13, 14 . The physiological level of H 2 S leads to vasodilation and increases glomerular filtration rate and renal blood flow, which causes an indirect increase of the urinary excretion of K + and Na + 13 . Under pathological conditions, H 2 S exerts the protective role in a number of experimental models of renal disease, including obstructive nephropathy 11 , renal ischemia-reperfusion injury 15 , and Published: xx xx xxxx OPEN www.nature.com/scientificreports/ 2 Scientific RepoRts | 7: 455 | diabetic nephropathy 16 . Recent studies demonstrated that H 2 S is significantly lower in plasma and tissues of uremic patients and 5/6 nephrectomy rats [17] [18] [19] . Considering the beneficial effects of H 2 S in renal physiology and pathology, we hypothesize that the application of exogenous H 2 S may effectively protect against CRF.

4|chunk|Gentamicin (GEN), an aminoglycoside antibiotic, plays an important role in the treatment of a wide range of gram-negative bacterial infections. However, nephrotoxicity is considered as its major side effect, which seriously limits its clinical use 20, 21 . GEN has been widely used in in vitro models through inducing nephrotoxicity, such as normal rat kidney (NRK)-52E cells [20] [21] [22] . In this study, we investigated the effects of H 2 S on the nephrotoxicity induced by GEN in NRK-52E cells. The adenine-induced CRF model in rats is a standard method for inducing metabolic abnormalities closely resembling those observed in uremic patients 23, 24 . Therefore, a rat model of adenine-induced CRF was used in the present study. We also investigated the effects and mechanisms of H 2 S on adenine-induced CRF in rats.

(Shanghai, China) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)/F12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 g/ml streptomycin, and 100 U/ml penicillin. Cells were cultured in a humidified incubator with 5% CO 2 and 95% air at 37 C. Confluent NRK-52E cells were transferred to serum-free DMEM/F12 medium for overnight starvation before each experiment. NRK-52E cells were incubated with 3 mM GEN for 24 h to induce nephrotoxicity 25 . The cells were divided into three groups: Control group, GEN group, and GEN+H 2 S group. The control and GEN groups were treated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and the GEN+H 2 S group was treated with 100 M NaHS (an H 2 S donor, dissolved in PBS). Treatments with PBS and NaHS were concomitant to GEN-induced nephrotoxicity for 24 h.

6|chunk|For 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation assay, the proliferating cells were examined using the Cell-Light EdU Apollo 567 In Vitro Imaging Kit (RiboBio, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China). Briefly, after incubation with 10 mM EdU for 2 h, NRK-52E cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 and stained with the fluorescent dyes. 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (5 mg/ml) was used to stain the cell nuclei for 10 min at room temperature. Then the cells were visualized under a fluorescent microscope (Eclipse Ti, Nikon, Melville, NY, USA) from five random fields. Cell proliferation rate = (EdU-positive cells)/(total number of cells)  100%. Cell growth was also measured using the CellTiter 96 AQ ueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay kit (MTS; Promega, Madison, WI, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocols.

Cells were incubated with 10 M DCF-DA for 30 min at 37 C and washed three times with PBS. The fluorescence was observed by a fluorescent microscope (Eclipse Ti, Nikon, Melville, NY, USA) from five random fields and measured by ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). Cellular apoptosis analysis. Cellular apoptosis was analyzed by performing a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay using an in situ cell death detection kit (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, Shanghai, China) following the manufacturer's instructions. After 4% paraformaldehyde fixation and 0.1% Triton X-100 permeabilization, cells were incubated with 50 l TUNEL reaction mixture for 60 min at 37 C in the dark and then rinsed with PBS three times. Then after a 10 min DAPI (5 mg/ml) counterstain at room temperature, cells were photographed with a fluorescent microscope (Eclipse Ti, Nikon, Melville, NY, USA) from five random fields. The apoptotic index = (positively stained apoptotic cells)/(total number of cells)  100%.
