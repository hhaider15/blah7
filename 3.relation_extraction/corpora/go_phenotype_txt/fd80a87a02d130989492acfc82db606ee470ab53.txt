1|chunk|Flaviviruses accumulate abundant subgenomic RNA (sfRNA) in infected cells. It has been reported that sfRNA results from stalling of host 5'-to-3' exoribonuclease XRN1 at the highly structured RNA of the 3' untranslated region (UTR). Although XRN1 digestion of a 3'-terminal 800-nt RNA could stall at a position to generate the sfRNA in vitro, we found that knocking out XRN1 had no effect on the accumulation of sfRNA in Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infected cells. Mutagenesis studies revealed that the stemloop II (SLII) at the 3' UTR is required for the accumulation of sfRNA. According to the results of an in vitro RNAdependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) assay, the (-)10431-10566 RNA fragment, containing the putative promoter on the antigenome for the sfRNA transcription, binds to RdRp protein and exhibits a strong promoter activity. Taken together, our results indicate that the JEV sfRNA could be transcribed initially and then be trimmed by XRN1 or other unidentified exoribonucleases.
