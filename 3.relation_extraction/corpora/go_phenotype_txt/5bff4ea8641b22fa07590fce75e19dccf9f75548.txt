2|chunk|A total of 25 calves with diarrhea as experimental group and 10 healthy calves as control group, 1-30 days old, were enrolled in the study. Blood samples were collected from jugular vein in tubes with anticoagulant agent to evaluate the concentration of triglycerides, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), ALP, total and direct bilirubin. Very low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (VLDL-C) and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels were calculated according to the Friedewald formula.

3|chunk|Results: Significant increases in the plasma levels of ALP (p<0.05), total and direct bilirubin, triglycerides, and VLDL-C (p<0.01) were determined, whereas significant decreases in the levels of total cholesterol, HDL-C and LDL-C (p<0.01) were observed in neonatal calves with diarrhea.

4|chunk|According to the findings of this study, liver functions impaired and, therefore, lipid profile is affected negatively in neonatal calves with diarrhea.
