1|chunk|Pre-weaning diarrhea (PWD) in mink kits is a common multifactorial syndrome on commercial mink farms. Several potential pathogens such as astroviruses, caliciviruses, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus delphini have been studied, but the etiology of the syndrome seems complex. In pooled samples from 38 diarrheic and 42 non-diarrheic litters, each comprising of intestinal contents from 2-3 mink kits from the same litter, the bacterial populations were studied using Illumina Next Generation Sequencing technology and targeted 16S amplicon sequencing. In addition, we used deep sequencing to determine and compare the viral intestinal content in 31 healthy non-diarrheic and 30 diarrheic pooled samples (2-3 mink kits from the same litter per pool). The results showed high variations in composition of the bacterial species between the pools. Enterococci, staphylococci and streptococci dominated in both diarrheic and non-diarrheic pools. However, enterococci accounted for 70% of the reads in the diarrheic group compared to 50% in the non-diarrheic group and this increase was at the expense of staphylococci and streptococci which together accounted for 45% and 17% of the reads in the non-diarrheic and diarrheic group, respectively. Moreover, in the diarrheic pools there were more reads assigned to Clostridia, Escherichia-Shigella and Enterobacter compared to the non-diarrheic pools. The taxonomically categorized sequences from the virome showed that the most prevalent viruses in all pools were caliciviruses and mamastroviruses (almost exclusively type 10). However, the numbers of reads assigned to caliciviruses were almost 3 times higher in the diarrheic pools compared the non-diarrheic pools and Sapporo-like caliciviruses were more abundant than the Norwalklike caliciviruses. The results from this study have contributed to the insight into the changes in the intestinal microbiota associated with the PWD syndrome of mink.
