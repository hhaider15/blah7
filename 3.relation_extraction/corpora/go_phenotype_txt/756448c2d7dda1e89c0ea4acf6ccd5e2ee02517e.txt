0|chunk|viruses The Interplay of Viral and Host Factors in Chikungunya Virus Infection: Targets for Antiviral Strategies

1|chunk|Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) has re-emerged as one of the many medically important arboviruses that have spread rampantly across the world in the past decade. Infected patients come down with acute fever and rashes, and a portion of them suffer from both acute and chronic arthralgia. Currently, there are no targeted therapeutics against this debilitating virus. One approach to develop potential therapeutics is by understanding the viral-host interactions. However, to date, there has been limited research undertaken in this area. In this review, we attempt to briefly describe and update the functions of the different CHIKV proteins and their respective interacting host partners. In addition, we also survey the literature for other reported host factors and pathways involved during CHIKV infection. There is a pressing need for an in-depth understanding of the interaction between the host environment and CHIKV in order to generate potential therapeutics.

2|chunk|During that outbreak, one-third of the 785,000 residents of La Runion were infected with CHIKV, with a 0.1% fatality rate [14, 15] . This ever-expanding geographical range of CHIKV infection seemed unstoppable [16, 17] . In 2007, autochthonous CHIKV cases were reported in Italy, making the first instance of an outbreak in temperate regions [18] . Outbreaks and other autochthonous transmission events were subsequently reported in many non-endemic regions like Singapore from 2006 to 2015; France (West-French indies, Caribbean islands) from 2013 CHIKV-infected patients experience a sudden onset of fever of about 40  C, together with the trademark symptoms of intense muscle pain in the arms, calves, and thighs, as well as arthralgia in the ankles, elbows, knees, and wrists within 2 to 12 days of infection [25] . This is due to CHIKV's ability to infect both the skeletal muscle progenitor cells and fibroblasts in the connective tissues of muscles and joints, where a high density of nociceptive nerve endings reside [26] [27] [28] . In addition, patients also suffer from maculopapular rash, nausea, vomiting, headaches, lymphopenia, and moderate thrombocytopenia [29, 30] . The more severe cases, though rare, involve the manifestation of neurological complications. In addition, there are a few cases of CHIKV causing miscarriages and neonatal complications like neonatal encephalopathy after maternal-to-fetal transmission [31] [32] [33] [34] . The immunopathogenesis of CHIKV infection has been extensively reviewed by Burt and colleagues [35] .

3|chunk|These acute symptoms usually resolve within two weeks. However, a significant portion of patients experience persistent and/or recurrent joint pains for months or years after contracting CHIKV [36, 37] . The mechanism of the progression of the CHIKV disease to the chronic phase remains poorly characterized. However, recent studies have shown that macrophages may play a role in the chronic manifestations of CHIKV [38, 39] .

4|chunk|Despite the significant healthcare threat posed by the CHIKV, there are still no available vaccines or therapeutics for CHIKV infections [1, 35] . Patients are usually given analgesics and anti-inflammatory drugs to relieve symptoms. Even though there are a number of anti-CHIKV compounds being reported, precise mechanistic data of these compounds, as well as efficacy studies in mouse models, are lacking. Ribavirin and chloroquine are the only two drugs that have been tested in clinical trials [40] . Despite having promising in vitro data, chloroquine was found to be ineffective in clinical trials [41, 42] . On the other hand, Ribavirin was found to be effective in alleviating chronic symptoms. However, the clinical trial cohort (20 patients) was too small to provide conclusive evidence [43] . Therefore, there is a pressing need to identify and develop novel antivirals to combat CHIKV infection.

5|chunk|Although attempts to develop drugs that specifically target viral proteins have proven to be successful, the process is rather time-consuming and costly [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] . Furthermore, these compounds were found to often display narrow spectrum activities [49] . One promising approach is to target host factors that are known to be hijacked by viruses using either new compounds or to repurpose existing approved drugs [50] [51] [52] . However, there are still many gaps in the current knowledge of basic virology and replication of CHIKV, which poses difficulties for the discovery of anti-CHIKV therapeutics. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the existing research thus far on the interplay of viral and host factors during CHIKV infection. We hope this will guide further research into potential druggable targets in the discovery of potential therapeutics.

6|chunk|CHIKV is an enveloped, spherical virus with a diameter of about 60-70 nm [53] [54] [55] . The CHIKV genome consists of a single-stranded, positive-sense, linear RNA that is about 11,800 nucleotides long [56, 57] . The 5 end of the positive-sense RNA genome possesses a 7-methylguanosine cap, and the 3 end has a polyadenylated tail [58] . There are two open reading frames (ORF) found in the CHIKV genome, one for the non-structural proteins, the other for the structural proteins. The first ORF encoding the non-structural proteins (nsP1, 2, 3, and 4) makes up nearly two-thirds of the genome [56] . The remaining one-third portion encodes for the five structural proteins (capsid, E3, E2, Viruses 2018, 10, 294 3 of 32 6K, and E1) [56] . The CHIKV genome contains three non-translated regions (NTR) [56, 58] . The 5 NTR consists of 76 nucleotides, while the 3 NTR is composed of 526 nucleotides [59] . The remaining NTR, which is 68 nucleotides long, is found between the two ORF and carries a promoter sequence that allows the generation of the 26S subgenomic RNA that encodes all the structural proteins [59] . The CHIKV genome is enclosed within the nucleocapsid core in the mature virion. The nucleocapsid, made up of 240 units of capsid proteins [56] , is in turn surrounded by an envelope made up of a host-derived lipid bilayer. The CHIKV envelope is studded with 80 sets of trimeric spikes, with each spike containing three E1-E2 heterodimers, which mediate entry into host cells [60, 61] .

7|chunk|Upon binding to the host cell receptor via E2 protein, the CHIKV particle is endocytosed by the host cell via the clathrin-mediated pathway in a process involving Eps15 (epidermal growth factor receptor pathway substrate 15), although clathrin-independent entry has also been reported [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] . Within the early acidic endosome, the low pH environment initiates the fusion of the viral envelope and the endosomal membrane in a process mediated by the E1 protein [63, [65] [66] [67] [68] . The membrane fusion process occurs rapidly (within 40 s after endocytosed) in Ras-related protein 5 (Rab5)-positive endosomes and is found to be highly dependent on the presence of cholesterol [66] . Thereafter, the virus disassembles releasing the viral RNA genome into the cytosol [68, 69] . By hijacking the host translational machinery, the first two-thirds of the viral RNA is rapidly translated into a polyprotein (P1234), which consists of all the four non-structural proteins [53, 56] . However, this polyprotein (P1234) makes up to only 10% of all the translated transcripts due to the presence of an opal stop codon between the nsP3 and nsP4 gene [58] . The remaining 90% is made up of the P123 polyprotein. The opal stop codon is believed to play a role in regulating the levels of the nsP4 by the alphaviruses [70] . P1234 is subsequently cleaved in cis by the viral protease nsP2 yielding P123 and nsP4 [53] . This allows the formation of an initial but unstable replication complex, which allows the synthesis of negative-sense strand viral RNA. At this phase of the replication cycle, structures known as spherules, which are derived from the plasma membranes, can be observed to be studded along the plasma membrane. The unstable P123-nsP4 complexes are proposed to be localized near the neck of these spherules, which functions in protecting the double stranded RNA intermediates from detection and degradation [71] [72] [73] .

8|chunk|As the infection progresses, the spherules become internalized and contribute to the formation of a membranous structure called virus-induced type 1 cytopathic vacuoles (CPV-I) [72] [73] [74] . A recent study by Thaa and colleagues showed that most of the spherules induced by CHIKV infection remain at the plasma membrane, and that the internalization of the spherules is dependent upon the activation of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase-Akt-mTOR pathway [75] . The CPV is a typical membranous structure (derived from both endosomes and lysosomes) found in Alphavirus-infected cells that allows active synthesis of both the negative-sense RNA intermediate and the positive-sense viral RNA [72] [73] [74] . The accumulation of the P123-nsP4 complexes eventually crosses a certain stoichiometric threshold concentration leading to the cleavage of P123 in trans, releasing nsP1 protein [76, 77] . This results in a more stable replication complex within CPV-I, made up of nsP1, P23, and nsP4 [78] [79] [80] . A stable replication complex is subsequently formed upon the final cleavage of P23 into nsP2 and nsP3 proteins. This induces a switch from the synthesis of the negative-sense RNA intermediate to the synthesis of both the full-length viral genome and the 26S subgenomic RNA [74, 81] .

9|chunk|The 26S subgenomic RNA (which encodes only the structural proteins) is then translated into structural polyproteins [56] . Once the full length capsid protein has been translated, it undergoes autocleavage almost immediately, while the translation of the remaining structural proteins continues [57, [82] [83] [84] . In addition, upon its self-cleavage, the capsid protein is able to recognize the full-length genomic viral RNA [82] [83] [84] . The capsid proteins then oligomerize, packaging the viral genome into the nucleocapsid core [85, 86] . Again, similar to the non-structural proteins, two types of structural polyprotein products can be identified after the self-cleavage of the capsid protein. The presence of the major structural polyprotein (consisting of E3, E2, 6K, and E1) and the minor one (10-18%) (containing only E3, E2, and TF) have been attributed to the slippery codon
