1|chunk|Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) causes Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) 1 . To a lesser extent, KSHV is etiologically associated with rare neoplastic disorders like primary effusion lymphoma (PEL), and multicentric Castleman disease (MCD) 2 . KS is a malignant vascular tumor characterized by lesions occurring mainly on the skin, but can also affect the mucosa and visceral organs 3 . Hallmarks of KS are angiogenesis, cell proliferation, and inflammation 4 . KSHV is among the list of viral pathogens estimated to cause 12-25% of human cancers worldwide 5 .

2|chunk|KSHV has a biphasic life cycle comprised of latent and lytic phases of replication that are distinguished based on divergent gene expression profiles 6 . The dynamics between latent and lytic phases of replication allows the virus to persist for the duration of the host's lifetime 7 . Notably, KSHV establishes latency in the majority of infected cells 8 ; at any given instance, only a subpopulation (<3%) of infected cells display evidence of lytic gene expression 9 . MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are one of the main classes of non-coding RNAs 10 . These are small non-coding RNAs that regulate expression of genes in cells 11 . The human genome encodes thousands of miR-NAs 12 . Of late, miRNAs have emerged as a pivotal component of host cell responses to a pathogen including viruses, bacteria, and fungi 13 .

3|chunk|KSHV, human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) are few examples of the limited number of viruses that encode their own miRNAs 14,15 . KSHV encodes 12 pre-miRNAs which are processed to yield 25 mature miRNAs 16 . The roles of these KSHV-encoded miRNAs is to establish and/or maintain KSHV latency, enhance angiogenesis, spread infected cells, and interfere with the host immune system; all of which are crucial to oncogenesis 17 . Extensive work has been conducted on KSHV encoded miRNAs and the manner by which KSHV replication alters cellular miRNAs 18, 19 . However, there is limited work along the lines of understanding the effects of cellular miRNAs in response to early stages of KSHV infection of cells; specifically internalization of the virus. Recently, we employed deep sequencing for the first time, to analyze the miRNA expression profile in KSHV-infected BJAB cells during early stages of infection 20 . In this study, we attempted to decipher how the cellular miRNA-36 (miR-36) alters KSHV infection in physiologically relevant
