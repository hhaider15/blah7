0|chunk|A 2D graphical representation of the sequences of DNA based on triplets and its application

1|chunk|In this paper, we first present a new concept of 'weight' for 64 triplets and define a different weight for each kind of triplet. Then, we give a novel 2D graphical representation for DNA sequences, which can transform a DNA sequence into a plot set to facilitate quantitative comparisons of DNA sequences. Thereafter, associating with a newly designed measure of similarity, we introduce a novel approach to make similarities/dissimilarities analysis of DNA sequences. Finally, the applications in similarities/dissimilarities analysis of the complete coding sequences of -globin genes of 11 species illustrate the utilities of our newly proposed method.
