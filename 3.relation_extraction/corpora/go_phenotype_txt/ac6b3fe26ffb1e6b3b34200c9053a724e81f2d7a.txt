1|chunk|De novo pyrimidine biosynthesis is a key metabolic pathway involved in multiple biosynthetic processes. Here, we identified an original series of 3-(1H-indol-3-yl)-2,3-dihydro-4H-furo[3,2-c]chromen-4-one derivatives as a new class of pyrimidine biosynthesis inhibitors formed by two edge-fused polycyclic moieties. We show that identified compounds exhibit broad-spectrum antiviral activity and immunostimulatory properties, in line with recent reports linking de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis with innate defense mechanisms against viruses. Most importantly, we establish that pyrimidine deprivation can amplify the production of both type I and type III interferons by cells stimulated with retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-I) ligands. Altogether, our results further expand the current panel of pyrimidine biosynthesis inhibitors and illustrate how the production of antiviral interferons is tightly coupled to this metabolic pathway. Functional and structural similarities between this new chemical series and dicoumarol, which was reported before to inhibit pyrimidine biosynthesis at the dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) step, are discussed. KEYWORDS antiviral agents, innate immunity, interferons, pyrimidine metabolism P yrimidine nucleosides, which include uridine, cytidine, and thymidine, are paramount precursors for DNA and RNA synthesis. They also play a pivotal role as intermediates in the synthesis of membrane glycerophospholipids, glycosylated proteins, and glycogen. UDP and triphosphate are also well-known extracellular mediators that signal through P2Y membrane receptors. Altogether, this makes pyrimidine nucleosides essential to cellular metabolism. Cells rely on three sources to fulfill their needs in pyrimidines. First, the so-called "salvage pathway" recycles pyrimidine nucleobases and nucleosides produced by the degradation of RNA and DNA molecules. In addition, cells often express passive and active transmembrane transporters that enable the uptake of pyrimidines, and in particular uridine, from extracellular body fluids (1). Finally, the de novo biosynthesis pathway, which allows the production of pyrimidines from glutamine, aspartate, and bicarbonate, is essential for proliferating cells to meet their large demand for nucleotide precursors (2). On the contrary, the salvage pathway combined to pyrimidine absorption from the extracellular pool is usually sufficient to satisfy the needs of nondividing cells. A multifunctional protein called CAD catalyzes the initial steps of de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis by physically linking three enzymes: the carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase (CPSase), the aspartate transcarbamylase (ATCase), and the dihydroorotase (DHOase).
