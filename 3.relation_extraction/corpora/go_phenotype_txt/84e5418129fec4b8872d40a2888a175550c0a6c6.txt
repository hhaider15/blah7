1|chunk|All ESI-MS experiments were performed on a micrOTOF-Q mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) equipped with standard ESI source. The instrument was operated in the positive-ion mode and calibrated with the Tunemix mixture (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA). The scan range was between 200 -1700 m/z. The mass accuracy was better than 5 ppm. Samples were dissolved in 200 L of the water/MeCN/HCOOH (50:50:0.1, v/v/v) mixture. Analyte solution was infused at a flow rate of 3 l/min. The instrument parameters were as follows: scan range: 50-1600 m/z; drying gas: nitrogen; flow rate: 4.0 L/min, temperature: 200 C; potential between the spray needle and the orifice: 4.2 kV.

2|chunk|The doubly charged precursor ion was selected on the quadrupole and subsequently fragmented in the hexapole collision cell. Argon was used as a collision gas. The obtained fragments were registered as an MS/MS (tandem mass spectrometry) spectrum. The collision voltage (10-26 V) was optimized for the best fragmentation. For MS spectra analysis, a Bruker Compass DataAnalysis 4.0 software was used.
