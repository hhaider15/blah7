0|chunk|Phylogenetic evidence of a novel lineage of canine pneumovirus and a naturally recombinant strain isolated from dogs with respiratory illness in Thailand

1|chunk|Background: Canine pneumovirus (CPV) is a pathogen that causes respiratory disease in dogs, and recent outbreaks in shelters in America and Europe have been reported. However, based on published data and documents, the identification of CPV and its variant in clinically symptomatic individual dogs in Thailand through Asia is limited. Therefore, the aims of this study were to determine the emergence of CPV and to consequently establish the genetic characterization and phylogenetic analysis of the CPV strains from 209 dogs showing respiratory distress in Thailand.

2|chunk|Results: This study identified and described the full-length CPV genome from three strains, designated herein as CPV_ CP13 TH/2015, CPV_CP82 TH/2016 and CPV_SR1 TH/2016, that were isolated from six dogs out of 209 dogs (2.9%) with respiratory illness in Thailand. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that these three Thai CPV strains (CPV TH strains) belong to the CPV subgroup A and form a novel lineage; proposed as the Asian prototype. Specific mutations in the deduced amino acids of these CPV TH strains were found in the G/glycoprotein sequence, suggesting potential substitution sites for subtype classification. Results of intragenic recombination analysis revealed that CPV_CP82 TH/2016 is a recombinant strain, where the recombination event occurred in the L gene with the Italian prototype CPV Bari/100-12 as the putative major parent. Selective pressure analysis demonstrated that the majority of the nucleotides in the G/ glycoprotein were under purifying selection with evidence of positive selection sites.

3|chunk|Conclusions: This collective information on the CPV TH strains is the first evidence of CPV emergence with genetic characterization in Thailand and as first report in Asia, where homologous recombination acts as a potential force driving the genetic diversity and shaping the evolution of canine pneumovirus.
