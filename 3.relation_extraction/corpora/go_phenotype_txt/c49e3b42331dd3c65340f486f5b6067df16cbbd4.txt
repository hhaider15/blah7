1|chunk|E-Predict: microarray-based species identification <p>An algorithm, E-Predict, for microarray-based species identification is presented. E-Predict compares an observed hybridization pat-tern with a set of theoretical energy profiles. Each profile represents a species that may be identified.</p> Abstract DNA microarrays may be used to identify microbial species present in environmental and clinical samples. However, automated tools for reliable species identification based on observed microarray hybridization patterns are lacking. We present an algorithm, E-Predict, for microarraybased species identification. E-Predict compares observed hybridization patterns with theoretical energy profiles representing different species. We demonstrate the application of the algorithm to viral detection in a set of clinical samples and discuss its relevance to other metagenomic applications.
