1|chunk|Canine viral diarrhea is a severe disease in dogs worldwide. The role of canine parvovirus (CPV) in canine viral diarrhea is a common health problem in dogs, attracting major concern from veterinarians and dog owners across China. In this mini-review, we summarize the CPV epidemiology in China, including its origin, prevalence, coinfection, and the genetic evolution of the virus. The review reveals the correlation between CPV-2 infection and seasonality, a dog's age/gender/breed/vaccination; that CPV-2 is the main causative agent of canine diarrhea in Northeast China and that coinfection with other pathogens is a common occurrence; the predominant CPV epidemic strains were the new CPV-2a, and CPV-2c has shown significant growth trends since 2010. This mini-review will provide valuable information for CPV infections across China and other countries.
