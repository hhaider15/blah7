1|chunk|Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) is one of the key chemokines that play important roles in diverse inflammatory and chronic pain conditions. Interstitial cystitis/ bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) is a chronic and debilitating inflammatory condition of the urinary bladder characterized by the hallmark symptoms of pelvic pain and voiding dysfunction. To facilitate IC/BPS research, we used transgenic technology to develop a novel urothelial MCP-1 secretion mouse model (URO-MCP-1). A transgene consisting of the uroplakin II gene promoter and the mouse MCP-1 coding sequence with a secretory element was constructed and microinjected. URO-MCP-1 mice were found to express MCP-1 mRNA in the bladder epithelium and MCP-1 protein in the urine, and developed bladder inflammation 24 hours after intravesical administration of a single sub-noxious dose of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The inflamed bladders of URO-MCP-1 mice exhibited elevated mRNAs for interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, substance P precursor, and nerve growth factor as well as increased macrophage infiltration. In parallel with these phenotypic changes, URO-MCP-1 mice manifested significant functional changes at days 1 and 3 after cystitis induction. These functional changes included pelvic pain as measured by von Frey filament stimulation and voiding dysfunction (increased urinary frequency, reduced average volume voided per micturition, and reduced maximum volume voided per micturition) as measured by micturition cages. Micturition changes remained evident at day 7 after cystitis induction, although these changes were not statistically significant. Control wild-type C57BL/6 mice manifested no clear changes in histological, biochemical and behavioral features after similar cystitis induction with LPS. Taken together, our results indicate that PLOS ONE | URO-MCP-1 mice are hypersensitive to bladder irritants such as LPS and develop pelvic pain and voiding dysfunction upon cystitis induction, providing a novel model for IC/BPS research.

2|chunk|Excess MCP-1 Enhances Bladder Inflammation and Symptoms PLOS ONE | Fig 4. Bladder inflammation is associated with pelvic pain in URO-MCP-1 mice. (A) Both wild-type C57BL/6 (top panels) and URO-MCP-1 mice (bottom panels) were treated intravesically with 100 l PBS or 1 g of LPS in 100 l PBS and evaluated for pelvic response to von Frey filament stimulation at 1, 3 and 7 days after intravesical treatment. The baseline pelvic responses were included for comparison. Data are shown as mean  SEM percent of response frequency. *p<0.05 as compared to baselines. The results are representative of 8 mice in each group. (B) The same C57BL/6 and URO-MCP-1 mice exhibited no significant changes in tactile sensitivity (50% threshold) of the plantar region of the hind paw at 1, 3 and 7 days after intravesical PBS or LPS treatment as compared to baselines.
