1|chunk|Infection of mice with Sindbis virus (SINV) provides a model for examining the role of the immune response to alphavirus infection of the central nervous system (CNS). Interferon-gamma (IFN-) is an important component of this response, and we show that SINV-infected differentiated neurons respond to IFN- in vitro by induction of antiviral genes and suppression of virus replication.

2|chunk|To determine the in vivo effects of IFN- on SINV clearance and T cell responses, C57BL/6 mice lacking IFN- or IFN- receptor-1 were compared to wild-type (WT) mice after intracranial SINV infection. In WT mice, IFN- was first produced in the CNS by natural killer cells and then by CD4 + and CD8 + T cells. Mice with impaired IFN- signaling initiated clearance of viral RNA earlier than WT mice associated with CNS entry of more granzyme B-producing CD8 + T cells. However, these mice established fewer CD8 + tissue-resident memory T (T RM ) cells and were more likely to experience reactivation of viral RNA synthesis late after infection. Therefore, IFN- suppresses the local development of granzyme B-expressing CD8 + T cells and slows viral RNA clearance but promotes CD8 + T RM cell establishment.

3|chunk|Viruses 2020, 12, 113 2 of 25 virus is no longer recoverable, but declining levels of viral RNA are still readily detectable. Finally, in Phase 3, from 60 days through at least a year and presumably for the life of the animal, viral RNA persists at a low level [10, 11] .

4|chunk|The immune response to alphavirus infection in the CNS presents a double-edged sword: while local production of antibody and IFN- clears infectious virus [6-9], T cell-mediated inflammation is responsible for many of the pathological changes and much of the neurological damage produced [12] [13] [14] . CD8 + T cells participate in clearance of viral RNA because CD8 and B2m knockout mice clear viral RNA more slowly from the brains and spinal cords than wild-type (WT) mice [3] .

5|chunk|IFN-, an important product of natural killer (NK) cells and CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, exerts its antiviral effects by inducing IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), but also by modulating the immune response to infection. The IFN- receptor is a heterotetramer of ligand-binding IFN-R1 and signaling IFN-R2 expressed on many cell types, including neurons [15] . IFN- binding to its receptor triggers a Jak/Stat signaling pathway that can induce expression of over 200 ISGs, some of which have direct antiviral activity, while others modulate the immune response [15] [16] [17] . IFN- is particularly important for clearance of infectious virus from spinal cord neurons [7] . IFN--induced immunomodulatory effects include immune cell activation, trafficking, and differentiation, as well as more direct intracellular antiviral activities [18] .

6|chunk|IFN- is detectable in the CNS within 3 days after infection, peaks at 7 days and becomes undetectable by 10-14 days, although IFN- mRNA remains elevated for months [9] . Previous studies have shown that mice with impaired IFN- signaling produce lower levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the CNS, resulting in better food intake and less weight loss than their WT counterparts, but entry of fewer antibody-secreting cells, slower clearance of infectious virus and more reactivation of infectious virus 18 to 21 days after infection [6] [7] [8] [9] . In the current study, we have further defined the role of IFN- by analyzing the in vitro role of IFN- in regulating SINV replication and clearance in differentiated neurons, identifying the sources of IFN- in the CNS of SINV-infected mice, and determining its role in clearance of SINV RNA and modulation of the T cell response. We show that IFN- induced an antiviral response in neurons in vitro with enhanced viral RNA clearance. In SINV-infected WT mice, IFN- was produced in the CNS by NK cells and T cells and inhibited development of the local CD8 + T cell response, resulting in slower clearance of viral RNA than in Ifng / and Ifngr1 / mice. Understanding how the immune response is able to clear both infectious virus and viral RNA while simultaneously controlling reactivation may inform development of interventions.

8|chunk|AP-7 cells, a gift from Dale Hunter (Tufts University), were derived from rat olfactory neurons and immortalized with a temperature-sensitive simian virus-40 T antigen [19] . Cycling AP-7 (cAP-7) cells were grown at 33  C with 7% CO 2 in DMEM + 10% FBS + 2 mM l-glutamine + 100 U/mL penicillin + 100 g/mL streptomycin. For differentiation, cAP-7 cells were transferred to 39  C with 5% CO 2 in DMEM + 10% FBS + 2 mM l-glutamine + 100 U/mL penicillin + 100 g/mL streptomycin + 1 g/mL insulin + 20 M dopamine + 100 M ascorbic acid for 5 to 7 days (dAP-7 cells).

9|chunk|The TE strain of SINV [20] was grown and assayed by plaque formation in BHK cells. cAP-7 or dAP-7 cells were infected with SINV TE for 1 h in DMEM + 1% FBS at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 or 5. dAP-7 cells were treated for 1 h with 500 U/mL recombinant rat IFN- (PBL Interferon Source) in DMEM + 1% FBS at 2 h before infection (IFN- Pre-Txt), 2 hours post infection (HPI, IFN- Txt 2 HPI), or 24 HPI (IFN- Txt 24 HPI). Supernatant fluids for plaque assays and cell pellets for protein and RNA analysis were collected in triplicate at indicated time points following infection and stored Viruses 2020, 12, 113 3 of 25 at 80  C. Infectious virus was quantified by plaque assay on BHK cells at 37  C, 5% CO 2 for 48 h. Plaques were counted using 10% neutral red in PBS for visualization.
