1|chunk|The study of recurrent epidemic outbreaks has been attracting great attention for decades, but its underlying mechanism is still under debate. Based on a large number of real data from different cities, we find that besides the seasonal periodic outbreaks of influenza, there are also non-periodic outbreaks, i.e. non-seasonal or non-annual behaviors. To understand how the non-periodicity shows up, we present a network model of SIRS epidemic with both time-dependent infection rate and a small possibility of persistent epidemic seeds, representing the influences from the larger annual variation of environment and the infection generated spontaneously in nature, respectively. Our numerical simulations reveal that the model can reproduce the non-periodic outbreaks of recurrent epidemics with the main features of real influenza data. Further, we find that the recurrent outbreaks of epidemic depend not only on the infection rate but also on the density of susceptible agents, indicating that they are both the necessary conditions for the recurrent epidemic patterns with nonperiodicity. A theoretical analysis based on Markov dynamics is presented to explain the numerical results. This finding may be of significance to the control of recurrent epidemics.

2|chunk|Epidemic spreading has been a challenging problem for a long time and become very hot again in the recent decade, mainly because of the fast growing of network science. It is revealed that the network structure plays a key role in this process, especially in the aspect of epidemic threshold 1-8 . So far, the studying of epidemic in complex networks has undergone three stages. In the first stage, the attention was focused on the static networks where each node represents an immobile agent and the contagion occurs only between the neighboring nodes through links. It was interestingly revealed that for scale-free networks, the epidemic threshold will be vanishingly small in the thermodynamic limit 1,2 . In the second stage, the attention was moved to the reaction-diffusion model where agents can move to their neighboring nodes with a possibility 9-12 . In this framework, the contagious process takes place only within the agents at the same node and the links are used only for diffusion. In the third stage, the research interest concentrated on how the concrete factors influence the epidemic spreading, such as the objective traveling of human being 13-15 , the interplay between epidemic spreading and network structure 16,17 , the traffic-driven epidemic spreading 18-21 , and the case of multilayer networks and temporal networks 22-34 etc. These models significantly increase our understanding on epidemic spreading and are very useful for public health authorities to assess situations quickly, make informed decisions, and optimize vaccination and drug delivery plans etc.

3|chunk|All the above studies are focused on the case of a single outbreak of epidemic and its dependence on parameters such as the network topology, received information and diffusion mode etc. However, there is another parallel line on recurrent outbreaks of epidemic although it is not hot so far. Its study is undoubtedly significant for preventing the recurrence of the new emergent viruses such as SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), H1N1 (Swine Influenza), H5H1 (Avian Influenza), Ebola, and MERS
