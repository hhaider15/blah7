1|chunk|Background: Porcine epidemic diarrhea caused by porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) has led to serious economic losses to the swine industry worldwide. In this study, an oral recombinant Lactobacillus casei vaccine against PEDV infection targeting the intestinal microfold (M) cells and dendritic cells (DCs) for delivering the core neutralizing epitope (COE) of PEDV spike protein was developed with M cell-targeting peptide (Col) and dendritic cell-targeting peptide (DCpep). The immunogenicity of the orally administered recombinant strains was evaluated.

2|chunk|Results: After immunization, significantly higher levels of anti-PEDV specific IgG antibodies with PEDV neutralizing activity in the sera and mucosal sIgA antibodies in the tractus genitalis, intestinal mucus, and stools were detected in mice orally administered with the recombinant strain pPG-COE-Col-DCpep/L393, which expressed DCpep and Col targeting ligands fused with the PEDV COE antigen, compared to mice orally immunized with the recombinant strain pPG-COE/L393 without the DCpep and Col targeting ligands. Moreover, in response to restimulation with the PEDV COE antigen in vitro, a significant difference in splenocyte proliferation response and Th2-associated cytokine IL-4 level was observed in the group of mice orally immunized with pPG-COE-Col-DCpep/L393 (p < 0.05) compared to the groups of mice that received pPG-COE-Col/L393 and pPG-COE-DCpep/L393, respectively.
