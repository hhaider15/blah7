1|chunk|Here, we report that Ring finger protein 166 (RNF166) potentiates RNA virus-triggered IFN- production. Overexpression of RNF166 rather than its homologous proteins RNF114, RNF125, and RNF138, enhanced Sendai virus (SeV)-induced activation of the IFN- promoter. Knockdown of endogenous RNF166, but not other RNFs, inhibited the IFN- production induced by SeV and encephalomyocarditis virus. RNF166 interacted with TRAF3 and TRAF6. SeV-induced ubiquitination of TRAF3 and TRAF6 was suppressed when endogenous RNF166 rather than RNF114/138 was knocked down. These findings suggest that RNF166 positively regulates RNA virus-triggered IFN- production by enhancing the ubiquitination of TRAF3 and TRAF6.

2|chunk|Innate immunity provides a robust first line of defense against invading pathogens. After detecting invading viruses, host cells initiate several signaling cascades to generate type I interferons (IFNs) such as IFN- and IFN- . Type I IFNs activate the JAK-STAT pathway, resulting in expression of hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes, which can target every stage of the viral life-cycle and protect host cells from invading viruses 1 .

3|chunk|Members of the RLR family, including retinoic acid inducible gene-I (RIG-I), melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5), and laboratory of genetics and physiology 2 (LGP2), are located in the cytoplasm to monitor viral RNA 2 . Upon viral infection, the helicase domain of RIG-I and MDA5 sense viral RNA that bears a 5 -triphosphate group that is lacking in host mRNA 3,4 . After binding viral RNA, RIG-I and MDA5 undergo conformational changes as well as modifications with K63-linked polyubiquitin chains by TRIM25 and REUL (also known as Riplet or RNF135) 5-8 . Ubiquitinated RIG-I and MDA5 interact with VISA (also named MAVS, Cardif or IPS-1) and this results in aggregation of the latter 9-12 . VISA polymers then recruit TRAFs such as TRAF3 and TRAF6 to promote the ubiquitination reaction which is critical for recruiting IKK and TBK1 to the VISA signaling complex 13 . IKK and TBK1 phosphorylate VISA, resulting in binding of VISA to the conserved, positively-charged surfaces of IRF3, thereby recruiting IRF3 for phosphorylation and activation 14 .

4|chunk|The identity of the cytoplasmic DNA sensor remained unresolved until researchers recently identified cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) as a new viral DNA sensor 15-17 . Upon DNA viral infection, cGAS directly binds to DNA and releases its catalytic pocket to ATP and GTP for the generation of 2 3 -cGAMP [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . cGAMP binds to and activates STING to assemble a punctate structure that contains TBK1. TBK1 then phosphorylates STING, and this is followed by the recruitment of IRF3 to STING for phosphorylation and activation 14 .
