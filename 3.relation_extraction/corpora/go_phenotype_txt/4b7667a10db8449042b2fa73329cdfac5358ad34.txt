1|chunk|It is unclarified as to whether viral co-detection and human metapneumovirus (HMPV) genotypes relate to clinical manifestations in children with HMPV and lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), and if the clinical course and risk factors for severe LRTI differ between HMPV and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).

2|chunk|We prospectively enrolled hospitalized children aged <16 years with LRTI from 2006 to 2015. Children were clinically examined, and nasopharyngeal aspirates were analyzed using semi-quantitative, real-time polymerase chain reaction tests for HMPV, RSV and 17 other pathogens. HMPV-positive samples were genotyped.

3|chunk|A total of 171 children had HMPV infection. HMPV-infected children with single virus (n = 106) and co-detections (n = 65) had similar clinical manifestations. No clinical differences were found between HMPV genotypes A (n = 67) and B (n = 80). The HMPV-infected children were older (median 17.2 months) than RSV-infected children (median 7.3 months, n = 859). Among single virus-infected children, no differences in age-adjusted LRTI diagnoses were found between HMPV and RSV. Age was an important factor for disease severity among single virus-infected children, where children <6 months old with HMPV had a milder disease than those with RSV, while in children 12-23 months old, the pattern was the opposite. In multivariable logistic regression analysis for each virus type, age !12 months (HMPV), and age <6 months (RSV), prematurity, !1 chronic disease and high viral loads of RSV, but not high HMPV viral loads, were risk factors for severe disease. and Technology.

4|chunk|Among hospitalized children with LRTI, HMPV manifests independently of viral co-detections and HMPV genotypes. Disease severity in HMPV-and RSV-infected children varies in relation to age. A history of prematurity and chronic disease increases the risk of severe LRTI among HMPV-and RSV-infected children.

5|chunk|Since the discovery of human metapneumovirus (HMPV) in 2001 [1], studies from all parts of the world have shown that HMPV causes respiratory tract infection (RTI) in children [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . HMPV is usually detected in airway secretions from children with RTI by use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, and the virus seldom appears in healthy children [8] . HMPV has been classified into the Pneumoviridae family. Two main genotypes (A and B) and at least four genetic subtypes (A1, A2, B1 and B2) exist [9-12]. Whether these genotypes cause similar or different infections is largely unclarified because some studies have shown quite similar manifestations [13] [14] [15] , whereas others found that either genotypes A [16, 17] or B [18] may cause more severe disease.

6|chunk|Using sensitive nucleic-acid based molecular tests to diagnose viral pathogens has revealed that many children with LRTI have more than one virus present in the respiratory tract [14, 19, 20] . Previous studies in HMPV-infected children found that such viral co-detections were associated with increased disease severity [21, 22] . However, this was not confirmed in other studies [14, 17, 19, 23] .

7|chunk|HMPV is closely related to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), by far the most important airway virus affecting children worldwide [6, 14, 20, 24] . It has been reported that RSV and HMPV infections in children may be quite similar [23, 25, 26] , but there is also some evidence that RSV causes more severe disease than HMPV [6, 18] . Risk factors for severe RSV infection are young age, prematurity, chronic lung disease, chronic heart disease and severe neurological disabilities [18, 24, [27] [28] [29] [30] . Although it has not been studied to the same extent, it seems that some of these factors may also increase the risk of severe HMPV infection [2, 17, 18, 29, [31] [32] [33] . With some exceptions [18, 29] , most studies have separately dealt with risk factors for severe HMPV and RSV infections.

8|chunk|In the present study, we prospectively enrolled a large cohort of children <16 years old, who were admitted to hospital with acute RTI during a nearly 9-year long period from 2006 to 2015, and diagnosed a broad panel of respiratory viruses. Our primary aim was to study clinical manifestations in children with HMPV lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), taking viral co-detections and HMPV genotypes into account. Our secondary aim was to compare HMPV-and RSV-infected children with LRTI, with a special emphasis on clinical manifestations and risk factors for severe disease.
