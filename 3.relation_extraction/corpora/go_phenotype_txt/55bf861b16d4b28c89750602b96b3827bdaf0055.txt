1|chunk|Background: Human adenoviruses are a common group of viruses that cause acute infectious diseases. Human adenovirus (HAdV) 3 and HAdV 7 cause major outbreaks of severe pneumonia. A reliable and practical method for HAdV typing in clinical laboratories is lacking. A simple, rapid and accurate molecular typing method for HAdV may facilitate clinical diagnosis and epidemiological control. Methods: We developed and evaluated duplex real-time recombinase-aided amplification (RAA) assays incorporating competitive internal controls for detection of HAdV 3 and HAdV 7, respectively. The assays were performed in a onestep in a single tube reaction at 39for 20 min. Results: The analytical sensitivities of the duplex RAA assays for HAdV 3 and HAdV 7 were 5.0 and 14.8 copies per reaction, respectively (at 95% probability by probit regression analysis). No cross-reaction was observed with other types of HAdV or other common respiratory viruses. The duplex RAA assays were used to detect 152 previouslydefined HAdV-positive samples. These results agreed with those obtained using a published triplex quantitative realtime PCR protocol. Conclusions: We provide the first report of internally-controlled duplex RAA assays for the detection of HAdV 3 and HAdV 7. These assays effectively reduce the rate of false negative results and may be valuable for detection of HAdV 3 and HAdV 7 in clinical laboratories, especially in resource-poor settings.
