1|chunk|Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a great public health concern globally. Although 83% of the globally confirmed cases have emerged in Saudi Arabia, the spatiotemporal clustering of MERS-CoV incidence has not been investigated. This study analysed the spatiotemporal patterns and clusters of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases reported in Saudi Arabia between June 2012 and March 2019. Temporal, seasonal, spatial and spatiotemporal cluster analyses were performed using Kulldorff's spatial scan statistics to determine the time period and geographical areas with the highest MERS-CoV infection risk. A strongly significant temporal cluster for MERS-CoV infection risk was identified between April 5 and May 24, 2014. Most MERS-CoV infections occurred during the spring season (41.88%), with April and May showing significant seasonal clusters. Wadi Addawasir showed a high-risk spatial cluster for MERS-CoV infection. The most likely high-risk MERS-CoV annual spatiotemporal clusters were identified for a group of cities (n = 10) in Riyadh province between 2014 and 2016. A monthly spatiotemporal cluster included Jeddah, Makkah and Taif cities, with the most likely high-risk MERS-CoV infection cluster occurring between April and May 2014. Significant spatiotemporal clusters of MERS-CoV incidence were identified in Saudi Arabia. The findings are relevant to control the spread of the disease. This study provides preliminary risk assessments for the further investigation of the environmental risk factors associated with MERS-CoV clusters. these included persons who handle live camels (e.g., camel workers, camel salesmen, camel shepherds, slaughterhouse workers, animal and waste transporters) and persons who administer medications to camels or clean camel medical equipment [6] [7] [8] . Nevertheless, most patients report no exposure to camels [9] . The global camel population is estimated at approximately 35 million camels [10]; of these, 95% are dromedary camels [11] . In Saudi Arabia, the camel is considered a national, socio-cultural heritage animal and is central in the livestock economy, as it is used for milk or meat and in a traditional race festival (locally known as Mazain al-Ibal) [12] . The number of camels in Saudi Arabia is estimated at more than 1.39 million heads [13] and has been growing annually by 5.2% since 1961 [10]. Information is lacking regarding the distribution of camels in Saudi Arabia. In June 2019, the Saudi Ministry of Environment, Water and Agriculture launched an electronic system for numbering and tracking camels in order to create a database on them through the use of microchip implants [14] . This endeavor is a part of a wider initiative to control animal diseases and to create a database on each camel and its owner. The new project will help improve camel health and control the spread of zoonotic diseases.

2|chunk|No permanent and sustained human-to-human transmission has been observed despite close contact with MERS-CoV-infected patients [15] . However, nosocomial transmission in healthcare facilities between patients and healthcare workers and between patients sharing spaces in healthcare facilities represents the main mode of human-to-human infection [16] . MERS-CoV outbreaks linked to healthcare settings have occurred in several countries, with the largest being in Saudi Arabia, especially in 2014 and 2015 [17] [18] [19] . This may be due to inadequate, inconsistent or incomplete compliance with infection prevention and control practices, limited isolation of suspected MERS-CoV patients and patient crowdedness [20] . Furthermore, household transmission was observed from patients to other household members, but this was less striking than other modes of transmission [15, 17, 18, 21] . In Saudi Arabia, the probable risk factors for MERS-CoV infection were older age [20, 22] , male sex [22] , exposure to dromedary camels, comorbidities and smoking [23] . For household transmission, the identified risk factors were sleeping in an index patient's room, removing a patient's waste or touching respiratory secretions [21] . The factors related to MERS-CoV mortality were mainly old age and the existence of underlying comorbidities [22, 24] .

3|chunk|The spread of an infectious disease is an instance of spatiotemporal diffusion processes at work, in which the emergence of the disease moves across space and changes in extent over time [25] . Geographic information systems (GIS) offer a means to visualize, analyze and understand the distribution of infectious diseases over space and time, thereby revealing spatiotemporal trends, patterns and associations between the pathological factors and the geographic environments of the disease [26, 27] . Exploiting the analytical, modelling and simulation features of GIS has improved epidemiological outbreak investigation and response, in which recognizing the spatial spread and transmission dynamics of an emerging infectious disease is essential for advising on efficient disease control and prevention measures [28] . However, since the first reported case of MERS-CoV in 2012, there has been a paucity of studies addressing the spatial dimension of the distribution of this disease. With the use of ecological modelling in a GIS environment [29], a preliminary transmission risk map of MERS-CoV was produced across the Middle East by analyzing the spatial distribution of MERS-CoV cases and environmental transmission risk factors (bioclimatic variables). This suggests that the transmission route of the disease via camel exposure plays a major role. However, the effects of environmental risk factors on disease transmission were not explicitly determined. A geo-additive regression model was also utilized to examine the risk factor levels of individuals for MERS-CoV mortality in the Arabian Peninsula between 2012 and 2015 [30], and significant spatial variation and clustering with a lower risk were found in Riyadh, Arar, Aljouf and Jizan, whereas a higher risk was observed in Qassim province. However, the spatial analysis lacked detail at the governorate and city levels. The application of an iterative empirical process in a GIS environment revealed that high-camel-density areas, camel convergence points (camel markets, barns, breeding sites and slaughterhouses), former MERS-CoV cases and high seroprevalence rates were the potential risk factors for spatial MERS-CoV hotspots in Kenya [31]. Considering the space and time dimensions of the MERS-CoV, one study highlighted that
