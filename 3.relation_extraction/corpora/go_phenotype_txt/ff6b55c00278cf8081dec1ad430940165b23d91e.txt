1|chunk|Background: We describe human rhinovirus (HRV) detections in SaKaeo province, Thailand.

2|chunk|Methods: From September 1, 2003-August 31, 2005, we tested hospitalized patients with acute lower respiratory illness and outpatient controls without fever or respiratory symptoms for HRVs with polymerase chain reaction and molecularlytyped select HRVs. We compared HRV detection among hospitalized patients and controls and estimated enrollment adjusted incidence.

2	150	155 fever	Phenotype	HP_0001945

3|chunk|Results: HRVs were detected in 315 (16%) of 1919 hospitalized patients and 27 (9.6%) of 280 controls. Children had the highest frequency of HRV detections (hospitalized: ,1 year: 29%, 1-4 year: 29%, $65 years: 9%; controls: ,1 year: 24%, 1-4 year: 14%, $65 years: 2.8%). Enrollment adjusted hospitalized HRV detection rates were highest among persons aged ,1 year (1038/100,000 persons/year), 1-4 years (457), and $65 years (71). All three HRV species were identified, HRV-A was the most common species in most age groups including children aged ,1 year (61%) and all adult age groups. HRV-C was the most common species in the 1-4 year (51%) and 5-19 year age groups (54%). Compared to controls, hospitalized adults ($19 years) and children were more likely to have HRV detections (odds ratio [OR]: 4.8, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.5, 15.8; OR: 2.0, CI: 1.2, 3.3, respectively) and hospitalized children were more likely to have HRV-A (OR 1.7, CI: 0.8, 3.5) or HVR-C (OR 2.7, CI: 1.2, 5.9) detection.

4|chunk|Conclusions: HRV rates were high among hospitalized children and the elderly but asymptomatic children also had substantial HRV detection. HRV (all species), and HRV-A and HRV-C detections were epidemiologically-associated with hospitalized illness. Treatment or prevention modalities effective against HRV could reduce hospitalizations due to HRV in Thailand.
