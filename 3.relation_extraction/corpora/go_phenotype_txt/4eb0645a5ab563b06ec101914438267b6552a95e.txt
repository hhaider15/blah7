1|chunk|A total of forty novel glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) derivatives were designed and synthesized. The cytotoxic activity of the novel compounds was tested against two human breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, MDA-MB-231) in vitro by the MTT method. The evaluation results revealed that, in comparison with GA, compound 42 shows the most promising anticancer activity (IC 50 1.880.20 and 1.370.18 M for MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231, respectively) and merits further exploration as a new anticancer agent.
