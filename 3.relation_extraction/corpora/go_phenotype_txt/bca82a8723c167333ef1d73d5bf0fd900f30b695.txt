1|chunk|The unique ability of bats to act as reservoir for viruses that are highly pathogenic to humans suggests unique properties and functional characteristics of their immune system. However, the lack of bat specific reagents, in particular antibodies, has limited our knowledge of bat's immunity. Using crossreactive antibodies, we report the phenotypic and functional characterization of T cell subsets, B and NK cells in the fruit-eating bat Pteropus alecto. Our findings indicate the predominance of CD8 + T cells in the spleen from wild-caught bats that may reflect either the presence of viruses in this organ or predominance of this cell subset at steady state. Instead majority of T cells in circulation, lymph nodes and bone marrow (BM) were CD4 + subsets. Interestingly, 40% of spleen T cells expressed constitutively IL-17, IL-22 and TGF- mRNA, which may indicate a strong bias towards the Th17 and regulatory T cell subsets. Furthermore, the unexpected high number of T cells in bats BM could suggest an important role in T cell development. Finally, mitogenic stimulation induced proliferation and production of effector molecules by bats immune cells. This work contributes to a better understanding of bat's immunity, opening up new perspectives of therapeutic interventions for humans.

2|chunk|In recent years bats have been recognized as important reservoirs of highly pathogenic viruses for human and other animals such as SARS coronavirus, Hendra, and Nipah viruses 1,2 . Bats have also been proposed as potential reservoir for Ebola 3 and MERS 4 , although direct evidence is still lacking. How do bats cope with viruses that have a high mortality rate in humans without getting sick? How have they evolved to co-exist with such viruses? Understanding the bats immune system should help address this question and might open a door to new therapeutic interventions for humans.

3|chunk|Immunity in mammals comprises two main arms, namely the innate and the adaptive immunity, that interact with each other to generate optimal responses against pathogens. The innate immunity provides immediate nonspecific host defenses and is highly conserved among species; whereas the adaptive immunity is restricted to higher organisms and involves antigen-specific T and B cells 5 . Pathogen-derived antigens are presented by antigen presenting cells (APC) such as macrophages and dendritic cells (DC) to antigen-specific T and B cells in secondary lymphoid organs such as lymph nodes, spleen and various mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues (MALT) 6 . The antigen-specific T or B cells get then activated, proliferate and migrate to the site of infection where they fight the invading pathogen through antibody production and/or direct killing of the infected cells.

4|chunk|The effector T lymphocyte population can be broadly divided into two subsets, namely T helper cells (Th) and cytotoxic T cells (CTL), which are identified by the expression of CD4 and CD8 molecules on their surface, respectively 7 . Upon activation CD4 + Th cells produce cytokines, which are essential to help recruit and further activate/differentiate other immune cell types 8 . For example, CD4 + Th are critical for B cell differentiation into
