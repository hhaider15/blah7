1|chunk|Despite the availability of highly effective direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimens for the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections, sustained viral response (SVR) rates remain suboptimal for difficult-to-treat patient populations such as those with HCV genotype 3, cirrhosis or prior treatment experience, warranting development of more potent HCV replication antivirals. AT-527 is the hemi-sulfate salt of AT-511, a novel phosphoramidate prodrug of 2'fluoro-2'-C-methylguanosine-5'-monophosphate that has potent in vitro activity against HCV. The EC 50 of AT-511, determined using HCV laboratory strains and clinical isolates with genotypes 1-5, ranged from 5-28 nM. The active 5'-triphosphate metabolite, AT-9010, specifically inhibited the HCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. AT-511 did not inhibit the replication of other selected RNA or DNA viruses in vitro. AT-511 was approximately 10-fold more active than sofosbuvir (SOF) against a panel of laboratory strains and clinical isolates of HCV genotypes 1-5 and remained fully active against S282T resistance-associated variants, with up to 58-fold more potency than SOF. In vitro, AT-511 did not inhibit human DNA polymerases or elicit cytotoxicity or mitochondrial toxicity at concentrations up to 100 M. Unlike the other potent guanosine analogs PSI-938 and PSI-661, no mutagenic O 6 -alkylguanine bases were formed when incubated with cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, and AT-511 had IC 50 values 25 M against a panel of CYP enzymes. In hepatocytes from multiple species, the active triphosphate was the predominant metabolite produced from the prodrug, with a half-life of 10 h in human hepatocytes. When given orally to rats and monkeys, AT-527 preferentially delivered high levels of AT-9010 in the liver in vivo. These favorable preclinical attributes support the ongoing clinical development of AT-527 and suggest that, when used in combination with an HCV DAA from a different class, AT-527 may increase SVR rates, especially for difficult-to-treat patient populations, and could potentially shorten treatment duration for all patients.

3|chunk|Putative metabolic pathway for AT-527. When dissolved, AT-527 releases its free base AT-511. Sequential hydrolysis, catalyzed by human cathepsin A (CatA) and/or carboxylesterase 1 (CES1) followed by spontaneous cleavage of the then unstable phenolic moiety, produces the L-alanyl intermediate (M1). Removal of the amino acid moiety by histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 1 (HINT1) results in metabolite M2 which can then be converted to M3 by adenosine deaminase like protein 1 (ADALP1). M3 is further anabolized sequentially by guanylate kinase 1 (GUK1) and nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK) to the pharmacologically active triphosphate, AT-9010. Both M2 and M3 can be dephosphorylated by 5'-nucleotidase (5'-NTase) to their respective nucleosides M4 and AT-273.
