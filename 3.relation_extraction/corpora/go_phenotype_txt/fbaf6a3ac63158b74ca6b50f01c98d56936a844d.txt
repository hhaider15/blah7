1|chunk|In mammalian cells, widespread acceleration of cytoplasmic mRNA degradation is linked to impaired RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription. This mRNA decay-induced transcriptional repression occurs during infection with gammaherpesviruses including Kaposi's sarcomaassociated herpesvirus (KSHV) and murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68), which encode an mRNA endonuclease that initiates widespread RNA decay. Here, we show that MHV68induced mRNA decay leads to a genome-wide reduction of Pol II occupancy at mammalian promoters. This reduced Pol II occupancy is accompanied by down-regulation of multiple Pol II subunits and TFIIB in the nucleus of infected cells, as revealed by mass spectrometrybased global measurements of protein abundance. Viral genes, despite the fact that they require Pol II for transcription, escape transcriptional repression. Protection is not governed by viral promoter sequences; instead, location on the viral genome is both necessary and sufficient to escape the transcriptional repression effects of mRNA decay. We propose a model in which the ability to escape from transcriptional repression is linked to the localization of viral DNA within replication compartments, providing a means for these viruses to counteract decay-induced transcript loss.

2|chunk|While transcription and messenger RNA (mRNA) decay are often considered to be the unlinked beginning and end of gene expression, recent data indicate that alterations to either stage can impact the other. Here we study this connection in the context of lytic gammaherpesvirus infection, which accelerates mRNA degradation through the expression of the viral endonuclease muSOX. We show that RNA polymerase II promoter occupancy is broadly reduced across mammalian promoters in response to infection-induced mRNA PLOS Pathogens | https://doi.
