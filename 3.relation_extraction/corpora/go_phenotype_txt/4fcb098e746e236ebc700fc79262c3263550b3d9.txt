Although NP is regarded as a promising antiviral druggable target, no chemical ligands have been reported to interact with EBOV NP or MARV NP. We identified two compounds from a traditional Chinese medicine Gancao (licorice root) that can bind both NPs by combining affinity mass spectrometry and metabolomics approaches. These two ligands, 18-glycyrrhetinic acid and licochalcone A, were verified by defined compound mixture screens and further characterized with individual ligand binding assays. Accompanying biophysical analyses demonstrate that binding of 18-glycyrrhetinic acid to EBOV NP significantly reduces protein thermal stability, induces formation of large NP oligomers, and disrupts the critical association of viral ssRNA with NP complexes whereas the compound showed no such activity on MARV NP. Our study has revealed the substantial potential of new analytical techniques in ligand discovery from natural herb resources. In addition, identification of a chemical ligand that influences the oligomeric state and RNA-binding function of EBOV NP sheds new light on antiviral drug development.

The recent largest filovirus epidemic in Western Africa caused by EBOV Makona variant, and the import of EBOV to non-African countries highlights the public health impact of these pathogens.

3|chunk|EBOV has a single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) genome that is transcribed upon virus entry into the host cytosol before generation of at least eight distinct viral proteins 3-6 . Viral genome replication and mRNA transcription are carried out by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase complex (RDRP) 4 . This complex consists of the viral polymerase (L), the viral nucleoprotein (NP), along with polymerase cofactors VP35 and VP30. For all members in the filovirus family, the single-stranded viral genomic RNAs are encapsidated by NPs so that the viral genome can be protected from recognition by the cellular innate immune system or degradation by ribonucleases 7,8 .
