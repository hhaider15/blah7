1|chunk|Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), a member of Alphacoronavirus, has caused huge economic losses for the global pork industry recently. The spike (S) protein mediates PEDV entry into host cells. Herein, we investigated the interactions between the S protein and its receptor porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN) or co-receptor sugars. The C-terminal domain (CTD) of the S1 domain is bound to pAPN. The prototype strain demonstrated similar receptor-binding activity compared with the variant field isolate. Three loops at the tips of the -barrel domains did not play crucial roles in the PEDV S-pAPN association, indicating that PEDV conforms to a different receptor recognition model compared with transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine respiratory CoV (PRCV), and human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63). The N-terminal domain (NTD) of the PEDV S1 domain could bind sugar, a possible co-receptor for PEDV. The prototype strain exhibited weaker sugar-binding activity compared with the variant field isolate. Strategies targeting the receptor binding domain (RBD) may be helpful for developing vaccines or antiviral drugs for PEDV. Understanding the differences in receptor binding between the prototype and the variant strains may provide insight into PEDV pathogenesis. Viruses 2016, 8, 55 2 of 15

2|chunk|the Betacoronavirus genus uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as its receptor, and its receptor-binding domain (RBD) is located within CTD of the S1 domain [3] . ACE2 is also a receptor for human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63), in which three discontinuous fragments located within CTD of the S1 domain are responsible for receptor binding [4] . No structural homology has been found between the SARS and HCoV-NL63 RBDs, but they recognize the same receptor (ACE2). Meanwhile, their RBDs share the same receptor recognition hotspots [5] . The RBD of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is located within CTD of the S1 domain. The RBD crystal structures of TGEV and HCoV-NL63 show similarities, but they use different receptors [2] . The RBDs of murine hepatitis virus (MHV) and bovine coronavirus (BCoV) in the same genus of Betacoronaviruses are located in the N-terminus of the S1 domain. However, carcinoembryonic antigen cell adhesion molecule (CEACAM) and sugar serve as the receptors for MHV and BCoV, respectively, despite their high sequence homology [6, 7] .

3|chunk|PEDV belongs to the Alphacoronavirus genus and can cause an acute and highly contagious enteric disease. Its clinical symptoms include watery diarrhea, severe enteritis, vomiting, and weight loss; the mortality rate can reach 50%-90% in suckling piglets [8] [9] [10] . In 1977, Pensaert isolated a new coronavirus-like particle associated with diarrhea from Belgian swine breeding farms. This virus was different from TGEV and was designated CV777 [11] . Subsequently, the disease was reported in the United . Since 2010, massive PED outbreaks have been reported in Asia. In April 2013, there was a sudden occurrence of PED disease that rapidly spread across the United States, causing high rates of death among piglets [8] . Currently, PED is considered a pandemic disease that causes substantial economic losses to pork producers all over the world.

4|chunk|The genome of PEDV contains 28 kb which encodes the polyproteins ORF1a and ORF1b, S, open reading frame 3 (ORF3), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins [12, 13] . The PEDV S protein is a homotrimeric membrane glycoprotein that contains a signal peptide (residues 1-20); an S1 region (residues 21-793) that mediates the attachment of virus particles to the cell surface receptor; an S2 region (residues 794-1385) that mediates virus fusion to host cells; a transmembrane domain (residues 1335-1358) and a cytoplasmic tail (residues 1359-1385); the S1 region contains two subdomains, an NTD (residues 21-324) and a CTD (residues 253-638) [14, 15] ( Figure 1A ). Previous studies have confirmed that porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN) acts as a receptor for PEDV entry into target cells [16] [17] [18] . All characterized coronavirus S1 domain contain an RBD that is responsible for interactions with the cellular receptors for viral attachment. Lee determined that the N-terminus of the PEDV S1 domain was necessary for receptor binding using a co-immunoprecipitation assay; the minimal binding region was confirmed to be located within residues 25-88 [14]. To date, there are no conclusive data concerning the exact location of the PEDV RBD and the key amino acids that participate in receptor binding.

5|chunk|The major genetic variations of coronaviruses have been reported to be concentrated in the S1 portion of the S gene. Even a single amino acid mutation can change the virulence of a given virus [7, 19] . The sequences of the PEDV S1 domain differ between the prototype and variant strains, especially at the N-terminus ( Figure 1B) . For example, a six-amino-acid insertion was identified in the variant strain (residues 56-60 and 141) [20, 21] . Amino acid deletions have also been identified within the S1 domain (residues 155, 156, 163, and 164) [13,22]. Whether the mutated amino acids are located within the RBD and are capable of affecting the binding affinity to its receptor and then affecting the virulence or pathogenicity is unknown.

6|chunk|In this study, the RBD of the PEDV S1 domain was identified, and the receptor-binding activity was compared between the variant strain CHGD-01 and the prototype CV777 strain. The motifs responsible for receptor binding were predicted and verified using mutagenesis. Finally, the sugar-binding domain of PEDV was determined, and the binding activity was compared between the CHGD-01 and CV777 strains.
