1|chunk|year, methodologies for rapid and on-site detection of influenza viruses are urgently needed. LAMP is the most commonly used nucleic acid isothermal amplification technology suitable for on-site use. However, for multiplex LAMP, differentiation of the amplicons derived from multiple targets is still challengeable currently. Here we developed a multiplex RT-LAMP assay for simultaneous amplification of three prominent subtypes of influenza viruses (A/H5, A/H7 and 2009A/H1). The amplicons were further identified by cascade invasive reaction and nanoparticle hybridization in separate target-specific detection tubes (referred to as mRT-LAMP-IRNH). The analytic sensitivities of the assay are 10 copies of RNA for all the three HA subtypes, and the specificity reached 100%. Clinical specimen analysis showed this assay had a combined sensitivity and specificity of 98.1% and 100%, respectively. Overall, the mRT-LAMP-IRNH assay can be used as a cost-saving method that utilizes a simple instrument to detect A/H5, A/H7, and 2009A/H1 influenza viruses, especially in resource-limited settings.
