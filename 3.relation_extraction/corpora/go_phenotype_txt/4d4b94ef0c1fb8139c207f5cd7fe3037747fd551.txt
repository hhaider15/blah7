0|chunk|The Placental Protein Syncytin-1 Impairs Antiviral Responses and Exaggerates Inflammatory Responses to Influenza

1|chunk|Pregnancy increases susceptibility to influenza. The placenta releases an immunosuppressive endogenous retroviral protein syncytin-1. We hypothesised that exposure of peripheral monocytes (PBMCs) to syncytin-1 would impair responses to H1N1pdm09 influenza.

2|chunk|Recombinant syncytin-1 was produced. PBMCs from non-pregnant women (n=10) were exposed to H1N1pdm09 in the presence and absence of syncytin-1 and compared to responses of PBMCs from pregnant women (n=12). PBMCs were characterised using flow cytometry, release of interferon (IFN)-, IFN-, IFN-, IL-10, IL-2, IL-6 and IL-1 were measured by cytometric bead array or ELISA. Exposure of PBMCs to H1N1pdm09 resulted in the release of IFN-, (14,787 pg/mL, 95% CI 7311-22,264 pg/mL) IFN- (1486 pg/mL, 95% CI 756-2216 pg/mL) and IFN- (852 pg/mL, 95% CI 193-1511 pg/mL) after 48 hours. This was significantly impaired in pregnant women (IFN-; p<0.0001 and IFN-; p<0.001). Furthermore, in the presence of syncytin-1, PBMCs demonstrated marked reductions in IFN- and IFN-, while enhanced release of IL-10 as well as IL-6 and IL-1.
