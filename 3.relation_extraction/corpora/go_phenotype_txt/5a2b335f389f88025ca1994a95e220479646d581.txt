0|chunk|viruses Diagnosis of Feline Infectious Peritonitis: A Review of the Current Literature

1|chunk|Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a fatal disease that poses several challenges for veterinarians: clinical signs and laboratory changes are non-specific, and there are two pathotypes of the etiologic agent feline coronavirus (FCoV), sometimes referred to as feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) and feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) that vary fundamentally in their virulence, but are indistinguishable by a number of diagnostic methods. This review focuses on all important steps every veterinary practitioner has to deal with and new diagnostic tests that can be considered when encountering a cat with suspected FIP with the aim to establish a definitive diagnosis. It gives an overview on all available direct and indirect diagnostic tests and their sensitivity and specificity reported in the literature in different sample material. By providing summarized data for sensitivity and specificity of each diagnostic test and each sample material, which can easily be accessed in tables, this review can help to facilitate the interpretation of different diagnostic tests and raise awareness of their advantages and limitations. Additionally, diagnostic trees depict recommended diagnostic steps that should be performed in cats suspected of having FIP based on their clinical signs or clinicopathologic abnormalities. These steps can easily be followed in clinical practice.

2|chunk|FIP occurs most often in young cats under two years of age [7] . Male cats [7] and certain breeds are suggested to be overrepresented [8] [9] [10] . Clinical signs, such as anorexia, lethargy, weight loss, pyrexia, ocular and neurological signs like gait abnormalities or abnormal mentation, are non-specific [7, [11] [12] [13] [14] . The same is true for clinicopathologic abnormalities. In general, tests using effusion have much better predictive values than tests using blood [15, 16] . Thus, ante mortem diagnosis of FIP is especially difficult in cats without significant effusion. Since a definitive diagnosis cannot be made based on signalment, history and clinical and laboratory signs alone, these parameters should always be evaluated as an entity and potentially in conjunction with other parameters, such as results of molecular or even more invasive diagnostic tests. In order to avoid falsely diagnosing FIP in unaffected cats, specificity is always the most important diagnostic value to consider.

3|chunk|Hematological abnormalities are very common in cats with FIP. Reported changes mainly include anemia (non-regenerative as well as regenerative anemia can be present, e.g., immune-mediated hemolytic anemia has been reported), microcytosis with or without anemia, lymphopenia (more commonly in cats with effusion), band neutrophilia (with or without segmented neutrophilia) and thrombocytopenia. Whereas microcytosis and band neutrophilia are common features of FIP in general, lymphopenia, observed in about 50% of cats with FIP, can be seen significantly more commonly in cats with effusion, but is reported only rarely in cats without effusion. The vast majority of cats with FIP also have abnormalities upon serum biochemistry. In particular, hyperproteinemia, and especially hyperglobulinemia (that can also be present without an increase in total serum protein), hypoalbuminemia (more common in cats with effusion), hyperbilirubinemia (more common in cats with effusion) and potentially, depending on organ involvement, azotemia (detected more often in cats without effusion) or increased liver enzyme activities can be present. The most common abnormality reported is hyperglobulinemia, documented in about 89% of cats with FIP [7]. These changes can occur in variable combinations but it is important to note that they absolutely are neither pathognomonic nor specific for FIP, meaning that they can occur in any cat suffering from various diseases with an inflammatory basis, which represent differential diagnoses for FIP [7, [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . Hyperglobulinemia in cats with FIP can occur either alone or in combination with hypoalbuminemia or hyperproteinemia. Although it has been suggested that the albumin to globulin (A:G) ratio has better diagnostic utility than the gamma-globulin or total protein concentration alone [16] and several cut-offs have been suggested to potentially rule in (<0.4) or rule out (>0.6-0.8) FIP [16, 19, [21] [22] [23] , the A:G ratio, as other hematological and serum biochemistry changes, should only be interpreted in conjunction with signalment, history, other laboratory parameters and possibly molecular diagnostic methods. Elevated gamma-globulin concentrations can be either polyclonal (more common) or monoclonal as differentiated by serum protein electrophoresis [24] . Thus, if a cat presents with any of the aforementioned clinicopathologic abnormalities in routine practice, these always have to be interpreted in conjunction with other clinical, laboratory or imaging findings. They might only support a suspicion of FIP if other abnormalities consistent with FIP are present as well and FIP should never be diagnosed solely on the basis of hematological or biochemical parameters.

4|chunk|Cats with FIP often exhibit markedly increased concentrations of acute phase proteins (APP), such as alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AGP), serum amyloid A (SAA) or haptoglobin in serum [11, [25] [26] [27] [28] . Still, although these parameters can help in establishing a diagnosis and a negative AGP measurement can potentially exclude FIP [15], on their own, they are not pathognomonic for FIP. Increased concentrations of APP can also be found in cats with various other inflammatory conditions, neoplasia or even in healthy FECV-infected cats [25] [26] [27] [29] [30] [31] [32] . As was stated before for hematological and serum biochemical parameters, measurement of APP, such as AGP, can only be helpful when interpreted together with other abnormalities in order to provide an index of suspicion of FIP in an individual cat [28] .

5|chunk|The majority of cats with FIP present with effusion-specifically, pleural effusion, ascites or a combination of both [7, 13] . Even cases of pericardial effusion have been reported [33] . The typical fluid from a cat with FIP is viscous, straw-colored, clear to moderately cloudy and usually forms clots or strings because of its high protein content [34] . Macroscopic and cytologic examination of those effusions and determination of cell count and biochemical parameters is important in order to exclude or confirm other differential diagnoses (such as lymphoma by cytology or bacterial peritonitis or pleuritis by cytology and bacterial culture); but again, changes are not specific for FIP [11, 15, [35] [36] [37] . Although typical effusions from cats with FIP have a high protein content, low A:G ratio [16, 38] and rather low total cell count [34] , these findings can also occur in effusions of other etiologies. Nevertheless, in a cat which presents with typical signalment, clinical and routine laboratory abnormalities (such as for example a young cat with fever, icterus, anemia, hyperglobulinemia) and effusion, effusion analysis including cytology and bacterial culture, although not completely specific for FIP, can exclude other conditions that could confound the diagnosis and can at least help in increasing the pre-test probability for FIP.

6|chunk|The Rivalta's test is a cheap and quick test that can easily be performed on effusions in clinical practice, which is why, in the authors' opinion, it should be included in the diagnostic protocol in every cat with effusion. It has good sensitivity for excluding FIP (91-100%), meaning that whenever it is negative, other potential causes for effusion are much more likely than FIP. Therefore, especially if financial concerns limit the number of diagnostic tests that can be performed, the Rivalta's test can at least be used to exclude FIP with satisfying negative predictive value with the advantage of no need for any automated analysis. However, its specificity was reported to be only 66-81% [16, 39] . Since the Rivalta's test is positive most likely secondary to increased amounts of protein and inflammatory mediators in a fluid, it was originally used to differentiate transudates and exudates [40] , and therefore can also be positive in effusions caused by bacterial peritonitis/pleuritis or lymphoma [16] . These conditions, however, can usually easily be diagnosed by routine cytology and culture of the effusion, which should also always be performed when analyzing an effusion sample.

7|chunk|Another test that relies on the abundance of proteins in effusions from cats with FIP is the measurement of the delta total nucleated cell count (TNC) in an automated hematologic analyzer (Sysmex XT-2000iV, Sysmex Europe, Norderstedt, Denmark), measuring leucocytes in two different channels. The ratio between both channels, the TNC, is higher in cats with FIP than in healthy cats, and its measurement showed quite good diagnostic accuracy. Using a cut-off of 1.7 for TNC, diagnostic sensitivity of the method was 79-90%; specificity was 94-100%. Higher cut-offs of 2.5 or 3.4 even increased specificity to 100% [15,41,42].

8|chunk|Neurological signs are more likely to occur in the population of cats with FIP without significant effusion [7] . The CSF is often sampled after diagnostic imaging of the central nervous system in order to reach a diagnosis. Upon clinicopathological examination, an increased protein content and pleocytosis can be noted in the CSF of cats with FIP [14, [43] [44] [45] [46] . CSF cytology often reveals a mixed or suppurative inflammation; mononuclear infiltration can be seen as well. Unremarkable CSF cytology can also occur [46] . However, all these changes can also be present in cats with other neurologic diseases, and some cats with neurological signs caused by FIP have normal CSF analysis [45].

9|chunk|Eye involvement, which includes pyogranulomatous and granulomatous uveitis and chorioretinitis with a mixed uveal inflammatory cell infiltrate and predominance of B lymphocytes and plasma cells [47] [48] [49] , was reported in up to 29% of cats with confirmed FIP [13] . Aqueocentesis can provide Viruses 2019, 11, 1068 4 of 35 aqueous humor for cytological and clinicopathological testing; however, cytology is often non-diagnostic or more useful to diagnose lymphoma [50] [51] [52] .

10|chunk|FCoV infection leads to the production of specific antibodies, independently of the development of FIP [53] [54] [55] . After experimental infection, serum antibodies are detectable as early as seven to 28 days after infection [3, 6, 54, [56] [57] [58] [59] .

11|chunk|The first assay to detect anti-FCoV antibodies was developed in 1976 [60] . By now, there are a number of different test methods: indirect immunofluorescence antibody tests (IFAT) using either FCoV [60] [61] [62] or transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) [62-65] as antigen, virus neutralization (VN) assays, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) [62,66,67] and rapid immunochromatographic tests (RIM) [62]. An ideal test should work on different fluids, such as serum and effusion, have high sensitivity and specificity, should allow the use of small sample quantities, provide a quantitative value and a rapid result. For excluding a diagnosis of FIP (if at all possible by antibody detection), all of these aspects matter. For FCoV screening, especially sensitivity and test rapidity are important [62].
