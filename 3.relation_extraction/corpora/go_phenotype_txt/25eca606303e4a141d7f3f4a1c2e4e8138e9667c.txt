1|chunk|A 17.5-kDa trypsin inhibitor was purified from Phaseolus vulgaris cv. "gold bean" with an isolation protocol including ion exchange chromatography on DEAE-cellulose (Diethylaminoethylcellulose), affinity chromatography on Affi-gel blue gel, ion exchange chromatography on SP-sepharose (Sulfopropyl-sepharose), and gel filtration by FPLC (Fast protein liquid chromatography) on Superdex 75. It dose-dependently inhibited trypsin with an IC 50 value of 0.4 M, and this activity was reduced in the presence of dithiothreitol in a dose-and time-dependent manner, signifying the importance of the disulfide linkage to the activity. It inhibited [methyl-3 H] thymidine incorporation by leukemia L1210 cells and lymphoma MBL2 cells with an IC 50 value of 2.3 M and 2.5 M, respectively. The inhibitor had no effect on fungal growth and the activities of various viral enzymes when tested up to 100 M.
