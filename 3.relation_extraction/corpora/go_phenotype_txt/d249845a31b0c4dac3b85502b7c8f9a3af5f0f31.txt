1|chunk|We present the structure of the surface Ebola virus (EBOV) trimeric glycoprotein (GP) spike at 11  resolution, in situ within the viral plasma membrane of purified virus particles. GP functions in cellular attachment, endosomal entry, and membrane fusion to initiate infection, and is a key therapeutic target. Nevertheless, only about half of the GP molecule has yet been solved to atomic resolution, excluding the mucin-like and transmembrane domains, and some of the glycans. Fitting of the atomic resolution X-ray data from expressed, truncated deletion constructs within our 11  structure of the entire molecule demonstrates the relationship between the GP1-GP2 domains, the mucin-like and transmembrane domains, and the bilaminar lipid envelope. We show that the mucin-like domain covers the glycan cap and partially occludes the receptor binding sites prior to proteolytic cleavage. Our structure is also consistent with key antibody neutralisation sites on GP being accessible prior to proteolysis. Based on the findings of us and others, GP-mediated binding may create an angle of 18 degrees between the planes of viral and endosomal membranes.

2|chunk|Ebola viruses (EBOVs) cause periodic outbreaks of severe hemorrhagic disease 1 . The recent deadly outbreak in West Africa (2013-2016) was the largest in history, with 28,000 cases and 11,000 deaths 2 . EBOV has a striking, filamentous structure: the helical nucleocapsid acquires an envelope by budding from the plasma membrane, a process driven by the VP40 matrix protein. The viral envelope contains spikes consisting of the glycoprotein (GP) trimer 3-5 . This GP molecule achieves the combined functions of attachment to host cells, endosomal entry, and membrane fusion 6-12 . In the current study, we present the structure of the surface glycoprotein (GP) spike at 11  resolution, in situ within the viral plasma membrane, determined by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). As a class I fusion protein, EBOV GP plays key roles in cellular attachment, and entry of the virus into host cells, and is a key target for immune and therapeutic approaches 13-18 . There is extensive glycosylation, particularly in the mucin-like domain. The GP is cleaved into two disulfide-linked proteins, GP1 and GP2: GP1 contains the receptor binding and mucin-like domains. The endosomal receptor for GP is the Nieman-Pick disease type C1 (NPC-1)protein 10, 19 . Cathepsin cleavage of GP in the endsome is necessary for exposure of the NPC-1 binding site and subsequent fusion: binding to the receptor is thought to trigger fusion 13, 14, 17, [20] [21] [22] . GP2 is bound to the viral envelope by the transmembrane domain and contains the fusion peptide which achieves membrane fusion [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . Recently an unliganded X-ray crystallography structure of the EBOV GP was determined 14 . The latter is the largest and most detailed structure of the EBOV GP described so far, however certain domains are still missing, due to the need to truncate the transmembrane and certain glycosylation sites in order to achieve crystallization. We have docked these new atomic resolution structures within our 11  cryo-EM structure of the entire EBOV GP trimer imaged in the viral membrane, to generate a variable resolution structural map of the entire integral-membrane spike.

3|chunk|EBOV has a single-stranded negative-sense 19 kb RNA genome encoding eight structural proteins, including the nucleoprotein (NP), virion proteins (VP24, VP30, VP35, and VP40), polymerase protein (L), the transmembrane glycoprotein (GP) and a soluble glycoprotein (sGP) 1 . The GP spike is the only surface protein in EBOVs, unlike some other enveloped viruses, for example paramyxoviruses, which have separate proteins that perform the viral attachment and fusion functions. In EBOV the GP is solely responsible for both of these functions and the presence of a single species of spike molecule simplifies analysis by cryo-electron microscopy and image processing. Previous structural investigations of the entire GP trimer have relied upon recombinant expression of
