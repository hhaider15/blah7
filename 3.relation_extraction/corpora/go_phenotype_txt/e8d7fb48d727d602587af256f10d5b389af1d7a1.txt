1|chunk|The synthesis of novel pyrazolylnucleosides 3a-e, 4a-e, 5a-e, and 6a-e are described. The structures of the regioisomers were elucidated by using extensive NMR studies. The pyrazolylnucleosides 5a-e and 6a-e were screened for anticancer activities on sixty human tumor cell lines. The compound 6e showed good activity against 39 cancer cell lines. In particular, it showed significant inhibition against the lung cancer cell line Hop-92 (GI 50 9.3 M) and breast cancer cell line HS 578T (GI 50 3.0 M).

2|chunk|Molecules 2019, 24, 3922 2 of 16 conformation have been used to reach a particular conformation of a rotamer to study the affinity of a biomacromolecule for its natural ligand as well as the molecular recognition in an oligonucleotide chain (RNA/DNA) [12] [13] [14] [15] . Similar studies of anti-sense and anti-gene oligonucleotides (ONs) as potential and selective inhibitors of gene expression [16] [17] [18] [19] and their use as anti-tumor or anti-viral agents [20] [21] [22] [23] have also influenced the developments in the field of nucleic acid-based drugs. Among the nucleoside analogues with significant biological activities, dideoxynucleoside-based compounds such as 2 ,3 -dideoxycytidine (ddC) [24], 2 ,3 -dideoxyinosine (ddI) [24] , and 3 -azidothymidine (AZT) [25] are effective therapeutic agents for the treatment of AIDS, while ribavirin (virazole) [26, 27] is an antiviral drug (Figure 1) . Similarly, other dideoxynucleosides such as d4T (2 ,3 -didehydro-3 -deoxythymidine, stavudine) [28, 29] and AZddU (3 -azido-2 ,3 -dideoxyuridine) [30] have gone through clinical studies. Different nucleosides isolated from nature such as oxazinomycin [31], pyrazofurin [32,33], showdomycin [34, 35] , formycin A, and formycin B [36, 37] have shown antibiotic properties and have also been found to exhibit anticancer and/or antiviral activities (Figure 1) . These examples and new developments in the chemistry and biology of these compounds and their analogs [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] have motivated us to work in this area and have led us to investigate the interesting chemical and biological properties of novel nucleoside-based compounds.
