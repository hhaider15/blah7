2|chunk|The title compound, C 23 H 25 BrN 2 O 3 , crystallizes with two independent molecules in the asymmetric unit (Z 0 = 2) which differ in the twist of the 5-bromo-1H-indole ring with respect to the plane of the 4-methyl-1,4,5,6,7,8-hexahydroquinoline ring [dihedral angles of 78.55 (9) and 89.70 (8) in molecules A and B, respectively]. The indole ring is planar in both molecules [maximum deviations = 0.021 (3) and 0.020 (3)  for the N atom] while the cyclohexene ring has adopts a sofa conformation. In the crystal, molecules are linked by pairs of N-H  O hydrogen bonds, forming dimers with R 1 2 (6) ring motifs. These dimers are connected by N-H  O hydrogen bonds, generating chains along [110]. A C-H  O contact occurs between the independent molecules.
