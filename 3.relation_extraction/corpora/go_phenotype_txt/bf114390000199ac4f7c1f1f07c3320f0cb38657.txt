1|chunk|Africa in 2014 through sequential immunization of Chinese rhesus macaques and antigen-specific single B cell sorting. These mAbs demonstrated potent neutralizing activities against both pseudo and live Ebola virus independent of complement. Biochemical, single particle EM, and mutagenesis analysis suggested Q206 and Q411 recognized novel epitopes in the head while Q314 targeted the glycan cap in the GP1 subunit. Q206 and Q411 appeared to influence GP binding to its receptor NPC1. Treatment with these mAbs provided partial but significant protection against disease in a mouse model of Ebola virus infection. These novel mAbs could serve as promising candidates for prophylactic and therapeutic interventions against Ebola virus infection.

2|chunk|Ebolavirus is the etiologic agent of lethal hemorrhagic fever in humans and nonhuman primates. Since its discovery in 1976, Ebolavirus has caused frequent outbreaks across Central Africa with exceedingly high mortality rate up to 90% 1,2 . While the natural host is currently unknown, Ebolavirus has been exploring more species as hosts across broader geographic frontiers 3-5 . Most notable was the unprecedented outbreak in West Africa in 2014 where the number of affected people has surpassed all the previously recorded cases combined 1 , raising the concerns about its pandemic potential and posing a serious threat to global health. Genetically, Ebolavirus isolated so far represents a divergent and evolving cluster and can be broadly classified into 5 species: Zaire (EBOV), Sudan (SUDV), Bundibugyo (BDBV), Reston (RESTV), and Tai Forest (TAFV) viruses 6 . Multiple lineages of EBOV were identified with increasing phylogenetic and genetic diversity in the 2014 outbreak in West Africa 7-12 . While it is uncertain whether the observed genetic diversity is the cause or the consequence of the current epidemic, the high mortality rate associated with rapid human to human transmission strongly argue for more effective therapeutics and vaccines against EBOV infection.

3|chunk|The surface glycoprotein (GP) of EBOV mediates viral entry and serves as the main target for antibody-based therapy and vaccination. Once translated inside the target cell, GP is cleaved by furin to yield disulphide-linked GP1 and GP2 subunits that further assemble into metastable trimers 13 . The GP1 subunit is responsible for cellular attachment and binding to the receptor Niemann Pick C1 (NPC1), whereas GP2 mediates fusion of the viral and cellular membranes 13 . Three GP1 subunits forms a chalice consisting of the receptor binding domains (RBD), the
