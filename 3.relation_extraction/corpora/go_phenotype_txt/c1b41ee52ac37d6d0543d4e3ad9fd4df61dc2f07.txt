1|chunk|Inflammatory airway disease, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), is a major health burden worldwide. These diseases cause large numbers of deaths each year due to airway obstruction, which is exacerbated by respiratory viral infection. The inflammatory response in the airway is mediated in part through the MAPK pathways: p38, JNK and ERK. These pathways also have roles in interferon production, viral replication, mucus production, and T cell responses, all of which are important processes in inflammatory airway disease. Dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs) are known to regulate the MAPKs, and roles for this family of proteins in the pathogenesis of airway disease are emerging. This review summarizes the function of DUSPs in regulation of cytokine expression, mucin production, and viral replication in the airway. The central role of DUSPs in T cell responses, including T cell activation, differentiation, and proliferation, will also be highlighted. In addition, the importance of this protein family in the lung, and the necessity of further investigation into their roles in airway disease, will be discussed.

2|chunk|These responses are aberrant in patients with underlying airway disease. The reasons for this remain incompletely understood, but involve impaired control of viral infection [15, 16] , damaged epithelium [17, 18] , and altered lymphocyte responses [19, 20] . This review will discuss the roles of the MAPK pathways in these processes and their regulation by a group of proteins known as dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs) or MAPK phosphatases (MKPs).

3|chunk|Activation of PRRs in respiratory epithelial cells leads to induction of the MAPK pathways, as summarized in Figure 1 [21] . Respiratory viral infection of epithelial cells can also activate the MAPKs through other means; for example, p38 can be activated by infection with rhinovirus, through the protein kinase Syk [22] [23] [24] , or influenza, through the endoplasmic-reticulum stress response [25] . Once activated, the MAPKs have roles in many different processes, with severe implications in airway disease. These roles are summarized in the following sections. Int. J. Mol.

6|chunk|PRRs detect viral infection of the cell: TLRs 2 and 4 can bind components of the viral surface, TLR3 binds dsRNA, TLR7/8 bind ssRNA, and the RLRs bind dsRNA or 5-triphosphorylated ssRNA. Adaptor proteins MyD88, TRIF, and MAVS mediate the activation of signaling pathways, including the MAPK pathways. The MAPKs translocate into the nucleus where they activate transcription factors, leading to the transcription of genes for inflammatory cytokines. TRIF and MAVS signaling activates IRF3, leading to interferon production. The MAPK pathways can also activate IRF3. Inflammatory cytokines and interferons are released by the cell and act upon surrounding cells. IFN binds to the IFN receptor complex IFNAR1/2, activating the JAK/STAT pathway. JAK1 and Tyk2 phosphorylate STAT1 and STAT2 which dimerize, translocate to the nucleus and bind IRF9, forming ISGF3, which induces transcription of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs).
