1|chunk|The full-length genome sequence of a variant porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) strain, CH/GDZQ/2014, was determined. The isolate was a variant strain with a relatively far relationship with the PEDV strains previously identified in the same area between 2011 and 2012 and was genetically distinct from the CV777-based vaccine strain currently being used in China.
