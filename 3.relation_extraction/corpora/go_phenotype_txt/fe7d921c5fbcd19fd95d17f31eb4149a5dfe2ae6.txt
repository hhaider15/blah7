0|chunk|The relationship of serum vitamins A, D, E and LL-37 levels with allergic status, tonsillar virus detection and immune response

1|chunk|Tonsils have an active role in immune defence and inducing and maintaining tolerance to allergens. Vitamins A, D, and E, and antimicrobial peptide LL-37 may have immunomodulatory effects. We studied how their serum levels were associated with allergy status, intratonsillar/nasopharyngeal virus detection and intratonsillar expression of T cell-and innate immune response-specific cytokines, transcription factors and type I/II/III interferons in patients undergoing tonsillectomy.

2|chunk|110 elective tonsillectomy patients participated. Serum levels of vitamins A, 25(OH)D, and E, LL-37 and allergen-specific IgE as well as nasopharyngeal/intratonsillar respiratory viruses were analyzed. The mRNA expression of IFN-, IFN-, IFN-, IL-10, IL-13, IL-17, IL-28, IL-29, IL-37, TGF-, FOXP3, GATA3, RORC2 and Tbet in tonsils were analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR.

3|chunk|The median age of the patients was 16 years (range 3-60), 28% of subjects had atopy, and 57% carried !1 respiratory virus in nasopharynx. Detection of viruses decreased by age. Higher vitamin A levels showed borderline significance with less viral detection (P = 0.056). Higher 25(OH)D was associated with less allergic rhinitis and atopy (P < 0.05) and higher vitamin E with less self-reported allergy (P < 0.05). In gene expression analyses, 25(OH)D
