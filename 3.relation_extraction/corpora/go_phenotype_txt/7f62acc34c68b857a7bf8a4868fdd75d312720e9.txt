0	37	42 Acute	Phenotype	HP_0011009

1|chunk|Background: Better understanding the etiology-specific incidence of severe acute respiratory infections (SARIs) in resourcepoor, rural settings will help further develop and prioritize prevention strategies. To address this gap in knowledge, we conducted a longitudinal study to estimate the incidence of SARIs among children in rural Bangladesh.
1	68	74 severe	Phenotype	HP_0012828
1	75	80 acute	Phenotype	HP_0011009
1	81	103 respiratory infections	Phenotype	HP_0011947

2|chunk|Methods: During June through October 2010, we followed children aged ,5 years in 67 villages to identify those with cough, difficulty breathing, age-specific tachypnea and/or danger signs in the community or admitted to the local hospital.

3|chunk|A study physician collected clinical information and obtained nasopharyngeal swabs from all SARI cases and blood for bacterial culture from those hospitalized. We tested swabs for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza viruses, human metapneumoviruses, adenoviruses and human parainfluenza viruses 1-3 (HPIV) by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. We calculated virus-specific SARI incidence by dividing the number of new illnesses by the person-time each child contributed to the study.
