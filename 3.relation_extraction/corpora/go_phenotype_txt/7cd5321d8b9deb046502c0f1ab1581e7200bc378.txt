1|chunk|Background: DNA vaccine immunogenicity has been limited by inefficient delivery. Needle-free delivery of DNA using a CO 2 -powered BiojectorH device was compared to delivery by needle and syringe and evaluated for safety and immunogenicity.

2|chunk|Methods: Forty adults, 18-50 years, were randomly assigned to intramuscular (IM) vaccinations with DNA vaccine, VRC-HIVDNA016-00-VP, (weeks 0, 4, 8) by BiojectorH 2000 TM or needle and syringe (N/S) and boosted IM at week 24 with VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP (rAd5) with N/S at 10 10 or 10 11 particle units (PU). Equal numbers per assigned schedule had low (#500) or high (.500) reciprocal titers of preexisting Ad5 neutralizing antibody.

3|chunk|Results: 120 DNA and 39 rAd5 injections were given; 36 subjects completed follow-up research sample collections. IFN-c ELISpot response rates were 17/19 (89%) for BiojectorH and 13/17 (76%) for N/S delivery at Week 28 (4 weeks post rAd5 boost). The magnitude of ELISpot response was about 3-fold higher in BiojectorH compared to N/S groups. Similar effects on response rates and magnitude were observed for CD8+, but not CD4+ T-cell responses by ICS. Env-specific antibody responses were about 10-fold higher in Biojector-primed subjects.

4|chunk|Conclusions: DNA vaccination by BiojectorH was well-tolerated and compared to needle injection, primed for greater IFN-c ELISpot, CD8+ T-cell, and antibody responses after rAd5 boosting.
