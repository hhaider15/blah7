1|chunk|Positive-strand (+)RNA viruses are important and emerging pathogens of humans, animals, and plants. Upon infection, they induce the formation of specialized membranous replication organelles with unique lipid composition to facilitate robust virus replication. In this article, the authors discuss the proviral role of virus-induced membrane contact sites (vMCSs). The emerging picture is that vMCSs channel lipids to viral membranes and tune the lipid composition for optimal generation and functioning of replication organelles.
