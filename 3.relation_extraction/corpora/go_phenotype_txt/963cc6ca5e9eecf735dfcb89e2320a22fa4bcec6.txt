1|chunk|Sow's milk is a potential route for the vertical transmission of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) from sow to suckling piglet. We report here the complete genome sequence of PEDV strain CH/HNYF/2014, which was isolated from milk samples. This information provides further understanding of the transmission mechanisms and genetic diversity of PEDV.
