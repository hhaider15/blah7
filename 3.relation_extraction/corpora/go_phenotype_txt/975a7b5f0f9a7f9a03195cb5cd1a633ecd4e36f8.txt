1|chunk|Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) is a member of the genus Cardiovirus in the Picornaviridae, a family of positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses. Previously, we demonstrated that in the related cardiovirus, Encephalomyocarditis virus, a programmed 1 ribosomal frameshift (1 PRF) occurs at a conserved G_GUU_UUU sequence within the 2B-encoding region of the polyprotein open reading frame (ORF). Here we show that 1 PRF occurs at a similar site during translation of the TMEV genome. In addition, we demonstrate that a predicted 3= RNA stem-loop structure at a noncanonical spacing downstream of the shift site is required for efficient frameshifting in TMEV and that frameshifting also requires virus infection. Mutating the G_GUU_UUU shift site to inhibit frameshifting results in an attenuated virus with reduced growth kinetics and a small-plaque phenotype. Frameshifting in the virus context was found to be extremely efficient at 74 to 82%, which, to our knowledge, is the highest frameshifting efficiency recorded to date for any virus. We propose that highly efficient 1 PRF in TMEV provides a mechanism to escape the confines of equimolar expression normally inherent in the single-polyprotein expression strategy of picornaviruses.

2|chunk|Many viruses utilize programmed 1 ribosomal frameshifting (1 PRF) to produce different protein products at a defined ratio, or to translate overlapping ORFs to increase coding capacity. With few exceptions, 1 PRF occurs on specific "slippery" heptanucleotide sequences and is stimulated by RNA structure beginning 5 to 9 nucleotides (nt) downstream of the slippery site. Here we describe an unusual case of 1 PRF in Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) that is extraordinarily efficient (74 to 82% of ribosomes shift into the alternative reading frame) and, in stark contrast to other examples of 1 PRF, is dependent upon a stem-loop structure beginning 14 nt downstream of the slippery site. Furthermore, in TMEV-based reporter constructs in transfected cells, efficient frameshifting is critically dependent upon virus infection. We suggest that TMEV evolved frameshifting as a novel mechanism for removing ribosomes from the message (a "ribosome sink") to downregulate synthesis of the 3=-encoded replication proteins.
