1|chunk|Pulmonary exacerbations are common events in cystic fibrosis and have a profound impact on quality of life, morbidity, and mortality. Pulmonary exacerbation outcomes remain poor and a significant proportion of patients fail to recover their baseline lung function despite receiving aggressive treatment with intravenous antibiotics. This focused review provides an update on some of the recent advances that have taken place in our understanding of the epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of pulmonary exacerbations in cystic fibrosis as well as direction for future study.
