1|chunk|We report the first complete genome sequence of a feline astrovirus (FAstV), FAstV2 strain 1637F, identified from a domestic cat. The genome is 6,779 nucleotides (nt) in length and consists of three overlapping open reading frames (ORF1a-ORF1b-ORF2). Sequence analysis suggests that FAstV2 represents a new FAstV genotype that is closely related to human astroviruses.
