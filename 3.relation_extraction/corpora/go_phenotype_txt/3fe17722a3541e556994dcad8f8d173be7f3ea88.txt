0|chunk|Comparative Analysis of Transcriptional Profiles of Adult Schistosoma japonicum from Different Laboratory Animals and the Natural Host, Water Buffalo

1|chunk|Schistosomiasis is one of the most widely distributed parasitic diseases in the world. Schistosoma japonicum, a zoonotic parasite with a wide range of mammalian hosts, is one of the major pathogens of this disease. Although numerous studies on schistosomiasis japonica have been performed using laboratory animal models, systematic comparative analysis of whole-genome expression profiles in parasites from different laboratory animals and nature mammalian hosts is lacking to date.

2|chunk|Adult schistosomes were obtained from laboratory animals BALB/c mice, C57BL/6 mice, New Zealand white rabbits and the natural host, water buffaloes. The gene expression profiles of schistosomes from these animals were obtained and compared by genome-wide oligonucleotide microarray analysis. The results revealed that the gene expression profiles of schistosomes from different laboratory animals and buffaloes were highly consistent (r>0.98) genome-wide. Meanwhile, a total of 450 genes were identified to be differentially expressed in schistosomes which can be clustered into six groups. Pathway analysis revealed that these genes were mainly involved in multiple signal transduction pathways, amino acid, energy, nucleotide and lipid metabolism. We also identified a group of 1,540 abundantly and stably expressed gene products in adult worms, including a panel of 179 Schistosomaor Platyhelminthes-specific genes that may be essential for parasitism and may be regarded as novel potential anti-parasite intervention targets for future research.

3|chunk|This study provides a comprehensive database of gene expression profiles of schistosomes derived from different laboratory animals and water buffaloes. An expanded number of genes potentially affecting the development of schistosomes in different animals were identified. These findings lay the foundation for schistosomiasis research in different laboratory animals and natural hosts at the transcriptional level and provide a valuable resource for screening anti-schistosomal intervention targets.

4|chunk|The zoonotic parasite Schistosoma japonicum is one of the major pathogens of schistosomiasis and can parasitize a wide range of mammals. Although numerous schistosome transcriptional profiling studies have been performed using laboratory animal models, the differences in the global gene expression profiles of worms from different laboratory animals and natural mammalian hosts have not been characterized. Therefore, we studied the gene expression profiles of adult worms from BALB/c mice, C57BL/6 mice, rabbits and buffaloes using a transcriptomics approach. Our results indicate that, although the expression profiles of adult worms from different mammals are generally similar, hundreds of genes are differentially expressed, which were mainly involved in various signal transduction pathways, amino acid, energy, nucleotide and lipid metabolism. Numerous abundantly and stably expressed genes in adults were identified, including some genes that are only found in blood flukes or expanded within the phylum Platyhelminthes and may be important for parasitism. Our data provide a basis for schistosomiasis research in different mammalian hosts at the transcriptional level as well as a valuable resource for the screening of anti-schistosomal intervention targets.
