1|chunk|A new variant of the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is an emerging swine disease, killing considerable numbers of neonatal piglets in North America and Asia in recent years. To generate immunogens mimicking the complex spike (S) protein folding with proper posttranslational modification to mount a robust immune response against the highly virulent PEDV, two baculoviruses displaying the full-length S protein (S-Bac) and the S1 protein (S1-Bac) of the virulent Taiwan genotype 2b (G2b) PEDV Pintung 52 (PEDV-PT) strain were constructed. Intramuscular immunizations of mice and piglets with the S-Bac and S1-Bac demonstrated significantly higher levels of systemic anti-PEDV S-specific IgG, as compared with control group. Our results also showed that piglets in the S-Bac group elicited superior PEDV-specific neutralizing antibodies than those of the S1-Bac and control groups. The highly virulent PEDV-PT strain challenge experiment showed that piglets immunized with S-Bac and S1-Bac showed milder clinical symptoms with significantly less fecal viral shedding as compared with non-immunized control piglets. More importantly, piglets immunized with the S-Bac exhibited no to mild clinical signs, with a delayed, minimal viral shedding. Our results demonstrated that the S-Bac could serve as a safe, easy to manipulate, and effective vaccine candidate against the PEDV infection.

3|chunk|Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus belongs to family Coronaviridae, subfamily Coronavirinae and genus Alphacoronavirus [1] . The virus has a single, 28 kb, positive strain RNA genome encoding seven open reading frames (ORF): the ORF1a and ORF1b genes encode the replicase; the ORF3 gene encodes the accessory protein; the ORF2, ORF4, ORF5, and ORF6 genes encode four structural proteins, namely spike (S), envelope (E), nucleocapsid (N), and membrane (M) protein [11] . Among the structure proteins, the S protein, which is responsible for virus-host recognition, virus internalization, and neutralizing antibody induction, is the principle antigenic determinant [1]. The naturally assembled S protein forms a homotrimeric structure with several predicted glycosylation sites [12] . This glycoprotein can further be divided into S1 and S2 domains by specific cleavage site [13] . The S1 domain contributes to receptor recognition, enteropathogenicity, and immunogenicity, as it contains the dominant neutralizing epitopes, thus being the main target for vaccine development [14, 15] . Linking with the S1, the S2 domain anchors on the viral membrane and triggers membrane fusion [16] . Several neutralizing epitopes on the S protein of PEDV have been described, including the CO-26K-equivalent epitope (COE epitope) [15], the antigen epitope motif recognized by monoclonal antibody 2C10 at C terminal end of S protein [17, 18] , and the S1D domain [19] . Therefore, S protein is considered a major target for PEDV vaccine development [9, 20] . The baculovirus expressing system has long been utilized for different biological purposes, for instance, recombinant protein production [21], vaccine manufacturing, and gene therapy [22, 23] . Among various strains, Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) is the most popular strain for laboratory applications. The high protein productivity, large capacity and flexibility to accommodate long insertions [24], high biosafety for vertebrates, and delicate post-translation modifications are the advantages of the baculovirus expressing system [25] . Furthermore, as a vaccine candidate, the viral particle of baculovirus is able to evoke robust innate immune responses by regulating cytokines [26], as well as serving an adjuvant role in promoting B cell and T cell activation to improve the humoral immune responses [27] . Baculovirus is a very stable DNA virus, which can be stored at 4  C for up to 4 years without significant change in virus titers [28] . Also, this virus is easy to propagate, with high titers around 10 8 -10 9 TCID50/mL. Recently, baculovirus-expressing viral surface proteins has become a novel strategy for recreating complex protein folding and functional properties [29, 30] . Given that baculovirus is able to mount a robust immune response [26, 31] , the baculovirus displaying a heterologous protein on its surface could be a novel tool for the development of new generation of vaccines. In this context, several immunogens have been generated using the baculovirus display strategy and proven to be able to induce strong humoral immunity and protection against infectious diseases [32] [33] [34] .

The immunogenicities of S-Bac and S1-Bac were compared and evaluated in mice and pigs by intramuscular (IM) injections without cooperating with adjuvants. The protective efficacy that these baculovirus display vaccines against the highly virulent PEDV-PT strain were also evaluated.
