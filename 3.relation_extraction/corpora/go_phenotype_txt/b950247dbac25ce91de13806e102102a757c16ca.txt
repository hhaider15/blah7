1|chunk|of the virus per se and cellular NF-B activity; and (ii) to study the underling mechanisms. We found that tylophorine-based compounds target the TGEV viral RNA and effectively inhibit TGEV replication. NF-B inhibition also leads to anti-TGEV replication. NF-B activation induced by TGEV infection was found to be associated with two convergent pathways, IKK-2_IB/p65 and JAK2 mediated p65 phosphorylation, in swine testicular cells. JAK2 inhibition either by CYT387 (a JAK family inhibitor) or by silencing JAK2-expression revealed a dominant JAK2 mediated p65 phosphorylation pathway for NF-B activation and resulted in NF-B inhibition, which overrode the IB regulation via the IKK-2. Finally, tylophorine-based compounds work cooperatively with CYT387 to impart comprehensive anti-TGEV activities. The combination treatment, wherein a tylophorine compound targets TGEV and a JAK2 inhibitor blocks the alternative dominant NF-B activation mediated by JAK2, is more effective and comprehensive than either one alone and constitutes a feasible approach for the treatment of SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.

Since the 2003 SARS outbreak (which had a mortality rate of ~10%), novel anti-SARS-CoV treatments have been vigorously pursued. No new cases of SARS have been reported since the 2003 outbreak, but another novel coronavirus (MERS-CoV), this time with a mortality rate of ~35%, came to light in 2012 4 . To date, neither a commercially available vaccine for human coronaviruses nor a specific treatment for SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV is available.

3|chunk|Coronaviruses primarily infect the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tract and induce host inflammation 5 . Nuclear factor B (NF-B) activation by coronaviruses is usually responsible for mediating the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and thus plays an important role in the pathogenesis of disease caused by coronaviruses 6, 7 . Inhibition of NF-B-mediated inflammation induced by coronavirus in mice was reported to increase the survival rate 6 . Thus, NF-B inhibitors constitute a promising class of antivirals in infections caused by pathogenic coronaviruses. However, targeting NF-B is limited by intrinsic pathway complexity, cross talk with other pathways, and drug resistance 8 . In addition, many small chemical molecules targeting either viral entry or the intracellular viral life cycle were reported to impart anti-coronavirus activity 2, 9, 10 . Despite these advances, however, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV remain untreatable diseases for which novel therapies are sought.

NF-B is significantly activated after infection by coronaviruses, e.g. TGEV, and MHV etc 6, 7, [13] [14] [15] . Otherwise, coronaviral nucleocapsid (N) protein plays a vital role in the regulation of viral genome replication and host gene transcription 16 . Therefore, the combination treatment for the inhibition of coronavirus per se, e.g. viral genome replication, and blocking cellular NF-B activation by coronaviruses, is a promising approach for the development of anti-coronavirals.

Herein, we report: (1) tylophorine-based compounds exert potent anti-TGEV replication by directly targeting the viral RNA/ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex for viral replication/synthesis; (2) NF-B inhibition also leads to anti-TGEV replication; (3) A combination treatment consisting of both a tylophorine compound and an NF-B inhibitor acts additively or synergically to more effectively and comprehensively inhibit TGEV replication than either (1) or (2) alone.
