1|chunk|Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a chronic liver disease found worldwide. The present study aimed to evaluate the mechanisms of inhibiting lipid accumulation in free fatty acid (FFA)-treated HepG2 cells caused by bark and fruit extracts of Toona sinensis (TSB and TSF). FFA induced lipid and triglyceride (TG) accumulation, which was attenuated by TSB and TSF. TSB and/or TSF promoted phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and acetyl-coA carboxylase and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha upregulation. Furthermore, TSB and TSF suppressed FFA-induced liver X receptor, sterol regulatory element-binding transcription protein 1, fatty acid synthase, and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 protein expression. Moreover, TSB and/or TSF induced phosphorylation of Unc-51 like autophagy-activating kinase and microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 expressions. Therefore, TSB and TSF relieve lipid accumulation by attenuating lipogenic protein expression, activating the AMPK pathway, and upregulating the autophagic flux to enhance lipid metabolism. Moreover, TSB and TSF reduced TG contents, implying the therapeutic use of TSB and TSF in NAFLD. by specific transport proteins and undergoes -oxidation [5] [6] [7] [8] . Hyperinsulinemia directly inhibits -oxidation of FFA, promoting hepatic de novo lipid synthesis through upregulation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) and carbohydrate response element-binding protein [5] [6] [7] [8] .

3|chunk|Emerging evidence suggests that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR) and LC3 are critical regulators of hepatic lipid metabolism and could be therapeutic targets in NAFLD [10]. These target proteins exhibit interactions; for example, phosphorylation of Thr172 in the -subunit of AMPK activates acetyl-coA carboxylase (ACC)-SREBP-1c, PPAR, and Unc-51-like autophagy activating kinase (ULK1)-LC3 [11, 12] .

4|chunk|Toona sinensis (A. Juss.) M. Roem., a deciduous tree, is widely distributed in Southeast Asia and cultivated in many parts of the world [13] . The whole plant can be used in herbal remedies, and its tender leaves have been used in dishes or sauces for several years [13] . Until now, hundreds of phytochemical compounds have been identified in T. sinensis, including polyphenols (phenolic acid, flavonoids, stilbene, and lignan), terpenoids, and sterols [14] . It was reported that aqueous extract of leaves of T. sinensis (TSL-1) exhibits many biological functions, such as antiviral [15,16], antibacterial [17], antidiabetic [18], anti-obesity [19], hepatoprotective [20, 21] , and anti-cancer [22] [23] [24] functions. However, little is known about other parts of T. sinensis. Our preliminary results demonstrated that, among the root, leaves, bark, and fruit of T. sinensis, the bark and fruit could block lipid accumulation in hepatocytes. It has been shown that a diet with T. sinensis leaves, root, or bark (TSB) enhances sperm quality and improves memory in senescence-accelerated prone-8 mice [25] . T. sinensis fruit (TSF) extract exhibits strong antioxidative effects and protects the kidney from diabetic nephropathy [26] . The present study investigated the molecular mechanism of the effects of TSB and TSF extracts on lipid accumulation using an in vitro cellular model.
