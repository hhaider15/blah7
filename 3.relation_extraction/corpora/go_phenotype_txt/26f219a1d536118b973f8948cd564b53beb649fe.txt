1|chunk|Since 2012, our understanding of human papillomavirus (HPV) subcellular trafficking has undergone a drastic paradigm shift. Work from multiple laboratories has revealed that HPV has evolved a unique means to deliver its viral genome (vDNA) to the cell nucleus, relying on myriad host cell proteins and processes. The major breakthrough finding from these recent endeavors has been the realization of L2-dependent utilization of cellular sorting factors for the retrograde transport of vDNA away from degradative endo/lysosomal compartments to the Golgi, prior to mitosis-dependent nuclear accumulation of L2/vDNA. An overview of current models of HPV entry, subcellular trafficking, and the role of L2 during initial infection is provided below, highlighting unresolved questions and gaps in knowledge.

Although many studies have reported in vitro DNA-binding activity for the conserved, positively charged Nand C-termini of L2 [12] [13] [14] [15] , the structural nature of the L2/vDNA complex within the actual virion remains poorly understood. This review focuses on the remarkable actions of the L2 protein ( Figure 1 ) and the molecular mechanisms and cellular pathways of subcellular trafficking of the L2/vDNA subviral complex. Recent progress will be summarized and outstanding questions and inconsistencies will be highlighted. Viruses 2017, 9, 370 2 of 18 individual L2 molecules can likely assume different conformations or configurations within the virion, although this has yet to be proven.
