1|chunk|Interferon-lambda (IFN-) is a recently described cytokine found to be of critical importance in innate immune regulation of intestinal viruses. Endogenous IFN- has potent antiviral effects and has been shown to control multiple intestinal viruses and may represent a factor that contributes to human variability in response to infection. Importantly, recombinant IFN- has therapeutic potential against enteric viral infections, many of which lack other effective treatments. In this mini-review, we describe recent advances regarding IFN--mediated regulation of enteric viruses with important clinical relevance including rotavirus, reovirus, and norovirus. We also briefly discuss IFN- interactions with other cytokines important in the intestine, and how IFN- may play a role in regulation of intestinal viruses by the commensal microbiome. Finally, we indicate currently outstanding questions regarding IFN- control of enteric infections that remain to be explored to enhance our understanding of this important immune molecule.
