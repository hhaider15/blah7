1|chunk|We studied whether the aqueous extract of Schizonepeta tenuifolia Briq (STE) has antiviral activity. STE inhibited replication of EV71, as evident by its ability to diminish plaque formation and cytopathic effect induced by EV71, and to inhibit the synthesis of viral RNA and protein. Moreover, daily singledose STE treatment significantly improved the survival of EV71-infected mice, and ameliorated the symptoms. Mechanistically, STE exerts multiple effects on enteroviral infection. Treatment with STE reduced viral attachment and entry; the cleavage of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4 G (eIF4G) by EV71 protease, 2A pro ; virus-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation; and relocation of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1) from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. It was accompanied by a decline in EV71-associated hyperphosphorylation of p38 kinase and EPS15. It is plausible that STE may inhibit ROS-induced p38 kinase activation, and subsequent hnRNP A1 relocation and EPS15-mediated membrane trafficking in infected cells. These findings suggest that STE possesses anti-EV71 activities, and may serve as health food or candidate antiviral drug for protection against EV71.

2|chunk|Enterovirus 71 (EV71) is a non-enveloped, positive-sense single stranded RNA virus belonging to the family Picornaviridae, and is one of the major pathogens that causes hand, foot and mouth disease in young children, especially those under 5 years old 1 . EV71 transmits from person to person by direct contact saliva, nasal mucus, stool and blister of infected patients 2-4 . Most of EV71 infections are mild and self-limiting. These infected individuals have slight fever, herpangina, and rash on the mouth, hand and body. Some severe cases may progress to Published: xx xx xxxx OPEN www.nature.com/scientificreports/ 2 Scientific RepoRts | 7: 935 | develop aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, and polio-like symptoms. The central nervous system (CNS) infections can result in pulmonary edema, pulmonary hemorrhage and lung collapse 5-8 , which may be fatal to patients. The survivors of severe EV71 infections may have irreversible neural sequelae 9 . Three large outbreaks of EV71 have been recorded in recent decades. In 1998, 129,106 individuals were infected, and 78 fatal cases were reported in Taiwan 1 . EV71 caused 126 deaths in 2008 and 567 victims in 2012 in China 10, 11 . No antiviral drug is available for treating EV71 infection. Development of a specific anti-EV71 drug may improve the clinical outcomes in infected patients.

3|chunk|The RNA genome of EV71 encodes a large precursor polypeptide that is processed by viral protease to generate viral structural proteins (VP1, VP2, VP3, and VP4) and nonstructural proteins (2A, 2B, 2C, 3A, 3B, 3C, and 3D). After viral attachment to receptor, the virus is endocytosed via clathrin-coated vesicles, and uncoated to release the genomic RNA. Unlike cellular message RNA, the viral genomic RNA lacks the cap structure on 5 end to recruit ribosome and initiate protein translation. Its highly structured 5 untranslated region (UTR) contains internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) which interacts with IRES trans-acting factors (ITAFs) and facilitates the initiation of translation 12, 13 . Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1) is one member of ITAFs and is involved in the synthesis of viral genome and protein 14, 15 . EV71 infection induces the relocation of hnRNP A1 from nucleus to cytoplasm which may be beneficial to viral replication 14 . The viral protease, 2A pro , hydrolyzes eukaryotic initiation factor 4G (eIF4G) and poly(A) binding protein (PABP) that are essential for the cap-dependent translation [16] [17] [18] . The hydrolytic reactions cause the switch of cap-dependent translation to IRES-dependent translation. EV71 hijacks the host translation machinery to synthesize viral proteins 18 .

4|chunk|Accumulating evidence indicates that the redox state of host may play important roles in the viral pathogenesis. The susceptibility to viruses, such as dengue virus, enterovirus 71 or coronavirus, is related to redox state of host cells [19] [20] [21] [22] . Antioxidants are known to deter viral infection. For instance, glutathione and resveratrol inhibit influenza infection in cell and animal model 23, 24 . Treatment with synthetic antioxidants, such as mitoTEMPO and N-acetyl-cysteine, and natural antioxidants, such as epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and gallocatechin gallate (GCG), diminishes EV71 replication 20, 25, 26 . The antiviral capacity of tea polyphenols correlates with their antioxidant ability. These studies suggest that the redox state of host is an important determinant of viral susceptibility, and that the antioxidative capacity of herbal extract partly accounts for the antiviral activity.

5|chunk|Schizonepeta tenuifolia Briq. (ST), also called "Jing Jie" in China, is an annual plant belonging to the family Labiatae. In East Asia, the fresh stem and leaf of ST are usually used as ingredients in several food recipes, herbal tea, beneficial drinks, medicinal cuisine, and herbal remedy 27 . Spikes, stems and leaves of ST are sun-dried or carbonized before use medicinally. ST contains a number of bioactive constituents (Supplementary Table S1 ) 27-34 . ST is used to treat the common cold, headaches, fever, allergic dermatitis, skin rash, and inflammatory diseases 28 . An antiviral activity is associated with ST. ST has been used in formulation of yinqiao-decoction, which proved effective in reduction of hemagglutinin titer of virus in lung tissue of influenza virus-infected mice 35 . However, previous reports on the anti-enteroviral activity of ST extract are controversial. Hsu et al. showed that a 95% ethanolic extract of ST inhibits one out of four clinical isolated EV71 in a screen of anti-EV71 activity with Taiwanese folk medicinal plants. In contrast, Lin et al. showed that an aqueous extract of dried ST has no anti-EV71 activity among 22 antipyretic and toxin-eliminating traditional Chinese herbs 37 .

6|chunk|In the present study, we demonstrate an anti-EV71 activity of STE. STE inhibits cytopathic effect, plaque formation, and genomic RNA replication of EV71. Moreover, it alleviates the symptoms and enhances the survival of EV71-infected mice. Mechanistically, STE inhibits EV71-induced ROS generation and hnRNP A1 translocation; cleavage of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4G (eIF4G); and p38 kinase-mediated EPS 15 phosphorylation. Our findings suggest that STE exerts an antiviral activity against EV71 through its action on a number of targets.
