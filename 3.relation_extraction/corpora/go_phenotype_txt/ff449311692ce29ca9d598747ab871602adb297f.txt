To improve our understanding of the host responses to PRV infection, we applied isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) labeling coupled with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to quantitatively identify the differentially expressed cellular proteins in PRV-infected PK15 cells. In total, relative quantitative data were identified for 4333 proteins in PRV and mock-infected PK15 cells, among which 466 cellular proteins were differentially expressed, including 234 upregulated proteins and 232 downregulated proteins. Bioinformatics analysis disclosed that most of these differentially expressed proteins were involved in metabolic processes, cellular growth and proliferation, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response, cell adhesion and cytoskeleton. Moreover, expression levels of four representative proteins, beta-catenin, STAT1, GRB2 and PCNA, were further confirmed by western blot analysis. This is the first attempt to analyze the protein profile of PRV-infected PK15 cells using iTRAQ technology, and our findings may provide valuable information to help understand the host response to PRV infection.

2|chunk|known that porcine kidney epithelial cells (PK15) are most widely used for PRV isolation, propagation and basic research. In the present study, we used iTRAQ coupled with LC MS/MS to identify cellular proteins that were differentially expressed in PK15 cells infected with PRV. The results showed that 466 proteins were significantly changed after PRV infection. These proteins could serve as potential biomarkers of PRV-infected cells and provide new insights into the regulatory mechanism of this disease.

4|chunk|cells and the optimal time-point for proteomic analysis, PK-15 cells were infected with PRV and then monitored for CPE and viral protein expression, in addition to the viral titers, which were detected at 12, 24, 36 and 48 hpi. As shown in Fig. 1A , no obvious CPE was visible at 12 hpi; however, the CPE became readily apparent as the infection progressed. Obvious CPE was observed at 24 hpi and became significant at 36 and 48 hpi, including cell rounding, swelling, granular degeneration of the cytoplasm, cell detachment, and severely diseased cell morphology. The expression of PRV protein was monitored by IFA, and the results showed that almost all cells were infected at 24 hpi (Fig. 1B) . The one-step growth curve for PRV in PK-15 cells was also assessed. The viral titer peaked at 24 hpi and then gradually declined (Fig. 1C) . Generally, no excessive cytopathic effect of host cells was observed. The time point when viral replication remains high is often regarded as the optimal time for proteomic analysis 23,25 . Therefore, PRV-and mock-infected cells were harvested at 24 hpi for further proteomic analysis.

5|chunk|To explore the differentially expressed proteins following virus infection, the total proteins of PRV-infected and mock-infected PK15 cells were extracted for iTRAQ coupled with LC-MS/MS analysis. By this approach, a total of 4333 proteins were detected and quantified (Supplementary file 1). A quantitative ratio over 1.5 (fold change > 1.5 or < 0.67) and a p -value < 0.05 were considered differentially expressed proteins. Using the criterion, 234 proteins were significantly upregulated, and 232 proteins were downregulated during PRV infection (Supplementary file 2). Because the current pig genome is poorly annotated compared to the human genome database, there were 52 proteins that remained uncharacterized among the differentially expressed proteins (Supplementary file 2). Therefore, further research is warranted to focus on the functions of these proteins.
