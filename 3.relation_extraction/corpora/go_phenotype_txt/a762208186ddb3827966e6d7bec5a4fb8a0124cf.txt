1|chunk|Background: There is an urgent need to develop new innovative therapies for the control of advanced cancer. The combination of antigen-specific immunotherapy with the employment of immunomodulatory agents has emerged as a potentially plausible approach for the control of advanced cancer.

2|chunk|Methods: In the current study, we explored the combination of the DNA vaccine encoding calreticulin (CRT) linked to human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) E7 antigen (CRT/E7) with the TLR7 agonist imiquimod for their ability to generate E7-specific immune responses and antitumor effects in tumor-bearing mice.

3|chunk|We observed that treatment with CRT/E7 DNA in combination with imiquimod leads to an enhancement in the E7-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses and a decrease in the number of myeloid-derived suppressor cells in the tumor microenvironment of tumor-bearing mice. Furthermore, treatment with CRT/E7 DNA in combination with imiquimod leads to significantly improved antitumor effects and prolonged survival in treated mice. In addition, treatment with imiquimod led to increased number of NK1.1+ cells and F4/80+ cells in the tumor microenvironment. Macrophages and NK1.1+ cells were found to play an important role in the antitumor effects mediated by treatment with CRT/E7 DNA in combination with imiquimod.
