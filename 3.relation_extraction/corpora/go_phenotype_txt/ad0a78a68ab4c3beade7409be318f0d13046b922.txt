1|chunk|Ubiquitin-specific protease 2 (USP2) belongs to the family of deubiquitinases that can rescue protein targets from proteasomal degradation by reversing their ubiquitination. In various cancers, including prostate cancer and ovarian carcinoma, upregulation of USP2 leads to an increase in the levels of deubiquitinated substrates such as fatty acid synthase, MDM2, cyclin D1 and Aurora-A. USP2 thus plays a critical role in tumor cells' survival and therefore represents a therapeutic target. Here a leukemia drug, 6-thioguanine, was found to be a potent inhibitor of USP2. Enzyme-kinetic and X-ray crystallographic data suggest that 6-thioguanine displays a noncompetitive and slow-binding inhibitory mechanism against USP2. Our study provides a clear rationale for the clinical evaluation of 6-thioguanine for USP2-upregulated cancers.

2|chunk|Ubiquitination, a kind of post-translational modification, as well as deubiquitination, which together comprise the ubiquitination system, can regulate not only the turnover of cellular proteins but also, through various modes of mono-or polyubiquitination, receptor trafficking, DNA repair, cell-cycle progression, immune response, autophagy and apoptosis 1 . This versatility has raised interest in pinpointing components of the ubiquitin system as prime candidates for drug targets 2 . Among them, the pursuit of deubiquitinases (DUBs) as pharmaceutical targets is still in its infancy in that few inhibitors have entered clinical trials, albeit some broad-spectrum inhibitors have been patented and highly selective inhibitors have been developed 3-6 . The human genome encodes about 80-90 DUBs, of which the largest of the five DUB families is the ubiquitin-specific proteases (USPs) 7 . One of these, USP2, is able to remove ubiquitin from a range of protein substrates such as fatty acid synthase 8 , MDM2 9 , cyclin D1 10 and Aurora-A 11 . Fatty acid synthase has been reported to be highly expressed in a variety of cancers, including cancers of the prostate, ovary, lung, colon, and breast 12 , while MDM2, cyclin D1 and Aurora-A play critical roles in p53 regulation, cell cycle progression and mitotic events, respectively 9,10,13 . All of these studies suggest that the inhibition of USP2 may be a good therapeutic approach against cancers. In 2016, Davis et al. 6 reported that a small molecule, ML364, can induce cell cycle arrest and inhibit the growth of colorectal and mantle cell lymphoma cell lines via USP2 inhibition, albeit it is still not a clinical drug. In the present study, 6-thioguanine (6TG), an old drug still clinically used to treat leukemia, rheumatoid arthritis and bowel disease 14 , was identified as a potent USP2 inhibitor. Further studies using enzyme kinetics and X-ray crystallography to delineate its direct binding to USP2 were performed. Our findings support earlier results suggesting that 6TG has a broad spectrum of activity [15] [16] [17] , and have implications with respect to the need for direct clinical evaluation of its use against USP2-upregulated cancers.

3|chunk|Identification of inhibitors of human USP2. According to previous studies involving molecular docking experiments, the anti-leukemia and immunosuppressant drugs 6MP and 6TG, which act as inhibitors of SARS and MERS coronavirus papain-like proteases (PLpros), may also be able to bind to the active site of human USP2 as both kinds of enzymes share the palm-thumb-fingers structural scaffold and conserved catalytic triad Cys-His-Asp/Asn 17-20 . To validate the simulation results, the deubiquitination activity of the recombinant human USP2 catalytic domain (residues 258-605) was measured in the presence of various concentrations of 6MP or 6TG Published: xx xx xxxx OPEN www.nature.com/scientificreports/ 2 Scientific RepoRts | (2018) 8:3102 |
