1|chunk|To facilitate the intuitional analysis of protein sequences, a novel graphical representation of protein sequences called ADLD (Alignment Diagonal Line Diagram) is introduced in this paper first, and then a new ADLD based method is proposed and utilized to analyze the similarity/dissimilarity of protein sequences. Comparing with existing methods, our ADLD based method is proved to be effective in the similarity/dissimilarity analysis of protein sequences and have the merits of good intuition, visuality, and simplicity. The examinations of the similarities/dissimilarities for both the 16 different ND5 proteins and the 29 different spike proteins illustrate the utility of our ADLD based approach.
