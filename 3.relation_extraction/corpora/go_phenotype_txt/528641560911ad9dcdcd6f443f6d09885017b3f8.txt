1|chunk|Remarks for Aut hor: Wang et al. developed a drug screening syst em wit h a human SMN2 report er cell line and found that a compound increased the SMN2 prot ein level. The flow present ed in this manuscript is st raight forward and easy to underst and, but unfort unat ely the novelt y is not st rong in terms of the screening st rat egy to find enhancers of SMN2 expression (previously discussed elsewhere, e.g. Drugs. 2018 Mar;78(3):293-305., J Biomol Screen. 2012 Apr;17(4):481-95. Et c.), and invest igat ion for MOA of lead compounds is limit ed or not sufficient . Alt hough the approach is int erest ing, there are several issues to be resolved for scient ific significance.

2|chunk|Major point s:

3|chunk|1. Evaluat ion of the HTS assay syst em is insufficient . Posit ive cont rol is lacking and informat ion of the HTS met hod is poor. The aut hors described that they used fluorescence microscopy, but only the name of the light source was writ ten in the met hods wit hout explanat ion of the HTS syst em. It is unclear how HTS was conduct ed, how the fluorescence int ensit ies were evaluat ed using Image J, and how aut ofluorescence of dead cells was dist inguished. Furt hermore, the result of the screen showed poor reproducibilit y as present ed in Figure 2H . 10 of 14 hit compounds did not show the increase of SMN2 prot ein by West ern blot ting. The SMN2 expression pat tern in HEK293 might be complet ely different from that of pat ient fibroblast s, animal models, and pat ient s, and could have the possibilit y of abnormal karyot ype, including the locus in SMN1 or SMN2, aft er long-t ime passages. When the aut hors use pat ient fibroblast s to confirm the therapeut ic effect of hit compounds, cont rol fibroblast s should be set at the same time.

4|chunk|2. The aut hors described that Z-FA-FMK could elongat e the life span of SMA model mice in the result s sect ion. However, Z-FA-FMK did not show any posit ive effect on mouse survival wit h st at ist ical significance. Furt hermore, it is unclear why E64d, which was not a hit compound, was select ed in the next in vivo experiment s, even though there were several cyst eine prot ease inhibit ors. The aut hors should present the rat ionalit y.

5|chunk|3. Det ails of the met hod for in vivo experiment s are lacking. The aut hors should describe how they inject ed Z-FA-FMK int o lat eral cerebral vent ricles of post nat al day 1 -day 3 mice, and also how they decided the dose of compounds. It is unclear whet her the amount of Z-FA-FMK 60 ng (155 microM) of 1 microL per day is appropriat e for the treat ment .
