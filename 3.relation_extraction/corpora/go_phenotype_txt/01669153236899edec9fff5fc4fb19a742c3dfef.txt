1|chunk|Influenza epidemiological and virologic data from Georgia are limited. We aimed to present Influenza Like Illness (ILI) and Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) surveillance data and characterize influenza viruses circulating in the country over three influenza seasons.
1	124	130 Severe	Phenotype	HP_0012828
1	131	136 Acute	Phenotype	HP_0011009
1	137	158 Respiratory Infection	Phenotype	HP_0011947

2|chunk|We analyzed sentinel site ILI and SARI data for the 2014-2017 seasons in Georgia. Patients' samples were screened by real-time RT-PCR and influenza viruses isolated were characterized antigenically by haemagglutination inhibition assay and genetically by sequencing of HA and NA genes.
