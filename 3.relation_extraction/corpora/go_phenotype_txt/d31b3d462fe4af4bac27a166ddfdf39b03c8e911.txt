0|chunk|viruses Reverse Genetic Approaches for the Generation of Recombinant Zika Virus

1|chunk|Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emergent mosquito-borne member of the Flaviviridae family that was responsible for a recent epidemic in the Americas. ZIKV has been associated with severe clinical complications, including neurological disorder such as Guillain-Barr syndrome in adults and severe fetal abnormalities and microcephaly in newborn infants. Given the significance of these clinical manifestations, the development of tools and reagents to study the pathogenesis of ZIKV and to develop new therapeutic options are urgently needed. In this respect, the implementation of reverse genetic techniques has allowed the direct manipulation of the viral genome to generate recombinant (r)ZIKVs, which have provided investigators with powerful systems to answer important questions about the biology of ZIKV, including virus-host interactions, the mechanism of transmission and pathogenesis or the function of viral proteins. In this review, we will summarize the different reverse genetic strategies that have been implemented, to date, for the generation of rZIKVs and the applications of these platforms for the development of replicon systems or reporter-expressing viruses. caused major concerns due to the association of ZIKV infection with severe congenital abnormalities, including microcephaly in infants and an increased risk of Guillain-Barr syndrome in adults [15] [16] [17] [18] . ZIKV is mainly transmitted to people through the bite of an infected Aedes spp. mosquito (Ae. Aegypti and Ae. Albopictus) [19] , which carries a high risk for pregnant woman due to the ability to cross the placenta and infected fetal nervous tissues [20] . In addition to maternal-fetal transmission, ZIKV can also be transmitted from mother to child during pregnancy or spread through sexual contact, breastfeeding, blood transfusion and non-human primate bites [21-23].

2|chunk|ZIKV is an enveloped virus containing three structural proteins ( Figure 1 ): the capsid (C) protein, the membrane (M) protein and the envelope (E) glycoprotein ( Figure 1A ). Inside the virion, the viral (v)RNA genome is complexed with multiple copies of the C protein, surrounded by the E and M proteins, which are anchored in a lipid membrane ( Figure 1A ). The surface of the mature virion has a icosahedral shell consisting of 90 E:M heterodimers ( Figure 1A ) [24] . The viral genome is made of a positive single-stranded RNA molecule of approximately 10.8 kb with a single open reading frame, flanked at the 5 -and 3 -ends by the viral untranslated regions (UTRs) ( Figure 1B ). ZIKV vRNA is translated by cap-dependent initiation producing a single polyprotein of approximately 3423 amino acids, which is co-and post-transcriptionally processed by both viral and cellular proteases into the three structural proteins (C, pre-Membrane (prM) and E) and seven non-structural (NS) proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5) ( Figure 1B) . The structural proteins are essential components of the virion and are involved in viral entry, fusion and assembly. The NS proteins are mainly involved in vRNA synthesis, assembly and regulation of the host cell responses [25] . Phylogenetic analysis of ZIKV have revealed two major genetic lineages (African and Asian), which have undergone substantial changes during the past 50 years. Sequence homology analysis indicated that the strains that have been responsible for the recent human outbreaks throughout the Pacific and the Americas are phylogenetically related to the most recent Asian lineage [26, 27] .
