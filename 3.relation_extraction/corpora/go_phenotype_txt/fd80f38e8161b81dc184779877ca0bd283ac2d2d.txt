1|chunk|Human adenovirus (HAdV) infections cause disease world-wide. Whole genome sequencing has now distinguished 90 distinct genotypes in 7 species (A-G). Over half of these 90 HAdVs fall within species D, with essentially all of the HAdV-D whole genome sequences generated in the last decade. Herein, we describe recent new findings made possible by mining of this expanded genome database, and propose future directions to elucidate new functional elements and new functions for previously known viral components.
