1|chunk|Some coronaviruses (CoVs) have an extra furin cleavage site (RRKR/S, furin-S2 site) upstream of the fusion peptide in the spike protein, which plays roles in virion adsorption and fusion. Mutation of the S2 site of QX genotype (QX-type) infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) spike protein (S) in a recombinant virus background results in higher pathogenicity, pronounced neural symptoms and neurotropism when compared with conditions in wild-type IBV (WT-IBV) infected chickens. In this study, we present evidence suggesting that recombinant IBV with a mutant S2 site (furin-S2 site) leads to higher mortality. Infection with mutant IBV induces severe encephalitis and breaks the blood-brain barrier. The results of a neutralization test and immunoprotection experiment show that an original serum and vaccine can still provide effective protection in vivo and in vitro. This is the first demonstration of IBV-induced neural symptoms in chickens with encephalitis and the furin-S2 site as a determinant of neurotropism.

2|chunk|All CoV virions encode a set of four structural proteins, namely; spike glycoprotein (S), small envelope protein (E), membrane glycoprotein (M) and nucleocapsid proteins (N) [17, 18] . S protein belongs to the class I fusion proteins, located at the surface of the virion [19] . The trimeric S glycoprotein is a class I fusion protein and mediates attachment to the host receptor. S is typically cleaved by a host cell furin-like protease into two separate polypeptides named S1 and S2. S1 makes up the large receptor-binding domain of the S protein, while S2 forms the stalk of the spike molecule [20] . There is an extra furin cleavage site (furin-S2 site) upstream of the fusion peptide in the S2 subunit of some CoVs, which has been reported to influence the mechanism of invasion of host cells by CoVs. When the original sequence PTKR/S of SARS-CoV was replaced with RRKR/S, SARS-CoV could invade susceptible cells while no longer relying on cathepsin L [21] . Additionally, after the S2 site mutated into the furin-S2 site of the MHV-A59 strain, MHV can fuse with susceptible cells in the early endosome, but not lysosome, without requiring lysosomal enzymes such as MERS-CoV [22] . As for IBV, the furin-S2 site is a determinant of cellular adaptation of the IBV-Beaudette strain. If this motif is lacking, the IBV-Beaudette strain, which is normally the only IBV strain able to adapt to the Vero cell line, can no longer grow in these cells [23] [24] [25] .

3|chunk|Most basic research on IBV performed to date has been based on the IBV-Beaudette strain; therefore, much remains unknown about the pathogenic mechanism of QX-type IBV. Here, we rescued a mutant QX-type IBV with the furin-S2 site and compared the pathogenicity of the mutant IBV with its parental virus. We also further investigated the tissue and cell tropism. Finally, we clarified the biological significance with an immunoprotection experiment. The function of S protein in QX-type IBV was demonstrated, which is more valuable for poultry than research about the IBV-Beaudette strain.
