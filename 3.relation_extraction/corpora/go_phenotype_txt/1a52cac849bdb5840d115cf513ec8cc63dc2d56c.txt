1|chunk|Unlike canonical pre-mRNAs, animal replication-dependent histone pre-mRNAs lack introns and are processed at the 3'-end by a mechanism distinct from cleavage and polyadenylation. They have a 3' stem loop and histone downstream element (HDE) that are recognized by stem-loop binding protein (SLBP) and U7 snRNP, respectively. The N-terminal domain (NTD) of Lsm11, a component of U7 snRNP, interacts with FLASH NTD and these two proteins recruit the histone cleavage complex containing the CPSF-73 endonuclease for the cleavage reaction. Here, we determined crystal structures of FLASH NTD and found that it forms a coiled-coil dimer. Using solution light scattering, we characterized the stoichiometry of the FLASH NTD-Lsm11 NTD complex and found that it is a 2:1 heterotrimer, which is supported by observations from analytical ultracentrifugation and crosslinking.

PLoS ONE 12(10): e0186034. https:// Biochemical studies of the 3'-end processing machinery that cleaves replication-dependent histone pre-mRNAs have shown that it is comprised of the stem-loop binding protein (SLBP), U7 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (U7 snRNP), FLASH, and the histone pre-mRNA cleavage complex (HCC) [1, [3] [4] [5] [6] . SLBP binds the 3' stem-loop in the pre-mRNA and remains bound after mRNA maturation, and functions in translation [7, 8] . The 3' stem-loop also recruits the 3'-5' exoribonuclease 3'hExo [9, 10], which is not essential for processing [11] but trims the processed histone mRNAs and initiates degradation of histone mRNAs in the cytoplasm [12] . The core U7 snRNP consists of two integral and stably associated components:~60-nucleotide U7 snRNA and a unique Sm ring, which contains Lsm10 and Lsm11 in place of the spliceosomal SmD1 and SmD2 [13, 14] . The U7 snRNP recognizes the pre-mRNA through base-pairing between the 5'-end of U7 snRNA and the HDE [15, 16] . SLBP bound to the upstream stemloop stabilizes this interaction, likely by directly or indirectly contacting a subunit(s) of U7 snRNP [17] .

3|chunk|Lsm11 has an extended N-terminal domain ( Fig 1A) that is unique among members of the functionally characterized Sm proteins. Through yeast two-hybrid and pull-down studies, this region was found to interact with the N-terminal region of FLASH ( Fig 1B) [3]. FLASH, Fliceassociated huge protein, was originally discovered as a protein involved in Fas-mediated apoptosis [18] and later in regulation of expression of several genes, including oncogenes [19, 20] . Subsequent studies showed that FLASH localizes to Histone Locus Bodies in the nucleus, suggesting a role in expression of histone genes [21], and that it is essential for histone pre-mRNA processing [3] .

4|chunk|Biochemical studies revealed that the interacting N-terminal regions of Lsm11 and FLASH form a docking platform that recruits the HCC to the U7 snRNP [22]. The HCC is composed of a specific subset of proteins that also participate in cleavage and polyadenylation [23, 24], including the endonuclease CPSF-73, CPSF-100, symplekin and CstF-64 [1, [25][26][27]. Mutational studies on FLASH identified an LDLY motif (residues 55-58 in human FLASH, Fig 1B) as essential for binding the HCC, while residues 100-139 are involved in Lsm11 binding [22, 28].

5|chunk|The molecular details of how FLASH acts as a mediator between Lsm11 and HCC are still unclear. To shed some light on the essential role of FLASH in 3'-end processing of replicationdependent histone pre-mRNA processing [3], we carried out structural studies on the human FLASH N-terminal domain (NTD) encompassing residues 51-137 using X-ray crystallography. We also performed biophysical studies on the FLASH NTD and the FLASH NTD-Lsm11 NTD complex to characterize their oligomeric states and the stoichiometry of their complex.

6|chunk|Results

7|chunk|We determined a structure of the wild-type human FLASH NTD at 2.6  resolution using Xray crystallography (Table 1 ). The initial phases were obtained by the single anomalous dispersion (SAD) method using crystals of selenomethionyl FLASH NTD. The structure showed that FLASH NTD forms a coiled-coil dimer consisting of two parallel -helices, one from each protomer (Fig 2A) . However, only residues 71 to 137 were observed in this structure, even though the expression construct contained residues 51-137. Residues 51-70, which include the LDLY motif previously shown to be essential for histone pre-mRNA processing [28] and for binding the HCC [22], are disordered in this crystal. The first 30 residues of FLASH are poorly conserved among homologs (Fig 1B) , although there is substantial conservation from Drosophila to mammals for residues 55-137 in the N-terminal segment.
