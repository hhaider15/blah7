1|chunk|Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a highly transmissible coronavirus that causes a severe enteric disease particularly in neonatal piglets. In this study, a rapid method for detecting PEDV was developed based on cross-priming amplification and nucleic acid test strip(CPA-NATS). Five primers specific for the N gene sequence of PEDV were used for the cross-priming amplification. Detection of amplification products based on labeled probe primers was conducted with strip binding antibody of labeled markers. The CPA method was evaluated and compared with a PCR method. The reverse transcription CPA system was further optimized for detecting PEDV RNA in clinical specimens. Results showed that the method was highly specific for the detection of PEDV, and had the same sensitivity as PCR, with detection limit of 10 6 diluted plasmid containing the target gene of PEDV. It was also successfully applied to detecting PEDV in clinical specimens. The reverse transcription CPA-NATS detection system established in this study offers a specific, sensitive, rapid, and simple detection tool for screening PEDV, which can contribute to strategies in the effective control of PEDV in swine.

3|chunk|In order to detect the PEDV RNA from clinical specimens, a system including RT and CPA was optimized. AMV reverse transcriptase(BioFlux, Hangzhou, China) was used due to its tolerance to high temperature even at 65 C. Bst DNA polymerase was changed to Gsp Fast polymerase (Ustar Biotech, Hangzhou, China) to adapt to RNA detection. The optimization condition of all components, except for AMV, Gsp Fast polymerase, and RNA secure, was retained. AMV, Gsp Fast polymerase, and RNA secure in the RT CPA-NATS system were optimized.

4|chunk|RT CPA-NATS used for detection of PEDV in clinical specimens. We collected 41 viscera samples from pigs apparently infected with PEDV from 3 regions (Chengdu, Harbin, and Jinan) of China to evaluate the PEDV RT CPA-NATS method. Samples 1-20 were obtained from Chengdu, 21-31 from Harbin, and 32-41 from Jinan. We tested the 41 specimens using the constructed PEDV RT CPA-NATS method. In the same manner, RT-PCR tests with outer primers pair of CPA were conducted on these specimens to confirm CPA.

5|chunk|Nonprofessional personnel in a livestock farm conducted the RT CPA-NATS to detect PEDV in the samples to verify the clinical use effect of the RT CPA-NATS method. The same samples were tested using their developed RT-PCR method with the detection primers D-800-F/R, which match M and N gene of PEDV, respectively ( Table 1 ). The product length was 800 bp.
