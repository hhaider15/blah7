1|chunk|The accuracy and sensitivity of PCR-based methods for detection of hepatitis A virus (HAV) are dependent on the methods used to separate and concentrate the HAV from the infected cells. The pH and ionic strength affect the binding affinity of the virus to cells. In this study, we initially investigated the effects of pH (4.0-10.0) and metal ions (Fe 2+ , Co 2+ , Cu 2+ , Mg 2+ , K + , and Ca 2+ ) on the binding of HAV to oyster digestive cells. The lowest relative binding (RB) of HAV to the cells was found at pH 4.0 and in FeSO 4 solution (64.6% and 68.1%, respectively). To develop an alternative to antibody-dependent immunomagnetic separation prior to detection of HAV using RT-PCR, the binding of HAV to five lectins, peanut agglutinin (PNA), Dolichos biflorus agglutinin (DBA), Helix pomatia agglutinin (HPA), Ulex europaeus agglutinin (UEA-1) and soybean agglutinin (SBA), was evaluated using ELISAs. SBA showed significantly higher RB to HAV than

Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of using SMS combined with RT-PCR to detect HAV at dilutions ranging from 10 1 -10 4 of a HAV stock (titer: 10 4 TCID 50 /mL).

4|chunk|Viruses are a major cause of foodborne illness, due in large part to the contamination of shellfish by hepatitis A virus (HAV) [1] . HAV, the prototype of the Hepatovirus genus within the Piconaviridae family, is composed of an icosahedral capsid that contains a positive sense single-stranded RNA genome [2, 3] . HAV infection is associated with the consumption of virus-contaminated bivalves, including oysters, clams, cockles and mussels, which accumulate the virus from seawater as they filter-feed [4] . Moreover, the increasingly widespread incidence of oyster-related HAV infection is attracting greater attention to the mechanisms underlying the interaction between HAV and oyster [5] .

5|chunk|The detection of HAV is influenced by the binding affinity of the virus for receptor cells, which is affected by the pH and ionic strength of the test solution, the presence of compounds competing for sorption, and the properties of the virus [6]. In general, low pH reduces the infectivity of enteroviruses, as it reduces the stability of virus. However, HAV shows greater stability at low pH than other enteroviruses, which increases the possibility of infection to the cells [7]. Exposing a virus to change in pH can affect binding by altering the conformation of viral proteins e.g., hemagglutinin and spike protein, which respectively mediate the binding of influenza and coronaviruses to the target cells [8, 9] . In addition, metal compounds yield specific acids in aqueous solution, so that the ionic strength of a solution will depend on the types of metals present. Consequently, the effects of pH and metal ions on the binding of viruses to cells are considered to be important factors for the detection of viruses in food. To date, however, there have been few studies addressing this issue. Zajac et al. reported that Ca 2+ promotes the interaction between HAV and BS-C-1 cells (monkey kidney cell line) [10], and Bishop et al. showed that low pH and divalent metal ions (Mg 2+ , Ca 2+ and Zn 2+ ) enhance the interaction between HAV and BS-C-1 cells due to changes in the viral capsid conformation [11] . Although these studies provide useful information on the binding of HAV to BS-C-1 cells, much remains to be learned about the effects of pH and metal ions on the binding of HAV to different cell types.

6|chunk|Methods investigated as potential approaches for the detection of HAV in oysters include various polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques, such as nested-PCR [12, 13] , reverse transcription (RT)-PCR [14-17] and real time 19] . However, the detection of HAV is not directly compatible with PCR, because the method requires an appropriate concentration of sample, removal of interfering substances and the ability to distinguish between infectious and non-infectious virus particles [20, 21] . Although methods for concentrating virus, such as acid adsorption-elution, solvent extraction, polyethylene glycol precipitation and adsorption-elution-precipitation, have been developed to improve the efficiency of viral detection [22, 23] , these methods are time consuming and are not
