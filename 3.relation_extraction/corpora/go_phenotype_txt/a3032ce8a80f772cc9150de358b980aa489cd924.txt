1|chunk|An electrochemical flexible biosensor composed of gold (Au), molybdenum disulfide nanoparticles (MoS 2 NPs), and Au (Au/MoS 2 /Au nanolayer) on the polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate is developed to detect envelope glycoprotein GP120 (gp120), the surface protein of HIV-1. To fabricate the nanolayer on the PET substrate, Au is sputter coated on the flexible PET substrate and MoS 2 NPs are spin coated on Au, which is sputter coated once again with Au. The gp120 antibody is then immobilized on this flexible electrode through cysteamine (Cys) modified on the surface of the Au/MoS 2 /Au nanolayer. Fabrication of the biosensor is verified by atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and cyclic voltammetry. A flexibility test is done using a micro-fatigue tester. Detection of the gp120 is measured by square wave voltammetry. The results indicate that the prepared biosensor detects 0.1 pg/mL of gp120, which is comparable with previously reported gp120 biosensors prepared even without flexibility. Therefore, the proposed biosensor supports the development of a nanomaterial-based flexible sensing platform for highly sensitive biosensors with flexibility for wearable device application.
