1|chunk|The number of emerging infectious diseases is increasing. Characterizing novel or re-emerging infections is aided by the availability of pathogen genomes. In this review, we evaluate methods that exploit pathogen sequences and the contribution of genomic analysis to understand the epidemiology of recently emerged infectious diseases.
