1|chunk|Background: Glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) is the most important ingredient in licorice due to its outstanding anti-inflammatory activity and wide application in the medicine and cosmetics industries. Contemporary industrial production of GA by acid hydrolysis of glycyrrhizin which was extracted from Glycyrrhiza plants, is not environment-friendly and devastates farmland since the Glycyrrhiza rhizomes grow up to 10 m underground.
