1|chunk|Background. Tanreqing injection (TRQ) is a commonly used herbal patent medicine for treating inflammatory airway diseases in view of its outstanding anti-inflammatory properties. In this study, we explored the signaling pathways involved in contributions of TRQ to LPS-induced airway inflammation in rats. Methods/Design. Adult male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats randomly divided into different groups received intratracheal instillation of LPS and/or intraperitoneal injection of TRQ. Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid (BALF) and lung samples were collected at 24 h, 48 h, and 96 h after TRQ administration. Protein and mRNA levels of tumor necrosis factor-(TNF-) , Interleukin-(IL-) 1 , IL-6, and IL-8 in BALF and lung homogenate were observed by ELISA and realtime PCR, respectively. Lung sections were stained for p38 MAPK and NF-B detection by immunohistochemistry. Phospho-p38 MAPK, phosphor-extracellular signal-regulated kinases ERK1/2, phospho-SAPK/JNK, phospho-NF-B p65, phospho-IKK / , and phospho-I B-were measured by western blot analysis. Results. The results showed that TRQ significantly counteracted LPSstimulated release of TNF-, IL-1 , IL-6, and IL-8, attenuated cells influx in BALF, mitigated mucus hypersecretion, suppressed phosphorylation of NF-B p65, I B-, KK / , ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 MAPK, and inhibited p38 MAPK and NF-B p65 expression in rat lungs. Conclusions. Results of the current research indicate that TRQ possesses potent exhibitory effects in LPS-induced airway inflammation by, at least partially, suppressing the MAPKs and NF-B signaling pathways, in a general dose-dependent manner.
