2|chunk|Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) has a significant impact on the livestock industry because of its high mortality rate in young ruminants and causation of a high abortion rate in pregnant animals. Human RVFV infections generally manifest as self-limiting and non-fatal illnesses. However, a small percentage of patients develop encephalitis, vision loss and hemorrhagic fever with a high mortality rate. Currently, there is no commercially available vaccine for human use or effective antiviral drug for RVFV treatment. The non-structural protein NSs is a major virulence factor of RVFV, which mediates suppression of host general transcription, inhibition of IFN- transcription and degradation of PKR, to block host antiviral responses. To examine the contribution of host transcription inhibition to RVFV virulence, we generated RVFV MP-12 strain-derived mutants that have attenuated inhibitory activity on host transcription due to amino acid mutations in NSs. The mutant viruses showed attenuated cytotoxicity in cell culture and attenuated virulence in young mice, demonstrating the contribution of NSs-mediated host transcription inhibition to the virulence of RVFV.
