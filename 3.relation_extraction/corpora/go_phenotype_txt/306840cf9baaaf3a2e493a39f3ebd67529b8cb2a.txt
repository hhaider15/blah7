1|chunk|ectodomains defined the dynamic conformation of the protein. These structures offered snapshots of closed, intermediate and open APN, which represent distinct functional states. Coronavirus envelope proteins specifically recognized the open APN form, prevented ectodomain progression to the closed form and substrate hydrolysis. In addition, drugs that bind the active site inhibited both coronavirus binding to cell surface APN and infection; the drugs probably hindered APN transition to the virusspecific open form. We conclude that allosteric inhibition of APN functions occurs by ligand suppression of ectodomain motions necessary for catalysis and virus cell entry, as validated by locking APN with disulfides. Blocking APN dynamics can thus be a valuable approach to development of drugs that target this ectoenzyme.

2|chunk|Aminopeptidases are widely distributed among plants and animals, and catalyze amino acid cleavage from the N terminus of proteins and peptides 1 . Numerous aminopeptidases have been identified and grouped in several families 2 . They can be soluble or membrane-bound, they bear metal ions at the active site and are also known as metallopeptidases or metalloproteases. Zinc is the most common metal ion in aminopeptidases, and one or two zinc atoms can be present in the active site 1 . Aminopeptidase N (APN, CD13) belongs to the M1 family of zinc metallopeptidases 3 , also termed gluzincins, which comprises enzymes of medical interest for infectious and autoimmune diseases, cancer and hypertension 4-10 .

3|chunk|APN is associated with various cell functions and diseases, and has been termed the "moonlighting enzyme" 3 . It is a zinc-dependent metallopeptidase that hydrolyzes the N terminus of biological peptides and extracellular matrix proteins. APN-mediated peptide hydrolysis and activation is important for regulation of several physiological processes, such as the control of blood pressure (angiotensins) or cell chemotaxis. In addition, APN is linked to cell motility and tumor metastasis. APN is overexpressed in the neovasculature, including tumor blood vessels; its relevance in angiogenesis was discovered using NGR peptides and was later confirmed in animal models 7,11 . Peptides and inhibitors target APN overexpressed in tumors, and prevent tumor cell growth and invasion 12,13 ; drugs that bind to the active site of this protein have been developed to treat tumors and some are in clinical trials 10 . In addition to its association with angiogenesis and cancer, APN is a major coronavirus (CoV) cell entry receptor 4,5,14 . CoV recognition of APN is species-specific, and specificity is associated with N-linked glycosylation in the APN protein 15,16 . We defined how some CoV recognize their APN receptor and the basis for virus-receptor binding specificity 16 .

4|chunk|Mammalian APN are type II membrane-bound ectoenzymes that dimerize on the cell surface 3,17 . They are composed of a short cytoplasmic domain, followed by the transmembrane domain and an extracellular ectodomain with ~930 amino acid residues and several N-linked and O-linked glycosylations 3,18 . The APN ectodomain is composed of four domains, domain I to IV 16, 19 , connected to the membrane by a short linker or stalk 3,18 . The three N-terminal domains I-III are more similar to homologous domains of M1 family members, whereas domain IV is more divergent 3 . Domain II has a thermolysin-like fold and contains the zinc-coordination residues conserved in the active site of gluzincins, two histidines in the HEXXH motif, and a glutamic acid ~24 residues distal from that motif 2, 16, 19 . Several crystal structures of APN in complex with peptides and drugs showed how substrates bind to the active site, providing clues to peptide hydrolysis [19] [20] [21] . The human and pig APN ectodomains share 79% residue identity, domain architecture and dimerization 16, 19 . The C-terminal domain IV is the largest APN domain and, according to the crystal structures, mediates protein dimerization 16, 19 . Porcine CoV recognize a membrane-distal domain IV region, which includes an N-linked glycan in pig APN, as well as a small cavity formed by domain II and IV 16 . The mode by which other CoV recognize the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) or dipeptidylpeptidase 4 (DPP4) is distinct from APN 22 , although a glycan N-linked to DPP4 is also involved in the interaction.

5|chunk|Structures of the M1 metallopeptidases tricorn-interacting factor F3 and the endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase-1 (ERAP-1) indicate that M1 family members can adopt diverse conformations 23,24 . F3 structures define a closed, an intermediate and an open state, based on accessibility of the catalytic site in domain II, which is determined by the position of domain IV relative to domain II. It is proposed that substrates gain access to the active site in the open state and that the enzyme must close for peptide hydrolysis 20, 23, 24 . Nonetheless, the role in catalysis of the dynamic transition between states has not been determined. Functional assays using monoclonal antibodies (mAb) indicated a dynamic conformation for cell surface APN; the MY7 mAb recognized a subset of APN molecules, and the presence of its epitope in HL60 cells varied with substrates and/or inhibitors 25 . Antibody binding did not alter protein dimerization, but pointed to changes in APN ectodomain conformation on the cell surface 25 .

6|chunk|We determined several crystal structures of dimeric human and porcine APN (hAPN and pAPN) ectodomains, which reveal the dynamic conformation of this protein. A dimer is preserved in all structures. The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of a porcine CoV bound specifically to the open pAPN form and inhibited catalysis, probably by preventing APN dynamics and closure. In contrast, drugs that bound to the active site, which likely maintained a closed protein, inhibited CoV protein binding and infection. Blocking APN ectodomain motion with disulfide bonds inhibited its functions. Thus, our results show the importance of APN dynamics in catalysis and virus infection.
