1|chunk|A Supporting Information Figure 1 A. Design of 9-, 10-, 11-mer peptides derived from the 15-mer antigen. Overlapping 9-, 10-, 11-mer peptides were each tested for their capability to stabilize the corresponding HLA. A total of 18 different peptides were derived from each 15-mer peptide.

2|chunk|B. HLA-stability ELISA results for soluble HLA-B*40:01 molecules that were ligand-exchanged with 9-, 10-, 11-mers truncated peptides from SARS NP44 15-mer peptide. Non-irradiated HLA with conditional ligand and no peptide added (-UV), irradiated HLA and no peptide added (+UV), or with indicated 9-, 10-, 11-mers peptides. Peptides are labeled as capable (red bars) or incapable (white bars) of stabilizing the corresponding HLA.

3|chunk|C. Similar to Part B, HLA-stability ELISA results for soluble HLA-B*40:01 molecules that were ligand-exchanged with 9-, 10-, 11-mers truncated peptides from SARS NP65 15-mer peptide.

4|chunk|D. Similar to Part B, HLA-stability ELISA results for soluble HLA-B*55:02 molecules that were ligand-exchanged with 9-, 10-, 11-mers truncated peptides from DENV NS3-108 15-mer peptide.

5|chunk|E. Similar to Part B, HLA-stability ELISA results for soluble HLA-B*58:01 molecules that were ligand-exchanged with 9-, 10-, 11-mers truncated peptides from SARS 3a2 15-mer peptide.

6|chunk|F. Similar to Part B, HLA-stability ELISA results for soluble HLA-B*58:01 molecules that were ligand-exchanged with 9-, 10-, 11-mers truncated peptides from HBV Pol33 15-mer peptide.

7|chunk|G. Similar to Part B, HLA-stability ELISA results for soluble HLA-B*58:01 molecules that were ligand-exchanged with 9-, 10-, 11-mers truncated peptides from HBV Env72 15-mer peptide.

8|chunk|H.Similar to Part B, HLA-stability ELISA results for soluble HLA-C*08:01 molecules that were ligand-exchanged with 9-, 10-, 11-mers truncated peptides from HBV Env34 15-mer peptide.

9|chunk|I. HLA-stability ELISA results for soluble HLA molecules that were ligand-exchanged with 9-, 10-, 11-mers truncated peptides from the indicated15-mer peptide. Non-irradiated HLA with conditional ligand and no peptide added (-UV), irradiated HLA and no peptide added (+UV), or with indicated 9-, 10-, 11-mers peptides.
