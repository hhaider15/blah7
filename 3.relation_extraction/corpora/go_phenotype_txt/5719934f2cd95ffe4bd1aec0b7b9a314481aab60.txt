1|chunk|The repair of white matter damage is of paramount importance for functional recovery after brain injuries. Here, we report that interleukin-4 (IL-4) promotes oligodendrocyte regeneration and remyelination. IL-4 receptor expression was detected in a variety of glial cells after ischemic brain injury, including oligodendrocyte lineage cells. IL-4 deficiency in knockout mice resulted in greater deterioration of white matter over 14 d after stroke. Consistent with these findings, intranasal delivery of IL-4 nanoparticles after stroke improved white matter integrity and attenuated long-term sensorimotor and cognitive deficits in wild-type mice, as revealed by histological immunostaining, electron microscopy, diffusion tensor imaging, and electrophysiology. The selective effect of IL-4 on remyelination was verified in an ex vivo organotypic model of demyelination. By leveraging primary oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), microglia-depleted mice, and conditional OPC-specific peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor gamma (PPAR) knockout mice, we discovered a direct salutary effect of IL-4 on oligodendrocyte differentiation that was mediated by the PPAR axis. Our findings reveal a new regenerative role of IL-4 in the central nervous system (CNS), which lies beyond its known immunoregulatory functions on microglia/macrophages or peripheral lymphocytes. Therefore, intranasal IL-4 delivery may represent a novel therapeutic strategy to improve white matter integrity in stroke and other brain injuries.

2|chunk|The primary focus of stroke research has traditionally been on neuronal damage within gray matter, but emerging evidence reveals a robust correlation between white matter injury and long-term sensorimotor and cognitive deficits after stroke [1] . White matter accounts for approximately 60% of total brain volume in humans. It is composed mostly of bundled axons and glial cells, including myelin-producing oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and microglia. Large axons in the brain are enwrapped by the insulating myelin sheath, which greatly accelerates neural transmission along nerve fibers. White matter damage after stroke involves multiple mechanisms, including demyelination, degeneration of axons, and neuroinflammation [2] [3] [4] . The vulnerability of oligodendrocytes to ischemic injury and the resultant demyelination have been reported in numerous publications using different stroke models [5] [6] [7] [8] . Remyelination is a process whereby new myelin sheaths are generated around demyelinated axons in the adult central nervous system (CNS) after injuries. It is one of the critical regenerative mechanisms for white matter repair after brain injuries. The differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) into mature oligodendrocytes plays a central role in remyelination. OPCs are present in the normal adult brain [9] . Both the proliferation and migration of OPCs appear to increase in the adult ischemic brain [10], suggestive of endogenous efforts at remyelination and white matter repair. Cellular fate mapping studies have demonstrated the differentiation of OPCs toward the oligodendrocyte lineage in the ischemic brain, but the majority of these cells fail to develop into mature, functional oligodendrocytes [11] [12] [13] . As a result of this failure, white matter integrity after stroke shows little improvement over time [10] . Aside from these roadblocks, the efficacy of oligodendrocyte regeneration and axon remyelination also declines with age [14] . Without proper remyelination, naked axons are degraded, thereby interrupting neuronal communication and leading to functional disabilities. Therefore, therapeutic interventions to promote the differentiation of OPCs into mature oligodendrocytes and enhance the remyelination of axons are promising strategies to achieve successful white matter repair and functional recovery after stroke [11] .

3|chunk|Interleukin-4 (IL-4) is an anti-inflammatory cytokine produced by a variety of immune cells, but accumulating evidence indicates that IL-4 harbors functions beyond immune modulation in the CNS. For example, one early report suggested that IL-4 promoted learning and memory capacities in the normal brain [15] . This conclusion, however, was challenged by more recent studies demonstrating equivalent baseline cognitive functions between wild-type (WT) and IL-4 knockout (KO) genotypes [16, 17] . Instead, the IL-4 KO mice were shown to display anxiety-like behavior [17] . Despite these discrepancies in studies of IL-4 KO mice, the importance of IL-4 in maintaining or restoring neurological functions under pathological conditions is widely accepted. For example, the reduction of IL-4 levels with advanced age is thought to contribute to the cognitive decline in aged populations and in Alzheimer disease [18] . We previously documented increased expression of IL-4 and the IL-4 receptor in the ischemic brain [16] . IL-4 may be released from injured neurons and peripheral immune cells that have infiltrated the brain after stroke [19] . IL-4 deficiency exacerbates brain injury and neurological deficits in acute timeframes after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) [20] , implicating IL-4 as an endogenous protective mechanism in the early stages after stroke. We also reported that IL-4 deficiency significantly impairs long-term sensorimotor and cognitive performance after ischemic injury, whereas IL-4 supplementation improves functional outcomes in two models of stroke [16] . Although IL-4 deficiency increased the loss of NeuN + brain tissue at acute phases of stroke, it did not influence neuronal tissue loss at late stages [16] . These results suggest that the long-term beneficial role of IL-4 on neurological functions after stroke might be attributed to its protection of nonneuronal cells, such as white IL-4/PPAR signaling improves white matter repair after stroke PLOS Biology | https://doi.org/10.
