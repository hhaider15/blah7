1|chunk|The bacterium Clostridium botulinum is the causative agent of botulism-a severe intoxication caused by botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) and characterized by damage to the nervous system. In an effort to develop novel C. botulinum immunotherapeutics, camelid single-domain antibodies (sdAbs, VHHs, or nanobodies) could be used due to their unique structure and characteristics. In this study, VHHs were produced using phage display technology. A total of 15 different monoclonal VHHs were selected based on their comlementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) sequences. Different toxin lethal dose (LD 50 ) challenges with each selected phage clone were conducted in vivo to check their neutralizing potency. We demonstrated that modification of neutralizing VHHs with a human immunoglobulin G (IgG)1 Fc (fragment crystallizable) fragment (fusionbody, VHH-Fc) significantly increased the circulation time in the blood (up to 14 days). At the same time, VHH-Fc showed the protective activity 1000 times higher than monomeric form when challenged with 5 LD 50 . Moreover, VHH-Fcs remained protective even 14 days after antibody administration. These results indicate that this VHH-Fc could be used as an effective long term antitoxin protection against botulinum type A.
