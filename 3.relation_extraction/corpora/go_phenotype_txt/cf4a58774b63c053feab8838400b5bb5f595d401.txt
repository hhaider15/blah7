1|chunk|2013. From 2014, outbreaks were also reported from Central Europe. To characterize the Central European PEDV strains regarding their virulence in suckling piglets, and to assess the protective effect of maternally derived antibodies (MDA), four trial groups were randomly assigned, each consisting of two pregnant sows and their litter. To induce MDA in a subset of piglets, two sows received a cell culture-adapted PEDV strain, and another two sows were inoculated with field material from German PED outbreaks. Four sows stayed nave. Subsequently, all piglets were inoculated with the corresponding PEDV strains at an age of 3 to 6 days, and virus shedding, clinical signs and occurrence of specific antibodies were assessed. Piglets without MDA showed a morbidity of 100% and low lethality, while almost all MDA-positive piglets stayed clinically healthy and showed considerably lower virus shedding. Taken together, the Central European PEDV strains showed rather low virulence under experimental conditions, and pre-inoculation of sows led to a solid protection of their offspring. The latter is the prerequisite for a sow vaccination concept that could help to prevent PED induced losses in the piglet sector.

2|chunk|Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is a highly contagious enteric disease of swine, affecting pigs of all ages. Severe clinical signs and high mortality rates are especially observed in suckling piglets and severity of disease decreases with age. However, strain virulence and management conditions also impact on the clinical disease and outcome 1-3 .

The causative agent is PED virus (PEDV), an enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus of the genus Alphacoronavirus within the Coronaviridae virus family of the order Nidovirales 4 .

4|chunk|Porcine epidemic diarrhea first emerged in 1971 in England termed Epidemic Diarrhea (ED) 5, 6 . These early outbreaks were characterized by severe clinical signs and mortality rates of up to 100% in young fattening pigs. In the beginning, no cases were reported from suckling pigs. Later on, pigs of all ages showed similar disease in different European countries, and over the following years, PED was reported from Belgium,
