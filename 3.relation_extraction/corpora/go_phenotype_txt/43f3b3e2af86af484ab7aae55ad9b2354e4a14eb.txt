Since then, the Hong Kong government has been promoting the benefits of proper hand hygiene. ere are few studies that explore the general quality of handwashing and the hand-hygiene practices of the public of Hong Kong; given this, the aim of this study is to explore this neglected topic. is study is a quantitative study that was conducted in January 2018. e results show that the majority of participants only wash their hands after using the toilet (87%) or handling vomitus or faecal matter (91%). e mean duration of handwashing was 36.54 seconds (SD  18.57). e areas of the hand most neglected during handwashing were the fingertips (48.1%), medial area (30.5%), and back of the hand (28%). A multiple logistic regression shows that participants who have reached third-level education or higher often tend to be more hand hygienic than those who have not reached third-level education (p  0.001, B  1.003). us, participants aged 30 and above tend to neglect 5 more areas of the hand than those aged below 30 (p  0.001, B  4.933).
