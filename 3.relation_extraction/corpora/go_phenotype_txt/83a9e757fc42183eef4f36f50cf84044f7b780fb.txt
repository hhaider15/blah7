Huh7.5 cells (left panel), DPP4-untransfected HEK 293 cells (middle panel), and DPP4-transfected HEK 293 cells (right panel) were stained with goat anti-DPP4 antibody (in blue) and control antibody (in red) and analyzed by flow cytometry. (b) Transduction of DPP4-expressing cells by pseudotyped MERS-CoV England1 virus. Huh7.5 and HEK 293 cells without and with DPP4-transfection (in grey and black bars) were transduced by MERS-CoV pseudotyped virus. Relative expression of luciferase activity was measured (CPS). Untransfected and untransduced cells were used as the background control (open bars). Each bar represents the mean of triplicate assays with standard errors. One representative of two experiments is shown. (c) Transduction of Huh7.5 cells by MERS-CoV pseudovirus was blocked by soluble human DPP4 (sDPP4). MERS-CoV England1 pseudovirus was incubated with soluble human DPP4 before transduction of Huh7.5 cells. Relative luciferase activity (CPS) is shown. (d) Transduction of Huh7.5 cells by MERS-CoV pseudovirus was blocked by anti-DPP4, but not anti-ACE2 antibody. Huh7.5 cells were incubated with anti-DPP4 or anti-ACE2 polyclonal antibodies and then transduced with MERS-CoV England1 pseudovirus. Relative luciferase activity (CPS) is shown. Each data point in (c) and (d) represents the mean of triplicate assays with standard errors. One representative of two repeated experiments is shown.
