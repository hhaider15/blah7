1|chunk|The Gillespie Algorithm 693 In the section "Predicting epidemic behavior", we discussed that to use Eq. (11) to 694 project the expected behavior of an epidemic outcome Z using the accrued observation 695 Y i at time t i , one needs access to a stochastic simulator to sample from the random 696 variable Z| i for a given set of parameter values . We use the Gillespie algorithm [40] 697 for this purpose. To describe the steps of the Gillespie algorithm, we consider an 698 epidemic model with K compartments (e.g. in the model described in  "Design of the 699 Performance Analysis", K = 4). Let (t) = ( 1 (t),  2 (t), . . . ,  K (t)) denote the state of 700 the epidemic at time t, where  k (t) denotes the number of individuals in compartment 701 k  {1, 2, . . . , K} at time t.

2|chunk|The state of an epidemic (i.e. (t)) may change due to the occurrence of specific 703 events, such the transmission of the disease to a susceptible or the recovery from the 704 disease. We use Q to denote the number of such events. In the model shown in Fig 3, 705 these epidemic events include Infection, Seeking Treatment, and Recovery (and hence 706 Q = 3). Let  q ((t), ) denote the rate at which the event q is occurring when the 707 epidemic is at state (t) and with parameter values  that is a transformation of the 708 parameter .

3|chunk|Note that the stochastic model usually uses a volume dependent transformation of 710 the parameter  from the ODE model. We do not need this transformation as our ODE 711 description is volume independent.

The 716 Gillespie algorithm proceeds as follows.
