An estimated 390 million people are at risk for infection with DENV and there are no effective vaccines or therapeutics. We utilized RNA chromatography coupled with quantitative mass spectrometry (qMS) to identify host RNA binding proteins (RBPs) that interact with DENV-2 RNA. We identified ERI3 (also PRNPIP and PINT1), a putative 3-5 RNA exonuclease, which preferentially associates with DENV-2 genomic RNA via interactions with dumbbell structures in the 3 UTR. ERI3 is required for accumulation of DENV-2 genomic RNA and production of infectious particles. Furthermore, the mosquito homologue of ERI3 is required for DENV-2 replication in adult Aedes aegypti mosquitos implying that the requirement for ERI3 is conserved in both DENV hosts. In human cells ERI3 localizes to the Golgi in uninfected cells, but relocalizes near sites of DENV-2 replication in infected cells. ERI3 is not required for maintaining DENV-2 RNA stability or translation of the viral polyprotein, but is required for viral RNA synthesis. Our results define a specific role for ERI3 and highlight the importance of Golgi proteins in DENV-2 replication.

3|chunk|The DENV genome is a capped, non-polyadenylated positive-strand RNA that encodes three structural proteins (C, prM and E) and seven nonstructural proteins (NS1, 2A, 2B, 3, 4A, 4B and 5) 3 . DENV proteins are translated as a single polyprotein that is cleaved by cellular and virus-encoded proteases to give rise to individual DENV proteins. Viral RNA replication is accomplished by the multifunctional proteins NS3 and NS5, which copy viral RNA into negative strand templates for subsequent rounds of positive strand RNA amplification. Nascent transcripts are utilized as templates for translation of viral proteins, packaged into newly assembled virions or degraded by cellular enzymes to generate the 3 UTR-derived subgenomic flaviviral RNA (sfRNA) 3,4 . Viral replication occurs in close association with intracellular membranes in part to conceal dsRNA replication intermediates, which can be detected by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and induce a strong innate immune response to infection 5,6 . While several studies suggest that these membranes are derived from the endoplasmic reticulum, the dynamics and precise composition of membranes that support DENV replication are not known 6,7 . Indeed, several studies using the Kunjin strain of WNV demonstrate that Golgi-derived membranes are recruited to replication sites 8, 9 .
