1|chunk|Epithelial cells are a major port of entry for many viruses, but the molecular networks which protect barrier surfaces against viral infections are incompletely understood. Viral infections induce simultaneous production of type I (IFN-/) and type III (IFN-) interferons. All nucleated cells are believed to respond to IFN-/, whereas IFN- responses are largely confined to epithelial cells. We observed that intestinal epithelial cells, unlike hematopoietic cells of this organ, express only very low levels of functional IFN-/ receptors. Accordingly, after oral infection of IFN-/ receptor-deficient mice, human reovirus type 3 specifically infected cells in the lamina propria but, strikingly, did not productively replicate in gut epithelial cells. By contrast, reovirus replicated almost exclusively in gut epithelial cells of IFN- receptordeficient mice, suggesting that the gut mucosa is equipped with a compartmentalized IFN system in which epithelial cells mainly respond to IFN- that they produce after viral infection, whereas other cells of the gut mostly rely on IFN-/ for antiviral defense. In suckling mice with IFN- receptor deficiency, reovirus replicated in the gut epithelium and additionally infected epithelial cells lining the bile ducts, indicating that infants may use IFN- for the control of virus infections in various epithelia-rich tissues. Thus, IFN- should be regarded as an autonomous virus defense system of the gut mucosa and other epithelial barriers that may have evolved to avoid unnecessarily frequent triggering of the IFN-/ system which would induce exacerbated inflammation.
