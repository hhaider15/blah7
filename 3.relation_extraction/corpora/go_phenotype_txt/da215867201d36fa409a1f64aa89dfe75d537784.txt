1|chunk|Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne virus currently transmitted in about 60 countries. CHIKV causes acute flu-like symptoms and in many cases prolonged musculoskeletal and joint pain. Detection of the infection is mostly done using RT-RCR or ELISA, which are not suitable for point-of-care diagnosis.

2|chunk|In this study, a reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA) assay for the detection of the CHIKV was developed. The assay sensitivity, specificity, and crossreactivity were tested. CHIKV RT-RPA assay detected down to 80 genome copies/reaction in a maximum of 15 minutes. It successfully identified 18 isolates representing the three CHIKV genotypes. No cross-reactivity was detected to other alphaviruses and arboviruses except O'nyong'nyong virus, which could be differentiated by a modified RPA primer pair. Seventy-eight samples were screened both by RT-RPA and real-time RT-PCR. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the CHIKV RT-RPA assay were determined at 100%.

3|chunk|The developed RT-RPA assay represents a promising method for the molecular detection of CHIKV at point of need.

4|chunk|CHIKV is transmitted to humans via mosquitos. CHIKV induces clinical signs similar to Influenza, Dengue, and Zika viruses. We have developed a molecular assay for the detection of CHIKV genome based on isothermal"recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) assay"performed at 42C. The result was obtained in maximum of 15 minutes, which is 4-6 times faster than the current molecular diagnostic techniques. Our CHIKV RPA assay is rapid and sensitive, as well as easy to use at the point of need.
