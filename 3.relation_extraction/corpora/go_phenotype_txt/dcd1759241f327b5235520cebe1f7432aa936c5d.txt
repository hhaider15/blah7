The products were resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE and visualised by autoradiography. Molecular size markers were also run on the gel (M). Products derived from ribosomes that do not frameshift (stop) or that enter the 1 frame (-1 FS) are indicated. No specific inhibition or stimulation of frameshifting was seen, although some general inhibition of translation was FIGURE S1: related to Figure 1. Nsp1 does not modulate PRF at established ribosomal frameshifting signals, nor stimulate programmed stop codon readthrough.
