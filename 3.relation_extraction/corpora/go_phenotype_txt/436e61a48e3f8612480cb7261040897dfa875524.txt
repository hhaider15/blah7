1|chunk|A stable culture of primary porcine enterocytes is necessary to study porcine enteric virus replication characteristics. Because the direct cultivation of primary porcine enterocytes is difficult, alternatives have to be considered. As subepithelial myofibroblasts secrete extracellular matrix and growth factors contributing to the attachment, proliferation and differentiation of epithelial cells, co-cultures of primary porcine enterocytes (ileocytes and colonocytes) with myofibroblasts were developed and evaluated for their susceptibility to enteric viruses. First, it was demonstrated that the co-cultured ileocytes and colonocytes were susceptible to an archival rotavirus strain RVA/pig-tc/BEL/RV277/1977/ G1P[7] and different other rotavirus genotypes (fecal samples containing G5P[7], G5P[13], G9P[23], G4P[6]). Next, the TGEV Purdue strain infected both ileocytes and colonocytes whereas the Miller strain only infected ileocytes. Last, the PEDV CV777 Vero adapted and non-adapted (fecal suspension) strains could infect co-cultured ileocytes but not colonocytes. The infectivity of the CV777 Vero adapted strain was higher when the cells were cultured without fetal bovine serum and the CV777 fecal suspension only infected the ileocytes cultured without fetal bovine serum. In conclusion, a novel co-culture of porcine enterocytes with myofibroblasts was established, which can be used for the investigation of the replication of enteric viruses.

2|chunk|Enteric viruses are common causes of diarrhea in humans and animals. Porcine rotavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) are well known enteric viruses, leading to high morbidity and mortality in piglets and causing economic losses in swine-producing countries. Rotavirus belongs to the genus rotavirus within the family Reoviridae. It consists of a triple-layered capsid encapsulating a genome consisting of eleven segments of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) that encodes six structural (VP1-VP4, VP6 and VP7) and six non-structural (NSP1-NSP6) proteins. According to the inner capsid protein VP6, 10 different species/groups (A-J) of rotavirus have been identified using a 53% amino acid cut-off value sequence classification system 1-3 . Rotavirus group A, B, C, E and H have been detected in pig feces 4-8 . The glycoprotein VP7 and the protease-sensitive protein VP4, which elicit neutralizing antibodies, form a genotyping system within the rotavirus A species 9 . Until now, 35 G-genotypes (VP7) and 50 P-genotypes (VP4) were identified. The most prevalent rotavirus group A (RVA) strains in pigs are G3, G4, G5, G9, and G11 in association with P[6], P[7] P[13] and P[23] and the most predominant genotype combination among porcine RVA strains is G5P[7] worldwide 10,11 . Transmissible gastroenteritis virus and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus belong to the group I coronaviruses. They are enveloped viruses with an approximately 28.5 kb single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome encoding four structural proteins: the spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleoprotein (N) protein. The spike protein is the major target for neutralizing antibodies. It mediates the virus binding to the cell surface receptor aminopeptidase N and plays a role in the fusion between the viral envelope and the cell membrane 12,13 . The nucleoprotein wraps the virus genome and supports virus assembly 14 . The membrane protein is mostly embedded in the lipid membrane and plays an important role in the virion architecture 15 .
