1|chunk|CD8 + cytotoxic T cell (CTL) responses are necessary for the lysis of virally infected cells and control of infection. CTLs are activated when their TCRs bind a major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-I/peptide complex on the surface of antigen presenting cells such as macrophages (M). It is now apparent that M display remarkable plasticity in response to environmental signals to polarize into classically activated M(LPS + IFN-) or alternatively activated M(IL-4). However, little is known about how M activation status influences their antigen presentation function to CD8 + T cell in models of virus infection. Consequently, we tested how polarization of spleen-derived (Sp)-M impacts direct presentation of viral antigens to influence effector and proliferative CD8 + T-cell responses. We show that M(IL-4) Sp-M retain MHC-I surface expression and the ability to stimulate IFN- production by CTL following peptide stimulation and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection to levels similar to M0 and M(LPS + IFN-) M. However, memory CD8 + T cells cultured in the presence of M(IL-4) M underwent significantly reduced proliferation and produced similar IFN- levels as coculturing with M0 or M(LPS + IFN-) cells. Thus, these results show a novel ability of polarized M to regulate CD8 + T-cell proliferation and effector functions during virus infection.
