1|chunk|Coronaviruses are of veterinary and medical importance and include highly pathogenic zoonotic viruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. They are known to efficiently evade early innate immune responses, manifesting in almost negligible expression of type-I interferons (IFN-I). This evasion strategy suggests an evolutionary conserved viral function that has evolved to prevent RNA-based sensing of infection in vertebrate hosts. Here we show that the coronavirus endonuclease (EndoU) activity is key to prevent early induction of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) host cell responses. Replication of EndoU-deficient coronaviruses is greatly attenuated in vivo and severely restricted in primary cells even during the early phase of the infection. In macrophages we found immediate induction of IFN-I expression and RNase L-mediated breakdown of ribosomal RNA. Accordingly, EndoU-deficient viruses can retain replication only in cells that are deficient in IFN-I expression or sensing, and in cells lacking both RNase L and PKR. Collectively our results demonstrate that the coronavirus EndoU efficiently prevents simultaneous activation of host cell dsRNA sensors, such as Mda5, OAS and PKR.

2|chunk|Coronaviruses are long known to be particularly successful in evading host innate immune responses. This manifests in barely detectable interferon responses during the first hours of infection and greatly facilitates establishment of robust virus replication. This phenotype of early innate immune evasion is common to all coronaviruses and can have detrimental consequences particular for infections with highly pathogenic coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. We therefore hypothesized that there must be an evolutionary conserved viral function that has evolved to prevent sensing of coronavirus infection by infected host cells. Our study now describes this function, namely the highly conserved coronavirus endoribonuclease activity. We found that coronaviruses that lack this enzymatic activity are readily visible to infected host cells that can now mount a swift and potent host response restricting virus replication within hours. Our study provides a new paradigm of a first layer of RNA virus innate immune evasion during the early phase of infection, that takes place at the site of RNA synthesis, and is based on removal of dsRNA that would otherwise trigger the simultaneous activation of cytoplasmic host cell sensors. Viral endonuclease and innate immunity PLOS Pathogens | Fig 2. EndoU-deficient coronaviruses are severely attenuated in primary macrophages and trigger an elevated IFN-I response. (a) Replication kinetics of MHV-A59 and MHV H277A in C57BL/6 mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) after infection at a MOI of 1, presented as viral titer in pfu. Data represent four independent experiments, each performed in two to four replicas. The difference in peak levels of viral titers (peak MHV-A59: 5.9, peak MHV H277A : 4.8) was statistically significant (***, p<0.001). (b) Replication kinetics of MHV-A59 and MHV H277A (left panel; titers in pfu) and cell-associated viral RNA (right panel; qRT-PCR) following infection of C57BL/6 bone marrow-derived macrophages (MOI = 1). Data represent eight (left panel) or five (right panel) independent experiments, each performed in two to three replicas. The difference in peak levels of viral titers (left panel: peak MHV-A59: 5.3, MHV H277A : 3.3) and the difference in peak levels of RNA copies (right panel: peak MHV-A59: 9.5, MHV H277A : 8.5) were statistically significant (p = 0.002, p = 0.018, respectively). (c) Expression of IFN- mRNA (left panel; qRT-PCR) and protein (right panel; ELISA) in C57BL/6 macrophages following infection of MHV-A59 and MHV H277A (MOI = 1). Expression of IFN- mRNA was normalized to levels of the household genes GAPDH and Tbp and is displayed relative to mock as C T . The IFN- ELISA detection limit is indicated with a dashed line. Data represent seven (left panel) or eight (right panel) independent experiments, each performed in two to three replicas. The difference in peak levels of IFN- mRNA (MHV-A59: 13.4, MHV H277A : 15.8) was statistically significant (p = 0.04). Significance of IFN- protein at 9 h.p.i. was assessed by a two-sided, Wilcoxon matched-pairs test (p = 0.016). (a-c) Mean and SEM are depicted. The 95% confidence band is highlighted in grey. Statistically significant comparisons are displayed; * p < 0.05, ** < 0.01, *** < 0.001. (d) Titers (pfu) of HCoV-229E wild type and HCoV-229E H250A (left panel) and expression of IFN-I (right panel; IFN-I bioassay) in human blood-derived macrophages, 24 hours after infection (MOI = 1). Data represent six (left panel) or seven (right panel) independent experiments, each performed in three to four replicas. Significance was assessed by a two-sided, unpaired Student's t-test (left panel, p<0.001) and a Wilcoxon matched-pairs test (right panel; p = 0.016). (c-d) Mean and SEM are depicted. Statistically significant comparisons are displayed; * p < 0.05, *** < 0.001.
