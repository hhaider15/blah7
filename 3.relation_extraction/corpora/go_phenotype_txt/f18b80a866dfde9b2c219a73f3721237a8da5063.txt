1|chunk|Aging poses an increased risk of severe infection by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The many different biological pathways comprising the response to infection in lungs that are influenced by aging are complex and remain to be defined more thoroughly. Towards finding new directions in research on aging, we aimed to define biological pathways in the acute response to RSV that are affected in the lungs by aging. We therefore profiled the full transcriptome of lung tissue of mice prior to and during RSV infection both at young and old age. In the absence of RSV, we found aging to downregulate genes that are involved in constitution of the extracellular matrix. Moreover, uninfected old mice showed elevated expression of pathways that resemble injury, metabolic aberrations, and disorders mediated by functions of the immune system that were induced at young age only by an exogenous trigger like RSV. Furthermore, infection by RSV mounted stronger activation of anti-viral type-I interferon pathways at old age. Despite such exaggerated anti-viral responses, old mice showed reduced control of virus. Altogether, our findings emphasize important roles in aging-related susceptibility to respiratory disease for extracellular matrix dysfunctions and dysregulated immune activation in lungs.

2|chunk|Old age poses an increased risk for severe disease of the airways caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). In the elderly population it has been estimated that numbers of hospitalization due to RSV infection may reach close to the numbers of respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses 1-3 . In mice, RSV has been shown to cause more lung pathology at old age, but the different mechanisms comprising the response to infection that are influenced by aging of the lung tissue largely remain to be defined. Studies on the full transcriptome in young adult mice have shown that the response to RSV at the site of infection is complex as it involves many different biological pathways 4,5 . Altered antiviral expression of some genes in lung due to aging 6,7 and increased susceptibility to infectious diseases indicate the involvement of unique age-related features that should be considered towards understanding disease at old age. However, effects of aging on the full RSV-induced transcription profile in lungs have remained elusive. In our study, we determined the full transcription profile in the lungs during infection with RSV to provide a more comprehensive exploration of the consequences of old age on gene expression.

3|chunk|Increased susceptibility to disease caused by RSV in the elderly has largely been ascribed to age-related decline of the levels of protective antibodies and memory function of cells of the adaptive immune system resulting in insufficient RSV-specific immunity [8] [9] [10] [11] . Infection due to this lack of acquired RSV-specific immunity implies a prominent role for direct innate anti-viral immune mechanisms that are activated in infected tissue in order to control the virus. A prominent role for innate responses has been exemplified by a study that shows genetic susceptibility to RSV-induced bronchiolitis in children being predominantly associated with innate immune genes 12 . Moreover, these innate genes comprise pro-inflammatory genes, indicating a prominent role for inflammatory
