1|chunk|Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy leads to severe congenital Zika syndrome, which includes microcephaly and other neurological malformations. No therapeutic agents have, so far, been approved for the treatment of ZIKV infection in humans; as such, there is a need for a continuous effort to develop effective and safe antiviral drugs to treat ZIKV-caused diseases. After screening a natural product library, we have herein identified four natural products with anti-ZIKV activity in Vero E6 cells, including gossypol, curcumin, digitonin, and conessine. Except for curcumin, the other three natural products have not been reported before to have anti-ZIKV activity. Among them, gossypol exhibited the strongest inhibitory activity against almost all 10 ZIKV strains tested, including six recent epidemic human strains. The mechanistic study indicated that gossypol could neutralize ZIKV infection by targeting the envelope protein domain III (EDIII) of ZIKV. In contrast, the other natural products inhibited ZIKV infection by targeting the host cell or cell-associated entry and replication stages of ZIKV. A combination of gossypol with any of the three natural products identified in this study, as well as with bortezomib, a previously reported anti-ZIKV compound, exhibited significant combinatorial inhibitory effects against three ZIKV human strains tested. Importantly, gossypol also demonstrated marked potency against all four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV) human strains in vitro. Taken together, this study indicates the potential for further development of these natural products, particularly gossypol, as the lead compound or broad-spectrum inhibitors against ZIKV and other flaviviruses, such as DENV. and fetal death, have been approved. This calls for the development of safe and effective therapeutic agents against ZIKV infection in humans.

2|chunk|The genome of ZIKV encodes a polyprotein, which is then cleaved by cellular and viral proteases to form three structural proteins, including capsid (C), precursor of membrane/membrane (prM/M), and envelope (E), as well as seven nonstructural proteins, including NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5 [8] . The life cycle of ZIKV involves several crucial steps, including viral attachment to target cell receptors or cofactors, receptor-mediated endocytosis (viral entry), virus-endosomal membrane fusion, and postentry or post-translation stages [9, 10] . In this life cycle, E protein plays a key role in viral entry into target cells and subsequent fusion of virus and cell membranes; thus, ZIKV E protein serves as an important therapeutic target against ZIKV infection [11, 12] .

3|chunk|In addition to ZIKV, other flaviviruses, such as DENV, also cause significant problems for humans. Four antigenic serotypes of DENV (DENV-1-4) lead to dengue disease (dengue fever, dengue hemorrhagic fever, or dengue shock syndrome), with cases increasing annually [13, 14] . Therefore, the development of broad-spectrum antiviral inhibitors will be useful for the treatment of infections caused by ZIKV and other flaviviruses, including DENV.

4|chunk|In this study, we have identified four anti-ZIKV inhibitors after screening a natural product library, three of which (gossypol, digitonin, and conessine) have not been reported previously against ZIKV infection. We have demonstrated the broad-spectrum activity of these natural products, particularly gossypol, against multiple ZIKV strains and all four DENV serotypes. We have further identified the mechanisms of action and potential targets of these natural products and revealed the enhanced combinatorial effects of gossypol with other natural products in inhibiting ZIKV infection. Overall, our study opens the door for further exploration and development of the identified natural products as the lead compound or broad-spectrum anti-ZIKV and anti-flavivirus inhibitors.

6|chunk|Vero E6 and LLC-MK2 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 8% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and penicillin and streptomycin (P/S). C6/36 cells (ATCC) were maintained in Eagle's minimal essential medium (EMEM) supplemented with 5% FBS and P/S. ZIKV strains, including human strains PAN2016 (2016/Panama), R116265 (2016/Mexico), PAN2015 (2015/Panama), FLR (2015/Colombia), R103451 (2015/Honduras), PRVABC59 (2015/Puerto Rico), PLCal_ZV (2013/Thailand), and IbH 30656 (1968/Nigeria), mosquito strain MEX 2-81 (2016/Mexico), and rhesus macaque strain MR 766 (1947/Uganda) (Figure 1), were used in the studies. These ZIKV strains were cultured in Vero E6 cells, and viral titers were detected by a standard plaque-forming assay [15]. DENV human strains, including type 1: DENV-1-V1792 (2007/Vietnam), type 2: DENV-2-V594 (2006/Puerto Rico), type 3: DENV-3-V1043 (2006/Puerto Rico), and type 4: DENV-4-PR 06-65-740 (2006/Puerto Rico) (Figure 1), were cultured in C6/36 cells, and the viral titers were determined by plaque-forming assay.
