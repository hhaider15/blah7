Infection in the brain resulted in a limited breadth of the host responses, in accordance with the immunoprivileged status of this organ. Overall, infection with distinct henipavirus strains differed in magnitude of the host responses rather than activation of different pathways. Finally, we propose a model of the pathogenic mechanisms of henipavirus infection that integrates multiple components of the host responses.
