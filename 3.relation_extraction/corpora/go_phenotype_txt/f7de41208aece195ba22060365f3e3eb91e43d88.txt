1|chunk|CoV infection, were co-housed with the vaccinated camels at a ratio of 1:2 (infected:vaccinated); nasal discharge and virus titres were monitored for 14 days. Overall, the vaccination reduced virus shedding and nasal discharge (p = 0.0059 and p = 0.0274, respectively). Antibody responses in seropositive camels were enhancedby the vaccine; these camels had a higher average age than seronegative. Older seronegative camels responded more strongly to vaccination than younger animals; and neutralising antibodies were detected in nasal swabs. Further work is required to optimise vaccine regimens for younger seronegative camels.

2|chunk|Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first identified in 2012 from a pneumonic patient who subsequently died in Saudi Arabia. Since its emergence, the virus has infected more than 2200 individuals in 27 countries 1 . Outbreaks occurred mainly in the Arabian Peninsula in large crowded hospitals with one large outbreak in the Republic of Korea 2 . Although bats have been proposed as a possible natural reservoir of the virus 3 , dromedary camels are the only confirmed animal host so far. More than half (54.9%) of human primary cases have reported contact with camels 4 and the index patient in the Korean outbreak travelled back from the Gulf countries where MERS-CoV is endemic and circulating in dromedary camels 5 . Several studies of camels showed 74-100% seroprevalence rates of MERS-CoV in Africa and the Arabian Peninsula 6-10 . The mean Conversely, vaccinating seropositive camels with ChAdOx1 MERS vaccine (group + V) enhanced S1-specific Ab titre by one log compared to group +C over the three months post vaccination (Fig. 2B ,C and S1C), although both groups had similar baseline levels of Abs (0 d.p.i.). At the time of challenge, both groups had higher levels of S1-specific Abs compared to infectious camels. The fold increase in Ab endpoint titres in seropositive camels is shown in Fig. 2C .

3|chunk|After exposure to infectious camels, Ab levels increased in all groups, except in the + V group, which had the highest level of Abs pre-challenge. Overall, Ab levels in all groups plateaued for nine months post challenge up to 365 d.p.i. After the challenge infection, there was no substantial difference among seronegative camels in group V that received either one or two doses of the vaccine, as indicated by small-range error bars in the Ab titres of V group post challenge (data on 84 to 365 d.p.i., Fig. 2A) .

4|chunk|Levels of nAbs were detected by a pseudotyped virus neutralisation assay (MERSpp NA) at 0, 28 and 365 d.p.i. As shown in Fig. 2D , only groups seropositive prior to vaccination (+C and +V) had nAbs at day 0, with no significant differences between these two groups. Vaccination did not increase these titres at 28 d.p.i.; however the titres in the vaccinated group (+V) were maintained at the same level on days 28 and 365, unlike the non-vaccinated camels that showed decreased nAb titres at 28 and 365 d.p.i.
