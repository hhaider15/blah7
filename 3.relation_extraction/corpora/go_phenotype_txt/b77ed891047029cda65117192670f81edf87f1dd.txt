1|chunk|The spike (S) glycoprotein of the avian gammacoronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is comprised of two subunits (S1 and S2), has a role in virulence in vivo, and is responsible for cellular tropism in vitro. We have previously demonstrated that replacement of the S glycoprotein ectodomain from the avirulent Beaudette strain of IBV with the corresponding region from the virulent M41-CK strain resulted in a recombinant virus, BeauR-M41(S), with the in vitro cell tropism of M41-CK. The IBV Beaudette strain is able to replicate in both primary chick kidney cells and Vero cells, whereas the IBV M41-CK strain replicates in primary cells only. In order to investigate the region of the IBV S responsible for growth in Vero cells, we generated a series of recombinant IBVs expressing chimeric S glycoproteins, consisting of regions from the Beaudette and M41-CK S gene sequences, within the genomic background of Beaudette. The S2, but not the S1, subunit of the Beaudette S was found to confer the ability to grow in Vero cells. Various combinations of Beaudette-specific amino acids were introduced into the S2 subunit of M41 to determine the minimum requirement to confer tropism for growth in Vero cells. The ability of IBV to grow and produce infectious progeny virus in Vero cells was subsequently narrowed down to just 3 amino acids surrounding the S2= cleavage site. Conversely, swapping of the 3 Beaudette-associated amino acids with the corresponding ones from M41 was sufficient to abolish Beaudette growth in Vero cells.

2|chunk|IMPORTANCE Infectious bronchitis remains a major problem in the global poultry industry, despite the existence of many different vaccines. IBV vaccines, both live attenuated and inactivated, are currently grown on embryonated hen's eggs, a cumbersome and expensive process due to the fact that most IBV strains do not grow in cultured cells. The reverse genetics system for IBV creates the opportunity for generating rationally designed and more effective vaccines. The observation that IBV Beaudette has the additional tropism for growth on Vero cells also invokes the possibility of generating IBV vaccines produced from cultured cells rather than by the use of embryonated eggs. The regions of the IBV Beaudette S glycoprotein involved in the determination of extended cellular tropism were identified in this study. This information will enable the rational design of a future generation of IBV vaccines that may be grown on Vero cells.

3|chunk|Coronaviruses are enveloped viruses with an unsegmented, single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome of 26 to 32 kb which is capped and polyadenylated and which replicates in the cell cytoplasm (13-15). The genomic RNA associates with the nucleoprotein (N), forming helical nucleocapsids that are enclosed within lipid envelopes containing the spike (S) glycoprotein, membrane (M) protein, and small envelope (E) protein. The coronavirus S glycoprotein is a highly glycosylated type I membrane glycoprotein that is synthesized as a single polypeptide chain of about 180 kDa that oligomerizes into homotrimers in the endoplasmic reticulum and that is processed in the Golgi apparatus of the host cell (16-18) and is observable as 20-nm structures projecting from the virion surface by electron microscopy. Cryo-electron microscopy has revealed that the S protein forms a clove-shaped trimer of S1 subunits linked to a stalk of trimeric S2 subunits (19-21). The S protein is responsible for binding to the target cell receptor and fusion of the viral and cellular membranes, fulfilling a major role in the infection of susceptible cells (22).

4|chunk|Coronavirus S glycoproteins consist of four domains: an N-terminal signal sequence that is cleaved during synthesis; the ectodomain, which is present on the outside of the virus particle; the transmembrane region, which is responsible for anchoring the S protein into the lipid bilayer of the virus particle; and the cysteine-rich cytoplasmic tail at the C terminus. The S glycoproteins of some coronaviruses, including IBV, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), and human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), are cleaved during biosynthesis into two subunits, S1 and S2, by a furin-like protease in the Golgi apparatus, which remain noncovalently linked (23). The IBV S glycoprotein (1,162 amino acids) is composed of two subunits, S1 (535 amino acids, 90 kDa), comprising the N-terminal half of the S protein, and S2 (627 amino acids, 84 kDa), comprising the C-terminal half of the S protein. As with other coronaviruses, the S2 subunit contains the transmembrane and C-terminal cytoplasmic tail domains and the S1 subunit contains the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S protein (24-27). Proteolytic activation and binding of the S1 subunit to the host cell receptor induce conformational changes in the spike (28, 29) (30), leading to virus-cell fusion and release of the nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm (31). The ectodomain region of the S2 subunit contains a fusion peptide (32-39) and two heptad repeat regions involved in oligomerization of the S protein (40) and is required for entry into susceptible cells (41-43). The spike interacts with the M protein on pre-Golgi membranes, forming multimeric complexes (44), and is incorporated into forming virions (45).

5|chunk|The coronavirus RBD is an independently folded region of the S glycoprotein responsible for interacting with the virus receptor on susceptible host cells. Although all coronavirus RBDs are found within the S1 subunit, they are virus specific and vary in position throughout the S1 domain (46-48). The location of the RBD of IBV has been mapped to be within the N-terminal 253 amino acids of the S1 subunit (49). The host cell receptors for several coronaviruses have been identified; several of the Alphacoronaviruses, porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), type II feline coronavirus (FCoV), canine coronavirus (CCoV), and human coronavirus-229E (HCoV-229E), use aminopeptidase N as the host cell receptor (50-52). In contrast, Betacoronaviruses have been found to utilize a variety of different receptors. The principal receptor for MHV is murine carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule (CEACAM) (53); the virus also attaches to O-acetylated sialic acid, which is mediated by an extra structural protein, the hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) protein found in the virus membrane of some coronaviruses in this genus, rather than the S glycoprotein (54). Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has been shown to use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor (55) along with CD209L (56) and is also thought to use the C-type lectins dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) and L-SIGN as alternative receptors independently of ACE2 (57). The receptor for the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has been identified to be dipeptidyl peptidase 4, also known as CD26 (58). The protein receptor for IBV has not yet been elucidated, although two strains of IBV, M41 and Beaudette, have been shown to use 2,3-linked sialic acid as an attachment factor (59, Bickerton et al.
