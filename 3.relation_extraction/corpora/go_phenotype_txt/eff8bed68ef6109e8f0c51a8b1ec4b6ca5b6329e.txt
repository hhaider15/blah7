1|chunk|Enteric diseases in swine are often caused by different pathogens and thus metagenomics are a useful tool for diagnostics. The capacities of nanopore sequencing for viral diagnostics were investigated here. First, cell culture-grown porcine epidemic diarrhea virus and rotavirus A were pooled and sequenced on a MinION. Reads were already detected at 7 seconds after start of sequencing, resulting in high sequencing depths (19.2 to 103.5X) after 3 h. Next, diarrheic feces of a one-week-old piglet was analyzed. Almost all reads (99%) belonged to bacteriophages, which may have reshaped the piglet's microbiome. Contigs matched Bacteroides, Escherichia and Enterococcus phages. Moreover, porcine kobuvirus was discovered in the feces for the first time in Belgium. Suckling piglets shed kobuvirus from one week of age, but an association between peak of viral shedding (10 6.42 -10 7.01 copies/swab) and diarrheic signs was not observed during a follow-up study. Retrospective analysis showed the widespread (n = 25, 56.8% positive) of genetically moderately related kobuviruses among Belgian diarrheic piglets. MinION enables rapid detection of enteric viruses. Such new methodologies will change diagnostics, but more extensive validations should be conducted. The true enteric pathogenicity of porcine kobuvirus should be questioned, while its subclinical importance cannot be excluded.

2|chunk|Swine health is continuously challenged by viral infections causing enteric, respiratory, reproductive and general systemic diseases. The etiological roles of rotaviruses and coronaviruses (transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV)) in the pathogenesis of piglet diarrhea have been widely accepted 1,2 . However, several novel and poorly characterized viruses are often found in feces of pigs. The clinical importance has not been addressed for most of them and they have not been included in the lists of differential diagnosis for swine veterinarians. Logically, diagnostics are not available for such viruses. Shotgun viral metagenomics allows simultaneous identification of known and novel viruses present in a porcine diagnostic sample. Many studies have already been conducted to elucidate the composition of the fecal virome of pigs, identifying several novel or poorly characterized viruses such as kobuviruses, Published: xx xx xxxx OPEN www.nature.com/scientificreports/
