1|chunk|worldwide. Pathogenic IBV 3575/08 was isolated from broilers vaccinated with the attenuated viral vaccine derived from a Taiwan strain 2575/98. In this study, extensive investigations were conducted on the genome sequences, antigenicity, pathogenicity, and host immune responses of several IBV strains in specific-pathogen-free chickens. Sequence analyses revealed that 3575/08 and 2575/98 shared high homology in their structural genes, but not in non-structural accessory proteins such as 3a, 3b and 5b. Despite a high degree of homology in their spike protein genes, cross neutralization test showed low cross protection between 3575/08 and 2575/98, suggesting distinct antigenicity for the two strains. Animal challenge experiments exhibited strong respiratory and renal pathogenicity for 3575/08. In addition, early and prolonged viral shedding and rapid viral dissemination were observed. Immune gene expression profiling by PCR array showed chickens infected with 3575/08 had delayed expression of a subset of early innate immune genes, whereas chickens infected with the wild-type or attenuatedtype 2575/08 revealed quick gene induction and efficient virus control. In summary, this study reveals a new IBV strain, which harbors a known local genotype but displays remarkably altered antigenicity, pathogenicity and host defenses.

2|chunk|Avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a member of Coronaviridae family, and the virus is responsible for infectious bronchitis, an acute, highly contagious chicken viral disease. Respiratory signs such as coughing, sneezing, and nasal discharge are the primary symptoms associated with IBV infections, and some of the strains also display kidney and oviduct tropisms, causing urogenital symptoms 1-3 . The disease poses economic threat to the poultry industry worldwide. More than 50 serotypes of IBV have been documented since the first isolation of virus in Massachusetts (Mass), US in the 1930 s 2 . The most commonly detected genotype of IBV in the US is Ark-DPI, accounting for 23% to 65% of total isolation per year 4 . While most strains circulating in the US cause respiratory symptoms, nephropathogenic QX-like strains are dominant in Europe 2 . In the Far East, nephropathogenic LX4, LDL as well as proventricular-type QX-like strains have been reported frequently 2 . Presently, vaccination is adopted to manage the disease, and Mass type vaccine H120 is the most widely used vaccine formulation 2,5 . Due to frequent strain variations, however, traditional Mass type vaccines can be ineffective against infections by different IBV variants 2,5,6 . Effective disease management thus demands better elucidation of strain variations.

3|chunk|In Taiwan, viral surveillance from 2005 to 2006 in poultry slaughterhouses showed the IBV flock prevalence was 17% and the chicken prevalence ranged from 1.8 to 3.7% 7 . Most of the IBV isolates in Taiwan are nephropathogenic strains 8, 9 . Also, IBVs in Taiwan are distinct from other genotypes in the world and can be divided into two subgroups, Taiwan Group I (TW-I) and Taiwan Group II (TW-II) 10,11 . As TW-I strains begin to emerge in neighboring areas in recent years 12-14 , there is a rising urgency to thoroughly investigate the TW IBV strains.

4|chunk|IBV virion has a linear, positive sense and single-stranded genomic RNA. Its 27.6 kb genome contains at least ten open reading frames (ORFs), 5 -1a-1ab-S-3a-3b-E-M-5a-5b-N-3 , encoding four structural proteins and several non-structural proteins (nsp) 3 . The four structural proteins include spike glycoprotein (S), envelope protein (E), membrane glycoprotein (M), and nucleocapsid protein (N). Of the different structural proteins, the S protein, which comprises of S1 and S2 subunits, is responsible for host cell attachment and virus-cell membrane fusion and is the primary antigen target for virus neutralization. Currently, genetic grouping for IBV is based primarily on the S1 gene 1-3 . Among the genes that encode for non-structural proteins, the ORF 1a and 1ab encode two polyproteins, which are further cleaved into 15 nsps. These and other non-structural accessory proteins 3a, 3b, 5a and 5b are associated with RNA replication, virulence, and host-pathogen interactions of IBV 3 . However, the functions of these nsps remain largely unknown and warrant further studies.

5|chunk|Host innate antiviral immunity plays a critical role in viral clearance. In general, toll like receptor (TLR) families, retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5, encoded by IFIH1 gene) are intracellular pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) that function as viral infection detectors and all contribute to type I interferon (IFN) production 15 . As RIG-I is absent in chickens, IFIH1 is a functional compensate 16 . Avian TLRs are different from their mammalian counterparts, lacking TLR9 but possessing TLR1LA, poultry-specific TLR15, and a TLR9 homologue TLR21 17 . TLR3 and TLR7 are known to be involved in RNA virus recognition, and its stimulation leads to activation of IRF3 and IRF7 (IFN-regulatory factor 3 and 7) . These factors then signal IFN transcription to trigger IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) through JAK-STAT pathway to express various antiviral proteins 15, 17, 18 . A global gene expression profiling of chicken kidney has revealed that 103 immune and inflammatory-related genes are involved in the host defense response during the first week of IBV infection 19 . The TLR3/7 and MDA5 signaling pathways and innate immune cytokine were induced after IBV infection in chicken tracheas at 3-8 days post IBV M41 infection 20 . In addition, STAT1 expression has also been found to be significantly elevated in response to IBV infection in ovo 21 . However, there is a lack of understanding of early antiviral immune responses induced by various IBV strains, particularly responses triggered by strains with close genetic relationship but distinct pathogenicity.

6|chunk|To control IBV in Taiwan, an embryo-attenuated strain (2575 AT) derived from IBV TW-I strain 2575/98 wild type (2575 WT) has been developed as a vaccine 8 . These two strains were previously investigated to have close antigenicity 8 and limited sequence changes 22 . However, a novel TW-I strain 3575/08 emerged from a broiler chicken farm where the 2575 AT vaccine was applied. IBV 3575/08 has been observed to cause high morbidity and mortality in affected broilers. In the present study, we compared the viral genome sequences of IBV 3575/08 and 2575/98 and investigated the infectivity and host immunity induced by 3575/08, 2575 WT, and 2575 AT infections. To this end, sequence analysis, neutralization test, experimental infection, and immune-related gene profiling were performed. The results show that IBV 3575/08, which possesses heterologous ORF 3a, 3b, and 5b sequences to 2575/98, caused a more deadly infection with early and prolonged viral shedding, stronger clinical and pathological manifestation, and delayed innate immune responses as compared to 2575 WT and 2575 AT.
