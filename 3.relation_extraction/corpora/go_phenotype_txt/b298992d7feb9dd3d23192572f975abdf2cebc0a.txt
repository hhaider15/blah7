1|chunk|OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 mediate hepatic uptake of many drugs (e.g., statins) and can mediate transporter-mediated drug-drug-interactions (DDIs). Bortezomib is the first-in-class proteasome inhibitor drug approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of multiple myeloma. The potential of bortezomib to cause OATP-mediated DDIs has not been assessed. The current study investigated the involvement of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) in OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 degradation and determined the effects of proteasome inhibitors on OATP1B1-and OATP1B3-mediated transport. Co-immunoprecipitation of FLAG-OATP1B1/1B3 and HA-ubiquitin was observed in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells co-transfected with FLAG-tagged OATP1B1/OATP1B3 and hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged ubiquitin, suggesting that OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 can be ubiquitin-modified. Although blocking proteasome activity by bortezomib treatment (50 nM, 7 h) increased the endogenous ubiquitin-conjugated FLAG-OATP1B1 and FLAG-OATP1B3 in HEK293-FLAG-OATP1B1 and-OATP1B3 cells, such treatment did not affect the total protein levels of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, suggesting that the UPS plays a minor role in degradation of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 under current constitutive conditions. Pretreatment with bortezomib (50-250 nM, 2-7 h) significantly decreased transport of [ 3 H]CCK-8, a specific OATP1B3 substrate, in HEK293-OATP1B3 and human sandwich-cultured hepatocytes (SCH). However, bortezomib pretreatment had negligible effects on the transport of [ 3 H] E 2 17G and [ 3 H]pitavastatin, dual substrates of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, in HEK293-OATP1B1/1B3 cells and/or human SCH. Compared with vehicle control treatment, bortezomib pretreatment significantly decreased the maximal transport velocity (V max ) of OATP1B3-mediated transport of CCK-8 (92.25  14.2 vs. 133.95  15.5 pmol/mg protein/ min) without affecting the affinity constant (K m ) values. Treatment with other proteasome inhibitors MG132, epoxomicin, and carfilzomib also significantly decreased OATP1B3mediated [ 3 H]CCK-8 transport.
