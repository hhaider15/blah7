(2019) Distinct transcriptional modules in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells response to human respiratory syncytial virus or to human rhinovirus in hospitalized infants with bronchiolitis. PLoS ONE 14(3): e0213501. https://doi.Viral bronchiolitis is frequent and has an important impact on the children's health care due to the high rates of hospitalization and mortality, especially of young infants [1, 2] . Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) is the predominant etiological agent, but infections by other respiratory viruses, such as human rhinovirus (HRV), metapneumovirus, parainfluenza, influenza, adenovirus, and coronavirus, also occur. These infections with different respiratory virus present similar clinical characteristics, so etiological diagnosis can be carried out in clinical practice only by virus identification, either by molecular tests, immunofluorescence or culture methods [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . Although the current guidelines do not indicate routine tests to identify the etiologic agent in infants with bronchiolitis, the etiological diagnosis may contribute to the prevention of nosocomial acquisition, since the transmission mechanisms diverge among respiratory viruses. Knowledge on molecular epidemiology also contributes to programming and organizing prophylactic strategies, such as the use of monoclonal antibodies to HRSV and influenza vaccination [3, 6] . Etiological diagnosis may also contribute for developing specific therapeutic approaches for each agent.

2|chunk|Clinical and epidemiological evidences indicated that pathogenic pathways are different in HRSV and HRV infections [7] . HRSV is the main agent of bronchiolitis, responsible for high rates of hospitalization and it is a major cause of mortality, especially in premature infants and those with risk factors. Despite this fact, the therapeutic approach consists mainly in supportive measures [3] . HRV is the most common agent of cold and triggering asthma attacks in atopic individuals, however around 35% of asymptomatic subjects have positive results for HRV tests [8] . Serious infections by both agents in early life are associated with recurrent wheezing in the following years, but this association is stronger with HRV. While HRSV infection leads to structural and functional changes in the airways, HRV infections do not cause as many changes and are more related to atopy and asthma [9] . Clinical studies suggest that the use of corticosteroids during the acute phase of infection with high levels of HRV may reduce the risk of recurrent wheezing in the subsequent year [10, 11] .

3|chunk|Differential patient responses to respiratory viruses lead to different clinical outcomes and, interestingly, it has been found that infections with different respiratory viruses (HRSV, HRV, Influenza A), as well as with different genotypes of the same virus (HRSV), present distinctive PBMC transcriptome signatures [12] [13] . Furthermore, PBMC transcriptome profiles can be used to assess disease severity in infants with HRSV [7] and to predict individualized responses to HRV [14] . Thus, besides contributing to clarify the etiology, genomic methods can bring important information on the pathogenic role of the different respiratory virus as single agents, or in codetection, and in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, which is especially important in HRV infections.

4|chunk|In this study, we conducted a comparative global gene expression analysis of PBMC obtained from patients with acute viral bronchiolitis infected by HRSV (HRSV group) or by HRV (HRV group). We employed a weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) which allows the identification of transcriptional modules and their correlation with HRSV or HRV groups. This approach permitted the identification of distinct transcription modules for the HRSV and HRV groups. Moreover, differentially expressed genes in the PBMC expression profiles presented significant high fold-changes between HRSV and HRV groups and could be potential etiological markers.
