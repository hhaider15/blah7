1|chunk|Three new cycloartenol triterpene saponins, named shengmaxinsides A-C, have been isolated from the ethyl acetate soluble fraction of an ethanol extract of Cimicifuga simplex Wormsk roots. Their structures were established by chemical tests and detailed spectroscopic analysis as 25-O-acetyl-7,8-didehydrocimigenol-3-O--D-galactopyranoside (1), 7,8-didehydrocimigenol-3-O--D-galactopyranoside (2) and 7,8-didehydro-24S-Oacetylhydroshengmanol-3-O--D-galactopyranoside (3), respectively.
