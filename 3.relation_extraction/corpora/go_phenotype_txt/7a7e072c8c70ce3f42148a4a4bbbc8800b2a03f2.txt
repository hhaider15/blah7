1|chunk|Arenaviruses are bi-segmented, single-stranded RNA viruses that cause significant human disease. The manner in which they regulate the replication of their genome is not well-understood. This is partly due to the absence of a highly sensitive assay to measure individual species of arenavirus replicative RNAs. To overcome this obstacle, we designed a quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR assay for selective quantitation of each of the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) genomic or antigenomic RNAs. During the course of assay design, we identified a nonspecific priming phenomenon whereby, in the absence of an RT primer, cDNAs complementary to each of the LCMV replicative RNA species are generated during RT. We successfully circumvented this nonspecific priming event through the use of biotinylated primers in the RT reaction, which permitted affinity purification of primer-specific cDNAs using streptavidin-coated magnetic beads. As proof of principle, we used the assay to map the dynamics of LCMV replication at acute and persistent time points and to determine the quantities of genomic and antigenomic RNAs that are incorporated into LCMV particles. This assay can be adapted to measure total S or L segment-derived viral RNAs and therefore represents a highly sensitive diagnostic platform to screen for LCMV infection in rodent and human tissue samples and can also be used to quantify viruscell attachment.

Lassa virus and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), the target virus for this assay, are both Old World arenaviruses. Lassa virus causes Lassa fever along the western coast of Africa [7] while LCMV, which has a worldwide distribution, is responsible for aseptic meningitis [8] . LCMV is also a potent teratogen [9] as well as a highly lethal pathogen in immunosuppressed individuals [10] . In addition, LCMV is the prototypical virus for the family and is widely used as a model organism to study arenavirus replication and pathogenesis, as well as the adaptive immune response to viral infection [8] .

3|chunk|The arenavirus genome consists of two single-stranded RNA segments, L and S, which each encode two proteins in an ambisense manner [11, 12, 13] . The L segment encodes the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L) and the matrix (Z) proteins, while the S segment encodes the nucleoprotein (NP) and the glycoprotein precursor (GPC) proteins. The L and S genomic RNA segments (vRNAs) are packaged within infectious virus particles [14, 15] . Following virion attachment and entry into permissive host cells, the virion-packaged vRNAs, in association with L and NP, are released into the cytoplasm where they serve as templates for both viral genomic replication and transcription (reviewed in [6, 15] ). This process begins with the transcription of the mRNAs for both NP (on the S segment) and L (on the L segment) from the L and S vRNA templates. After transcription of these mRNAs has progressed to a certain point, the viral polymerase begins replication of the vRNAs to generate antigenomic (vcRNA) or full-length, complementary copies of each vRNA segment. These vcRNAs then serve as templates for the generation of additional L and S segment vRNAs as well as transcription of the mRNAs for both GPC (S segment) and Z (L segment). In total, eight different viral RNA species are generated during arenavirus infection: two vRNAs, two vcRNAs, and four mRNAs (see Fig 1) .

4|chunk|LCMV can establish a persistent state of infection in both rodent and in vitro cell culture models (reviewed in [8,16,17]). Infectious virus production typically peaks within the first few days of infection, followed by a marked drop in GPC expression as well as release of infectious virus during persistence [18, 19] . Infectious virus production, while low during persistence, can also be quite cyclical [20, 21, 22] . The mechanism(s) by which LCMV regulates the replication and transcription of its genome over the course of infection and the specific details regarding the dynamics of this process are not fully understood. One tool that is needed to address these outstanding questions is a highly sensitive assay to distinguish and quantitate each of the LCMV replicative RNA species. In the current study, we developed a strand-specific, quantitative (Q)RT-PCR assay for quantification of LCMV S and L segment vRNA and vcRNA. We also describe a phenomenon whereby LCMV RNA species are, in the absence of a virus-specific RT primer, nonspecifically primed for cDNA synthesis during RT reactions and a means to circumvent this nonspecific priming for accurate measurement of individual viral RNA species. We used the assay to evaluate LCMV genome replication at acute and persistent time points and also to determine the viral RNA content of purified virions. This assay will enable studies of the dynamics and efficiency of LCMV replication and also provide a highly sensitive diagnostic platform for measurement of total S and L segment-derived viral RNA species.
