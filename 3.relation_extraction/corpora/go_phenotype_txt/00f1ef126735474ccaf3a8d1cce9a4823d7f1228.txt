1|chunk|This is one of the few examples in which the diverse products have been synthesized just by changing the applied potential. The synthesis of sulfonyl derivatives of p-methylaminophenol were carried out by reaction of the electrogenerated p-methylquinoneimine with sulfinic acids. Various types of mono (MSP), bis (BSP) and tris (TSP) sulfonyl p-methyl aminophenols were obtained by changing the electrode potential, in one pot under green conditions. The mono sulfonyl-p-(methylamino)phenol derivatives (MSP) were assessed for their in vitro antibacterial activity against the gram positive (Staphylococcus aureus) and gram negative (Escherichia coli) strains. It was found that the tested compounds were more active against Staphylococcus aureus than Escherichia coli. We also found that the antimicrobial activity of MSP derivatives to vary in the order MSP 4 (R = CH 3 ) > MSP 1 (R = p-tolyl)  MSP 2 (R = phenyl) > MSP 3 (R = p-ClC 6 H 4 ). Moreover, the observed homogeneous rate constants (k obs ) of the reaction of p-methyl quinoneimine with sulfinic acids were estimated in various pH values, based on the EC and ECEC mechanisms, by comparing the simulated cyclic voltammograms with the experimental ones.

2|chunk|The control of selectivity is one of the important challenges in organic syntheses 1-6 . To overcome to this problem, a number of organic and metal catalyst systems has been examined 1-6 . However, they have the disadvantages of safety problems and heavy metal pollution. Organic electrochemical synthesis provides a powerful strategy for the synthesis of organic compounds in both laboratory and industry scale 7-13 . In this method, the electrons are considered as clean reagents, so that this method can be considered as a green technique. Another important feature of this method, which is used in this work, is its selectivity towards synthesis of products. This unique feature arises from the fact that, the different active intermediates can be provided just by changing the electrode potential 7-13 .

3|chunk|p-Aminophenol is commercially significant as a versatile intermediate in the manufacture of chemical dye, drugs such as acetaminophen, photographic developer and anticorrosion agents 14-17 . In particular, it is known that some aminophenol derivatives have antiviral activity against flu A and simple herpes 18 . It is also known that, the aminophenols containing a sulphone group in addition to activity against flu A and simple herpes have excellent activity against the HIV infection 19 . On the other hand, it is found that, diphenylsulfone compounds exhibited antibacterial activity 20 . For example, 4,4-diaminodiphenylsulfone (dapsone) is a bacteriostatic drug that inhibits dihydrofolic acid synthesis by competition with para-aminobenzoic acid 21 . The oxidation of sulfides or sulfoxides using peracids or hydrogen peroxide, addition reactions to alkenes and alkynes, Friedel-Crafts-type sulfonylation of arenes in the presence of a Lewis or Brnsted acid catalyst, and alkylation of sulfinate salts, are four traditional methods for the synthesis of sulfones 22 . The excess oxidizing agent, high temperatures, harsh reaction conditions, low regioselectivity, the need for stoichiometric amounts of the catalyst, the generation of hazardous waste and formation of a mixture of isomers are the main disadvantages of these methods 23-27 .
