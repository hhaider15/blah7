0|chunk|S1 Text Simulation Algorithm

1|chunk|Here we describe an algorithm for simulating epidemics from our proposed individual model. Consider the situation where there is one infectious individual at current time t (i.e. the time of this individual transits from class E to class I) among an entirely susceptible population. The simulation proceeds as follows:
