1|chunk|The phosphorylation of eIF4E plays a critical role in controlling protein translation. Results: MNV1 infection results in activation of p-eIF4E, its relocation to polysomes, and translational regulation. Conclusion: MNV1 manipulates the host cell translation machinery by controlling eIF4E activity. Significance: Regulation of cellular response to infection may contribute to viral pathogenesis and persistence. 4 The abbreviations used are: VPg, viral protein, genome-linked; MNV, murine norovirus; FCV, feline calicivirus; eIF, eukaryotic initiation factor; 4E-BP, eIF4E-binding protein; TCID 50 , 50% tissue culture infectious dose; MOI, multiplicity of infection; hpi, hours postinfection; p-eIEF4E, phosphorylated eIF4E; qPCR, quantitative PCR.
