1|chunk|The Picornaviridae family comprises a large group of non-enveloped viruses that have a major impact on human and veterinary health. The viral genome contains one open reading frame encoding a single polyprotein that can be processed by viral proteinases. The crucial 3C proteinases (3C pro s) of picornaviruses share similar spatial structures and it is becoming apparent that 3C pro plays a significant role in the viral life cycle and virus host interaction. Importantly, the proteinase and RNA-binding activity of 3C pro are involved in viral polyprotein processing and the initiation of viral RNA synthesis. In addition, 3C pro can induce the cleavage of certain cellular factors required for transcription, translation and nucleocytoplasmic trafficking to modulate cell physiology for viral replication. Due to interactions between 3C pro and these essential factors, 3C pro is also involved in viral pathogenesis to support efficient infection. Furthermore, based on the structural conservation, the development of irreversible inhibitors and discovery of non-covalent inhibitors for 3C pro are ongoing and a better understanding of the roles played by 3C pro may provide insights into the development of potential antiviral treatments. In this review, the current knowledge regarding the structural features, multiple functions in the viral life cycle, pathogen host interaction, and development of antiviral compounds for 3C pro is summarized.

3|chunk|In this review, we summarize how 3C pro is involved in polyprotein processing, protein-primed RNA synthesis initiation and the switch from viral translation to replication. We discuss the multiple roles that 3C pro plays in the host cells, including shutting off transcription, inhibiting protein synthesis, blocking nucleocytoplasmic transport and inducing cell death. In addition, we also compare the functions of 3C pro in the pathogenesis process of different picornaviruses. Discoveries have recently been made concerning effective and broad-spectrum inhibitors of picornaviruses. As a protease inhibitor for rhinovirus (RV) 3C pro , rupintrivir (AG7088) has been the subject of clinical trials [7], however, AG7088 failed in a natural infection study [8] . Efforts to develop effective antiviral compounds are still ongoing. The synthesis of AG7088 analogues, the exploration of non-covalent inhibitors and research on natural medicine are the main strategies currently being used to develop 3C pro inhibitors (3CPIs).
