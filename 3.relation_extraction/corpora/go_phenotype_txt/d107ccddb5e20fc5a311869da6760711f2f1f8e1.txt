1|chunk|A novel series of {4-[(2-amino-6-chloro-9H-purin-9-yl)methyl]-1H-1,2,3-triazol-1-yl}alkylphosphonates and {4-[(2-amino-6-oxo-1,6-dihydro-9H-purin-9-yl)methyl]-1H-1,2,3triazol-1-yl}alkylphosphonates as acyclic analogues of guanosine were synthesized and assessed for antiviral activity against a broad range of DNA and RNA viruses and for their cytostatic activity toward three cancerous cell lines (HeLa, L1210 and CEM). They were devoid of antiviral activity; however, several phosphonates were found slightly cytostatic against HeLa cells at an IC50 in the 80-210 M range. Compounds (1R,2S)-17k and (1S,2S)-17k showed the highest inhibitory effects (IC50 = 15-30 M) against the proliferation of murine leukemia (L1210) and human T-lymphocyte (CEM) cell lines.
