1|chunk|Nuclear factor-B (NF-B) is an important transcription factor that induces the expression of antiviral genes and viral genes. NF-B activation needs the activation of NF-B upstream molecules, which include receptors, adaptor proteins, NF-B (IB) kinases (IKKs), IB, and NF-B dimer p50/p65. To survive, viruses have evolved the capacity to utilize various strategies that inhibit NF-B activity, including targeting receptors, adaptor proteins, IKKs, IB, and p50/p65. To inhibit NF-B activation, viruses encode several specific NF-B inhibitors, including NS3/4, 3C and 3C-like proteases, viral deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), phosphodegron-like (PDL) motifs, viral protein phosphatase (PPase)-binding proteins, and small hydrophobic (SH) proteins. Finally, we briefly describe the immune evasion mechanism of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) by inhibiting NF-B activity in productive and latent infections. This paper reviews a viral mechanism of immune evasion that involves the suppression of NF-B activation to provide new insights into and references for the control and prevention of viral diseases.

The innate immune system is the first line of defense against foreign pathogens. NF-B plays a major role in innate immune responses by inducing antiviral genes, such as interferon (IFN) and IFN-stimulated genes (ISG). Additionally, NF-B also promotes viral gene transcription that is harmful to some viruses' latency. Therefore, over the long course of evolution, viruses have developed multiple methods that interfere with NF-B activity to promote viral survival.

Additionally, we describe several specific NF-B inhibitors, including NS3/4, 3C and 3C-like proteases, viral deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), phosphodegron-like (PDL) motifs, viral protein phosphatase (PPase)-binding proteins, and small hydrophobic (SH) proteins. To better understand the role of NF-B in viral immune escape, we use human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) as an example, and describe how inhibiting NF-B activity promotes HIV-1 immune escape in different viral life cycles: productive infection and latent infection. We hope that this review can provide a reference for the prevention and control of viral diseases.

When cellular receptors sense external stimuli, they transmit signals to the IKKs via adaptor proteins, resulting in the phosphorylation of IKKs, degradation of IB, nuclear transfer of p50/p65, and activation of NF-B.

When cellular receptors sense external stimuli, they transmit signals to the IKKs via adaptor proteins, resulting in the phosphorylation of IKKs, degradation of IB, nuclear transfer of p50/p65, and activation of NF-B. Figure 1 . The activation of the NF-B. The major upstream receptors of NF-B-TLRs, RIG-I, TNFR, and IL-1R1-sense external stimuli and transmit signals to their adaptor proteins. TLRs transmit signals to MyD88 or TRIF, RIG-I to MAVS, TNFR1 to receptor interacting protein 1 (RIP1), and IL-1R to MyD88. Then, MyD88 activates interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinases (IRAKs) and TNFRassociated factor 6 (TRAF6), MAVS interacts with TRAF6, and TRIF interacts with RIP1. TRAF6 and RIP1 both activate the transforming growth factor (TGF)--activated kinase 1 (TAK1) complex. The activated TAK1 complex then activates IKKs, resulting in the phosphorylation and degradation of IB and the release of p50/p65. The released p50/p65 enters the nucleus, binds specific DNA sequences, and activates NF-B transcriptional activity.
