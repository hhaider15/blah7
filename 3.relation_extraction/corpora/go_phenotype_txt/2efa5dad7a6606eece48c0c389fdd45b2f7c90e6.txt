0|chunk|cells Viroporins in the Influenza Virus

1|chunk|Influenza is a highly contagious virus that causes seasonal epidemics and unpredictable pandemics. Four influenza virus types have been identified to date: A, B, C and D, with only A-C known to infect humans. Influenza A and B viruses are responsible for seasonal influenza epidemics in humans and are responsible for up to a billion flu infections annually. The M2 protein is present in all influenza types and belongs to the class of viroporins, i.e., small proteins that form ion channels that increase membrane permeability in virus-infected cells. In influenza A and B, AM2 and BM2 are predominantly proton channels, although they also show some permeability to monovalent cations. By contrast, M2 proteins in influenza C and D, CM2 and DM2, appear to be especially selective for chloride ions, with possibly some permeability to protons. These differences point to different biological roles for M2 in types A and B versus C and D, which is also reflected in their sequences. AM2 is by far the best characterized viroporin, where mechanistic details and rationale of its acid activation, proton selectivity, unidirectionality, and relative low conductance are beginning to be understood. The present review summarizes the biochemical and structural aspects of influenza viroporins and discusses the most relevant aspects of function, inhibition, and interaction with the host.

2|chunk|In IAV, the viral envelope contains cholesterol-enriched lipid rafts and transmembrane glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) [14] , which are used to further classify IAV strains. A third membrane protein is matrix protein 2 (AM2 in IAV), present in lower abundance [15] . HA, NA, and M2 are type I, type II, and type III membrane proteins, respectively [16] [17] [18] . A layer of matrix protein 1 (M1) just underneath the membrane is the most abundant protein of the virus. M1 forms an internal coat, enclosing the viral ribonucleoproteins as well as three polymerase proteins (PA, PB1, and PB2) that form the viral RNA polymerase complex [19] .

3|chunk|IAV and IBV have eight negative-sense RNA segments, each encoding one or two viral proteins. IAV encodes 10-11 proteins: HA, NA, NP, M1, M2, PA, PB1, PB2, NS1, NS2, and PB1-F2 [19] . IBV has the same proteins as IAV, except for the PB1-F2 protein, and has an additional surface glycoprotein NB that is unique to flu B. ICV and IDV consist of only seven gene segments each, and they do not encode envelope glycoproteins HA and NA. Instead, they carry only one glycoprotein, HEF (haemagglutinin-esterase fusion), which combines the functions of HA and NA [20] .

4|chunk|M2, PB1-F2, and NB proteins are classified as viroporins, i.e., virus-encoded short polypeptides (approximately 60-120 amino acids) that have one, two, or even three [21] transmembrane (TM) -helical domains. These polypeptides form oligomers of typically four to six monomers that permeabilize membranes to ions [22] [23] [24] .

5|chunk|AM2 and BM2

6|chunk|The RNA segment 7 from IAV encodes both the M1 protein and AM2 proton channel via alternative splicing [25, 26] . AM2 is 97-residues long and forms a channel assembled by the tetramerization of four left-handed TM helices stabilized by disulfide bridges [18, 27] . The AM2 monomer consists of an N-terminal ectodomain (residues 1-24), an -helical (TM) domain (residues 25-46), and a C-terminal cytoplasmic tail (CT) domain (residues 47-97) that contains a highly conserved amphipathic helix (APH) (residues 51-59) [25, 28] .

7|chunk|AM2 forms an acid-activated proton channel with an asymmetrical preference of proton conduction from the viral exterior (N-terminus) to the interior (C-terminus). The proton channel activity of AM2 is essential for two important roles. Upon viral entry into cells via sialic acid-containing receptor-mediated endocytosis, the low pH (5 to 6) of late endosomes activates the proton channel activity of AM2, which acidifies the viral interior [25] with subsequent detachment of M1 from the vRNP complex. This enables trafficking of vRNPs into the host cell nucleus for synthesis of mRNA and vRNA [29, 30] . The channel activity of M2 is also crucial during viral maturation, where it equilibrates the pH across the trans-Golgi membrane to prevent the viral HA from undergoing premature conformational change while being transported to the plasma membrane of infected cells [31] [32] [33] [34] . Conductance and inhibition studies have used the transmembrane domain of AM2 (AM2-TM), since in Xenopus oocytes AM2(21-51) has retained the proton selectivity and drug sensitivity observed in full-length AM2 protein [35] .

8|chunk|Four main features characterize AM2-facilitated membrane permeabilization to protons: acid activation, proton selectivity, relative low proton conductance, and unidirectionality. These features are encoded in key pore-lining residues of the AM2 channel. AM2 has a conserved HxxxW functional motif in its TM domain (Figure 1) , where His37 is responsible for proton selectivity and acid activation [36] , and Trp41 ensures asymmetric proton conduction from the N-terminus to the C-terminus [37] . Other residues surrounding this motif also contribute to the dynamics and proton transfer equilibria in the channel.
