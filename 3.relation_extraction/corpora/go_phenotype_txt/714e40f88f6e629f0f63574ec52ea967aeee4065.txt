1|chunk|Foamy viruses (FV) belong to the genus Spumavirus, which forms a distinct lineage in the Retroviridae family. Although the infection in natural hosts and zoonotic transmission to humans is asymptomatic, FVs can replicate well in human cells making it an attractive gene therapy vector candidate. Here we present cryo-electron microscopy and (cryo-)electron tomography ultrastructural data on purified prototype FV (PFV) and PFV infected cells. Mature PFV particles have a distinct morphology with a capsid of constant dimension as well as a less ordered shell of density between the capsid and the membrane likely formed by the Gag N-terminal domain and the cytoplasmic part of the Env leader peptide gp18 LP . The viral membrane contains trimeric Env glycoproteins partly arranged in interlocked hexagonal assemblies. In situ 3D reconstruction by subtomogram averaging of wild type Env and of a Env gp48 TM -gp80 SU cleavage site mutant showed a similar spike architecture as well as stabilization of the hexagonal lattice by clear connections between lower densities of neighboring trimers. Cryo-EM was employed to obtain a 9  resolution map of the glycoprotein in its pre-fusion state, which revealed extensive trimer interactions by the receptor binding subunit gp80 SU at the top of the spike and three central helices derived from the fusion protein subunit gp48 TM . The lower part of Env, presumably composed of interlaced parts of gp48 TM , gp80 SU and gp18 LP anchors the spike at the membrane. We propose that the gp48 TM density continues into three central transmembrane helices, which interact with three outer transmembrane helices derived from gp18 LP . Our ultrastructural data and 9  resolution glycoprotein structure provide important new insights into the molecular architecture of PFV and its distinct evolutionary relationship with other members of the Retroviridae.

3|chunk|Foamy viruses (FVs), which belong to the retroviral genus Spumavirus, are endemic to non-human primates and can be transmitted to humans. They are considered as potential vectors for gene therapy due to their broad cell tropism and their apparent apathogenicity in natural hosts and humans. In order to gain more insight into the ultrastructure of the prototype FV (PFV) we performed (cryo-)electron tomography and microscopy of infected cells and of isolated virions. We find that PFV contains a nucleocapsid of constant dimensions at its center, an intermediate shell of protein positioned between the core capsid and the viral membrane and glycoprotein that arranges into regular hexagonal lattices on the virus membrane. Structural analysis of the glycoprotein was performed in situ to a resolution of 9, which shows regular helical features such as a trimeric coiled coil of the fusion protein subunit, a hallmark of class I fusion proteins, spacer arms between the glycoprotein trimers and the arrangement of six transmembrane helices, a characteristic feature of the PFV Env glycoprotein. We discuss our results in light of the evolutionary relationship of PFV with other retroviruses as well as the role of the unique glycoprotein architecture on the virus life cycle.
