1|chunk|Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) virus (PRRSV) infections are characterized by prolonged viremia and viral shedding consistent with incomplete immunity. Type I interferons (IFN) are essential for mounting efficient antiviral innate and adaptive immune responses, but in a recent study, North American PRRSV genotype 2 isolates did not induce, or even strongly inhibited, IFN- in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC), representing "professional IFN--producing cells". Since inhibition of IFN- expression might initiate PRRSV pathogenesis, we further characterized PRRSV effects and host modifying factors on IFN- responses of pDC. Surprisingly, a variety of type 1 and type 2 PRRSV directly stimulated IFN- secretion by pDC. The effect did not require live virus and was mediated through the TLR7 pathway. Furthermore, both IFN- and IL-4 significantly enhanced the pDC production of IFN- in response to PRRSV exposure. PRRSV inhibition of IFN- responses from enriched pDC stimulated by CpG oligodeoxynucleotides was weak or absent. VR-2332, the prototype genotype 2 PRRSV, only suppressed the responses by 34%, and the highest level of suppression (51%) was induced by a Chinese highly pathogenic PRRSV isolate. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that pDC respond to PRRSV and suggest that suppressive activities on pDC, if any, are moderate and strain-dependent. Thus, pDC may be a source of systemic IFN- responses reported in PRRSV-infected animals, further contributing to the puzzling immunopathogenesis of PRRS.
