1|chunk|A large number of human genes associated with viral infections contain single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which represent a genetic variation caused by the change of a single nucleotide in the DNA sequence. SNPs are located in coding or non-coding genomic regions and can affect gene expression or protein function by different mechanisms. Furthermore, they have been linked to multiple human diseases, highlighting their medical relevance. Therefore, the identification and analysis of this kind of polymorphisms in the human genome has gained high importance in the research community, and an increasing number of studies have been published during the last years. As a consequence of this exhaustive exploration, an association between the presence of some specific SNPs and the susceptibility or severity of many infectious diseases in some risk population groups has been found. In this review, we discuss the relevance of SNPs that are important to understand the pathology derived from influenza A virus (IAV) infections in humans and the susceptibility of some individuals to suffer more severe symptoms. We also discuss the importance of SNPs for IAV vaccine effectiveness. multiple mechanisms, although there are some differences between strains. For that genome plasticity, IAV take advantage of multiple strategies, such as alternative splicing, frameshift mechanisms, and overlapping open reading frames (ORFs) [7] [8] [9] . In addition, the coding capability of the viral genome is extended by encoding multifunctional proteins that act at different steps during virus infection. of synthetized vRNP, ensuring that the vRNPs are available for packaging [24] . Moreover, NEP has also other functions during IAV infection, contributing to viral budding and to regulate viral RNA synthesis. NS1 is a multifunctional protein and a key viral factor that counteracts the host antiviral responses. NS1 has been shown to inhibit the production of interferon (IFN), the activity and expression of multiple interferon-induced genes (ISG) and the processing and nuclear transport of host mRNAs causing cellular shut-off [25, 26] . Segment 3 of IAV also encodes two proteins, the polymerase component PA and PA-X. PA is translated directly from the PA mRNA, whereas PA-X is translated using a +1 frameshift mechanism from the same open reading frame (ORF) [9] . Synergistically with NS1, PA-X is also able to block the cellular antiviral responses by inhibiting host protein expression. Moreover, the PA-X protein has been shown to modulate host inflammation, immune responses, apoptosis, and virus pathogenesis [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] .
