1|chunk|Background: The major structural protein of coronaviruses, the membrane (M) protein, can elicit the formation of protective antibodies, but little information is available about the M protein of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). Identification of epitopes on the PEDV M protein will be helpful in the elucidation of the antigenic properties of this protein.

2|chunk|Results: One hybridoma cell line secreting anti-M protein monoclonal antibody (McAb) was generated and designated 4D4. To map the epitopes on the PEDV M protein, a total of 17 partially overlapping fragments covering the C-terminus of M protein were expressed as fusion proteins with a 6His tag or a GST tag. A linear motif, 193 TGWAFYVR 200 , was identified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and western blot (WB) analysis using McAb 4D4. The motif 195 WAFYVR 200 was the minimal requirement for reactivity, as demonstrated by removing amino acids individually from both ends of the motif 193 TGWAFYVR 200 . The result of WB analysis showed that the 4D4-defined epitope could be recognized by PEDV-positive serum, but not transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV)-positive serum. Furthermore, this epitope was highly conserved among different PEDV strains, as shown by alignment and comparison of sequences.
