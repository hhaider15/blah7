1|chunk|The genome of influenza A virus (IAV) comprises eight RNA segments (vRNA) which are transcribed and replicated by the heterotrimeric IAV RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp). RdRp consists of three subunits (PA, PB1 and PB2) and binds both the highly conserved 3-and 5-ends of the vRNA segment. The IAV RdRp is an important antiviral target, but its structural mechanism has remained largely elusive to date. By applying a polyprotein strategy, we produced RdRp complexes and define a minimal human IAV RdRp core complex. We show that PA-PB1 forms a stable heterodimeric submodule that can strongly interact with 5-vRNA. In contrast, 3-vRNA recognition critically depends on the PB2 N-terminal domain. Moreover, we demonstrate that PA-PB1 forms a stable and stoichiometric complex with host nuclear import factor RanBP5 that can be modelled using SAXS and we show that the PA-PB1-RanPB5 complex is no longer capable of 5-vRNA binding. Our results provide further evidence for a step-wise assembly of IAV structural components, regulated by nuclear transport mechanisms and host factor binding.

2|chunk|The influenza virus is a negative sense RNA virus with a segmented genome belonging to the Orthomyxoviridae family. The viral RNA (vRNA) is divided into 8 segments that encode for a total of 10 core proteins and a few additional accessory proteins. Every vRNA segment is coated by numerous nucleoprotein (NP) units and by one RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) complex composed of PA (716 aa for influenza A virus (IAV) strains), PB1 (756 aa for IAV strains) and PB2 (757aa for IAV strains). The RdRp binds to the 5-and 3-terminal extremities of the vRNA which acts as a promoter region 1-3 . The macromolecular assembly between the vRNA, NP and the RdRp forms the ribonucleoprotein (RNP). The RdRp performs both replication and transcription of the vRNA genome in the nucleus of the cell. As such, the RdRp can produce either cRNA/vRNA through de novo replication or viral mRNA through "cap snatching" transcription 4 . The factors regulating the switch from a transcriptive to a replicative RdRp remain to be characterised.

3|chunk|Recently, the structures of influenza B 5 , bat influenza A 6 and influenza C 7 were published, providing tremendous insight into the complex architecture of the RdRp. All three subunits are tightly intertwined and form intricate quaternary structures at the vRNA promoter binding sites. Current models of RdRp assembly suggest that PB2 is imported via the importin- pathway 8,9 whereas the PA-PB1 heterodimer is imported through direct interaction with RanBP5 10-12 .
