1|chunk|Background: Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a highly effective pathogen that can cause death of newborn piglet, resulting in big economical loss in pig farming industry. For rapid detection of PEDV, a new immunochromatographic assay (ICA) based on monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) was developed in this study. Results: The mAbs were prepared by using PEDV positive hybridoma cells that were selected by using cell surface fluorescence immunosorbent assay (CSFIA). Fourteen mAbs against PEDV strain isolated from south of China were prepared. The optimal mAb 4A11 was coated on NC membrane as the capturing reagent and the mAb A11H7 was coupled to gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) as detection reagent for the new ICA. The new ICA was used to measure PEDV in phosphate buffer containing tween-20. Results indicated that the limit of detection (LOD) of the new ICA was 0.47 g/mL (5.9  10 3 TCID 50 /mL) and the liner detection range of the ICA was 0.625-10 g/mL (7.8  10 3 -10 5 TCID 50 /mL). The specificity analysis results showed that this new ICA had no cross reaction in the presence of other porcine viruses. The ICA was also validated for the detection of PEDV in swine stool samples with little interference from swine stool. To compare its accuracy to other traditional detection methods, 27 swine stool samples from south of China were investigated with the new developed ICA, commercial strip and RT-PCR. Results showed that the new ICA was more comparable to RT-PCR than commercial test strip.
