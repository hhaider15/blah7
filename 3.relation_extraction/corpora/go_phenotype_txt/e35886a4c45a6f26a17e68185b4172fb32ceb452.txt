1|chunk|Surface protein hemagglutinin (HA) mediates the binding of influenza virus to host cell receptors containing sialic acid, facilitating the entry of the virus into host cells. Therefore, the HA protein is regarded as a suitable target for the development of influenza virus detection devices. In this study, we isolated single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) aptamers binding to the HA1 subunit of subtype H1 (H1-HA1), but not to the HA1 subunit of subtype H5 (H5-HA1), using a counter-systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (counter-SELEX) procedure. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and surface plasmon resonance studies showed that the selected aptamers bind tightly to H1-HA1 with dissociation constants in the nanomolar range. Western blot analysis demonstrated that the aptamers were binding to H1-HA1 in a concentration-dependent manner, yet were not binding to H5-HA1. Interestingly, the selected aptamers contained G-rich sequences in the central random nucleotides region. Further biophysical analysis showed that the G-rich sequences formed a G-quadruplex structure, which is a distinctive structure compared to the starting ssDNA library. Using flow cytometry analysis, we found that the aptamers did not bind to the receptor-binding site of H1-HA1. These results indicate that the selected aptamers that distinguish H1-HA1 from H5-HA1 can be developed as unique probes for the detection of the H1 subtype of influenza virus.

4|chunk|Hemagglutinin is the most abundant protein on the viral surface and displays epitopes that trigger neutralizing antibody production. It is initially synthesized as a precursor HA0 protein, which is proteolytically cleaved into HA1 and HA2 subunits [6] . In the mature HA homotrimer of approximately 220 kDa, HA2 is embedded in the viral membrane, whereas HA1 mediates the binding to the host cell surface [7] . Infection is initiated by binding of HA1 to sialic acid on the membranes of respiratory epithelial cells [8] , which makes HA1 a primary target for the development of antiviral agents and diagnostics [9, 10] . Thus far, diagnostic methods for the detection of influenza virus infections were mainly based on reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) [11, 12] , enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) [13] , and real-time PCR (qPCR) [14] .

5|chunk|Aptamers are nucleic acids binding to specific target molecules with high affinities, produced by systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) [15] . Thus far, aptamers have been developed for a wide range of purposes such as biosensors, medical diagnosis, and therapy [16, 17] . In order to improve aptamer production, enhanced versions of SELEX were established, such as counter-SELEX, toggle-SELEX, cell-SELEX, and others [18] . Using counter-SELEX methods, the Polisky group created an RNA aptamer that could distinguish between theophylline and caffeine, differing by only one methyl group [19] , while the Famulok group made aptamers discriminating between cytohesin-1 and cytohesin-2 [20]. As these and other previous studies indicated, aptamers generated by counter-SELEX can discern minute differences between targets of closely related structures [21, 22] . Based on this sensitivity, it can be assumed that aptamers selected by counter-SELEX might be ideal diagnostic tools for differentiating between HA subtypes.

6|chunk|In the current study, we used counter-SELEX to isolate ssDNA aptamers that distinguish between H1-HA1 protein and H5-HA1 protein. The selected ssDNA aptamers showed high binding affinities to H1-HA1 in vitro, yet did not block the sialic acid-binding region of HA1. Based on the power of discrimination between such closely related structures, it is suggested that aptamers are the probes of choice for the detection of influenza subtypes.

8|chunk|A library of DNA molecules composed of two primer regions and a 45-nucleotide random region was prepared, and ssDNAs were generated as previously described, with slight modifications [23] . All synthetic DNAs were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT, Coralville, IA,). Asymmetric PCR reactions (100 L) were set up with a molar primer ratio of 100:1 (forward primer:reverse primer), and contained 0.2 mM dNTPs, 1 M forward primer, 10 nM 5 0 -phosphorylated reverse primer, 10 nM template, and 2.5 U Taq DNA polymerase. The mixture was thermally cycled 20 times at 95C for 1 min, 52C for 30 s, and 72C for 45 s, followed by a 7 min extension step at 72C. After PCR, purified dsDNA was incubated with 25 U of lambda exonuclease (NEB, Frankfurt am Main, Germany) at 37C for 3 h. The reaction was terminated by incubation at 75C for 10 min. The products of the digested strand were analyzed by electrophoresis in a 10% polyacrylamide/8 M urea TBE gel, and ssDNA was purified from the gel for the next round of selection.
