0|chunk|Cdrom Archive: A Gateway to Study Camel Phenotypes

1|chunk|Camels are livestock that exhibit unique morphological, biochemical, and behavioral traits, which arose by natural and artificial selection. Investigating the molecular basis of camel traits has been limited by: (1) the absence of a comprehensive record of morphological trait variation (e.g., diseases) and the associated mode of inheritance, (2) the lack of extended pedigrees of specific trait(s), and (3) the long reproductive cycle of the camel, which makes the cost of establishing and maintaining a breeding colony (i.e., monitoring crosses) prohibitively high. Overcoming these challenges requires (1) detailed documentation of phenotypes/genetic diseases and their likely mode of inheritance (and collection of related DNA samples), (2) conducting association studies to identify phenotypes/genetic diseases causing genetic variants (instead of classical linkage analysis, which requires extended pedigrees), and (3) validating likely causative variants by screening a large number of camel samples from different populations. We attempt to address these issues by establishing a systematic way of collecting camel DNA samples, and associated phenotypic information, which we call the "Cdrom Archive." Here, we outline the process of building this archive to introduce it to other camel researchers (as an example). Additionally, we discuss the use of this archive to study the phenotypic traits of Arabian Peninsula camel breeds (the "Mezayen" camels). Using the Cdrom Archive, we report variable phenotypic traits related to the coat (color, length, and texture), ear and tail lengths, along with other morphological measurements.
