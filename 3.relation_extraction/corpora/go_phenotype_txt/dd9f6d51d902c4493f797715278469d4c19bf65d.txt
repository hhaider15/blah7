1|chunk|Viral fulminant hepatitis (FH) is a severe disease with high mortality resulting from excessive inflammation in the infected liver. Clinical interventions have been inefficient due to the lack of knowledge for inflammatory pathogenesis in the virus-infected liver. We show that wildtype mice infected with murine hepatitis virus strain-3 (MHV-3), a model for viral FH, manifest with severe disease and high mortality in association with a significant elevation in IL-1 expression in the serum and liver. Whereas, the viral infection in IL-1 receptor-I deficient (IL-1R1 -/-) or IL-1R antagonist (IL-1Ra) treated mice, show reductions in virus replication, disease progress and mortality. IL-1R1 deficiency appears to debilitate the virusinduced fibrinogen-like protein-2 (FGL2) production in macrophages and CD45 + Gr-1 high neutrophil infiltration in the liver. The quick release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by the infected macrophages suggests a plausible viral initiation of NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Further experiments show that mice deficient of p47 phox , a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase subunit that controls acute ROS production, present with reductions in NLRP3 inflammasome activation and subsequent IL-1 secretion during viral infection, which appears to be responsible for acquiring resilience to viral FH. Moreover, viral infected animals in deficiencies of NLRP3 and Caspase-1, two essential components of the inflammasome complex, also have reduced IL-1 induction along with ameliorated hepatitis. Our results demonstrate that the ROS/NLRP3/IL-1 axis institutes an essential signaling pathway, which is over activated and directly causes the severe liver disease during viral infection, which sheds light on development of efficient treatments for human viral FH and other severe inflammatory diseases.

2|chunk|The NLRP3 inflammasome and IL-1 play essential roles in mediating the primary inflammatory responses against pathogen invasions in the host. Hyperactivation of this signaling pathway can lead to life-threatening diseases under certain circumstances. However, it is not clear if NLRP3 inflammasome activation participates in the pathogenesis of viral fulminant hepatitis (FH), a clinical severe syndrome characterized by acute inflammation in the liver along with massive necrosis of hepatocytes and hepatic encephalopathy during viral infection. Using a mouse viral FH model by infection with murine hepatitis virus strain-3 (MHV-3), we observed a significant macrophage induction and the serum and liver massive accumulation of IL-1. Conversely, interruption of IL-1 signals results in attenuation of the MHV-3-induced hepatitis and mortality. Blocking IL-1 activity reduces the virus-induced expression of fibrinogen-like protein-2 (FGL2) in macrophages, and limits the liver recruitment of CD45 + Gr-1 high neutrophils upon the virus infection. We further show that proIL-1 is bioprocessed by NLRP3 inflammasome. Deletion of the components in the inflammasome complex, including NLRP3 and Caspase-1, leads to reduction in the virus-induced IL-1 production and lessening of disease progression. Further studies show that macrophages in deficiency of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase subunit p47 phox , a protein that controls acute ROS production, prevents NLRP3 inflammasome activation and IL-1 secretion, suggesting that the virus-induced ROS production can directly initiate NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Therefore, p47 phox-/mice exhibited certain degrees of MHV-3 resistance. Taken together, these results demonstrate that ROS/NLRP3/IL-1 is the key pathway signaling exacerbated inflammatory responses that cause viral FH in mice, suggesting that mediation of this signal cascade may benefit on the disease treatment.
