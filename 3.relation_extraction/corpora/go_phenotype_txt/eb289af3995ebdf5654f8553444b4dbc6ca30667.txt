1|chunk|Here we found that RTD-1 was rapidly fungicidal against blastospores of fluconazole/caspofungin resistant C. albicans strains, and was active against established C. albicans biofilms in vitro. In vivo, systemic administration of RTD-1, initiated at the time of infection or 24 h post-infection, promoted long term survival in candidemic mice whether infected with drug-sensitive or MDR strains of C. albicans. RTD-1 induced an early (4 h post treatment) increase in neutrophils in naive and infected mice. In vivo efficacy was associated with fungal clearance, restoration of dysregulated inflammatory cytokines including TNF-, IL-1, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-17, and homeostatic reduction in numbers of circulating neutrophils and monocytes. Because these effects occurred using peptide doses that produced maximal plasma concentrations (Cmax) of less than 1% of RTD-1 levels required for in vitro antifungal activity in 50% mouse serum, while inducing a transient neutrophilia, we suggest that RTD-1 mediates its antifungal effects in vivo by host directed mechanisms rather than direct fungicidal activity. Results of this study suggest that -defensins represent a new class of host-directed compounds for treatment of disseminated candidiasis.

2|chunk|Systemic infection caused by MDR fungi is a growing global health concern. It is estimated that approximately 1.5 million cases of disseminated mycoses occur annually and are associated with high mortality rates 1-3 . Fungal pathogens are a major cause of hospital-acquired infection 4 , particularly among surgical patients and those with indwelling catheters 5 . Increased risk of systemic fungal infection is also associated with biologic therapies for treatment of inflammatory or autoimmune diseases 6,7 .

3|chunk|Among fungal infections, Candida spp. are the most frequent causative organisms worldwide 4,8 . Over 400,000 cases of candidiasis occur annually 9 with increased risk of infection associated with defects in innate immunity, neutropenia, and diabetes 10-12 . The growing incidence of MDR Candida spp. infections has contributed to the increase in mortality rates associated with systemic candidiasis 13-15 . A major risk factor for systemic candidiasis is the presence of biofilms that commonly colonize implanted medical devices such as venous catheters. Biofilms are notoriously resistant to antifungal therapy and are the source of blood borne dissemination [16] [17] [18] [19] .

4|chunk|The failure to develop agents that are selective against eukaryotic pathogens has impeded the clinical introduction of new antifungals 14 . Currently, there are but three classes of antifungal drugs that are relied upon for treatment of invasive fungal infections: polyenes, azoles, and echinocandins 20 . Echinocandins, introduced nearly 20 years ago, are the most recently approved class of antifungals. Limitations associated with use of currently available agents include limited activity spectra 17,21,22 , serious adverse side effects 23,24 , and lack of activity against biofilms 25, 26 . The emergence of MDR fungal pathogens underscores the urgent need for development of new approaches for treatment of fungal infections [27] [28] [29] .

5|chunk|-defensins are macrocyclic peptides containing an 18 amino acid cyclic backbone stabilized by a tri-disulfide core 30 . Numerous naturally occurring -defensin isoforms are expressed in Old World monkeys (OWM) such as macaques, baboons, and vervets 31-34 , but the peptides are absent in New World monkeys, apes and humans 30 . RTD-1, the prototype rhesus macaque -defensin, is effective in preclinical models of polymicrobial and E. coli sepsis 35 , SARS-coronavirus infection 36 , a mouse model of P. aeruginosa induced cystic fibrosis 37 , and endotoxin-induced lung injury 38 . In a recent study we reported that -defensins are potently fungicidal in vitro against MDR C. albicans and non-albicans Candida spp., including the emerging pathogen Candida auris 39 .

6|chunk|In the current study we evaluated the antifungal activities of RTD-1 against planktonic cells and biofilms of drug sensitive and MDR C. albicans strains in vitro, and found the peptide to be fungicidal against both forms of each strain. We then tested RTD-1 for efficacy in a therapeutic mouse model of systemic candidiasis and analyzed the effects of peptide treatment on survival, fungal clearance, and on inflammatory biomarkers in infections mediated by drug-sensitive and MDR isolates of C. albicans.

8|chunk|Statistical analyses. Survival curves were compared using the log rank (Mantel-Cox) test. Blood levels of PMNs and monocytes, and plasma levels of cytokines were compared using Mann-Whitney test. One-way ANOVA was used for analysis of variance of fungal burden data, followed by uncorrected Fisher's Least Significant Difference (LSD) test. Significance of survival endpoint was calculation by  2 analysis (Fig. 7 only) . All statistical analyses employed GraphPad Prism 8.12.
