0	40	67 respiratory tract infection	Phenotype	HP_0011947

1|chunk|Background: Human bocavirus (HBoV) is a recently discovered parvovirus associated with mild to severe lower respiratory tract infections in children, the aim of the work was determination of human bocavirus in nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) of infants by qualitative PCR and determination of acute human bocavirus infection by estimation of immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies in serum by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Results: Twenty two (22%) out of the 100 NPA specimens of the patients with respiratory manifestations were positive for HBoV by qualitative PCR, while ELISA revealed positive HBoV IgM antibodies in 18 (18%) patients who were also positive by PCR. Non of the controls were positive by both techniques. The correlation study between ELISA and PCR revealed high significant association, (p < 0.001, X 2 = 36 and agreement = 96%). Also PCR detected 4 (18.1%) NPA samples as HBoV positive cases among the patients that were not identified by ELISA. This could be due to high sensitivity and efficacy of PCR. ELISA being less sensitive than RT-PCR, sensitivity was (81.8% vs 100%), the efficacy was 97.7% in ELISA versus 99.7% for RT-PCR. Conclusion: HBoV infections could be diagnosed in NPA of children by conventional PCR as a rapid and sensitive technique. While ELISA was a reliable serologic analysis for diagnosis of acute HBoV infection by estimation IgM antibodies in serum.
