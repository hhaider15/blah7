1|chunk|Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), which is the causative agent of porcine epidemic diarrhea in China and other countries, is responsible for serious economic losses in the pork industry. Inactivated PEDV vaccine plays a key role in controlling the prevalence of PEDV. However, consistently low viral titers are obtained during the propagation of PEDV in vitro; this represents a challenge to molecular analyses of the virus and vaccine development. In this study, we successfully isolated a PEDV isolate (strain NJ) from clinical samples collected during a recent outbreak of diarrhea in piglets in China, using porcine intestinal epithelial cells (IEC). We found that the isolate was better adapted to growth in IECs than in Vero cells, and the titer of the IEC cultures was 10 4.5 TCID 50 /0.1 mL at passage 45. Mutations in the S protein increased with the viral passage and the mutations tended towards attenuation. Viral challenge showed that the survival of IEC-adapted cultures was higher at the 45th passage than at the 5th passage. The use of IECs to isolate and propagate PEDV provides an effective approach for laboratory-based diagnosis of PEDV, as well as studies of the epidemiological characteristics and molecular biology of this virus.

2|chunk|During this period, the effectiveness of the CV777-based vaccine was questioned as PED outbreaks also occurred in vaccinated herds [12] . PED has since become one of the most significant epidemics affecting pig farming in China [13] . PEDV is an enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus belonging to the genus Alphacoronavirus, family Coronaviridae, and order Nidovirales [14, 15] . The size of its genome is approximately 28 kb, with 5 -and 3 -untranslated regions (UTRs) and seven open reading frames (ORFs) that encode four structural proteins, i.e., spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N), and three nonstructural proteins [10, 16] . The S protein of PEDV is the major enveloped protein of the virion, associated with growth adaptation in vitro and attenuation in vivo [17] . In addition, the S glycoprotein is used to determine the genetic relatedness among PEDV isolates and for developing diagnostic assays and effective vaccines [18] [19] [20] .

3|chunk|The ability to propagate the virus is critical for the diagnosis and molecular analysis of PEDV, particularly the development of inactivated or attenuated vaccine. However, propagation of PEDV in vitro is challenging. Even though PEDV may be isolated from clinical samples, it gradually loses its infectivity during further passages in cell culture [4] . Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the disinfection efficiency in vitro viral isolates using a cell culture system that promotes growth of PEDV. Currently, several PEDV strains, such as CV777, KPEDV-9, and 83P-5, have been successfully propagated in Vero cells using media with added trypsin [21] [22] [23] . In recent years, new variants of PEDV have emerged that are difficult to isolate and propagate in Vero cells with trypsin. Researchers have attempted to use pig bladder and kidney cells to isolate PEDV, with the addition of trypsin to the medium; this is the first report of isolation of PED virus in porcine cell culture [24] . PEDV infects the epithelium of the small intestine, which is a protease-rich environment, and causes atrophy of the villi resulting in diarrhea and dehydration; this indicates that porcine intestinal epithelial cells are the target cells of this virus. In 2014, Wang et al. established a porcine intestinal epithelial cell line (ZYM-SIEC02) by introducing the human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) gene into small intestinal epithelial cells derived from a neonatal, unsuckled piglet [25]. Several studies have used this established porcine intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) line [26,27]; however, the characteristics of PEDV cultured in this cell line have not been reported.

4|chunk|The present study aimed to confirm and identify PEDV in samples collected from piglets with suggestive clinical signs, using the IEC line established by Wang et al. [25] . A PEDV isolate, named PEDV strain NJ, was successfully isolated. Our results show that the PEDV strain NJ is adapted to growth in IECs with media containing trypsin, suggesting a new approach for the propagation of PEDV. Furthermore, the phylogeny and mutations of the S gene during serial passages were analyzed to determine its genetic homology and molecular variability. A virulence experiment for IEC-adapted NJ also confirmed that the virus had a tendency towards attenuation at 45 passages.
