1|chunk|Supplementary Figure 1 Supplementary Figure 1. Representative electron density map and comparison of m336 epitope and DPP4 binding site on MERS-CoV RBD (a) Stereo view of 2F o -F c electron density at the interface of m336 and MERS-CoV RBD contoured at 1.0  level. The MERS-CoV RBD, m336 heavy and light chains are shown with stick representation with C atoms colored orange, light green and light blue, respectively. MERS-CoV RBD residue 535 is labeled for view orientation. (b and c) Sideby-side comparison of m336 epitope and DPP4 binding site on MERS-CoV RBD shown in both cartoon (top) and surface representation (bottom). The epitope of m336 (b) is colored in green and the binding site of DPP4 (c) is colored in purple on MERS-CoV RBD .
