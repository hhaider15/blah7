1|chunk|Background: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is the leading cause of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in Asia and Africa. Existing antivirals cannot cure HBV or eliminate risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. Glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) can inhibit HBV replication, but promote virion secretion and hepatocellular cancer cell invasion. For these reasons, the overall effect of GRP78 on HBV production and whether to utilize the HBV replication-inhibitory effect of GRP78 up-regulation or the hepatocellular cancer cell invasion-inhibitory effect of its down-regulation were further investigated in order to improve the efficacy of current antiviral therapy.

2|chunk|Methods: GRP78 regulations in HepG2.2.15 cells were conducted by transfections of expressing vector and small interfering RNA, respectively. The changes in HBV replication, hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) synthesis and hepatoma cell motility were monitored.

3|chunk|Results: GRP78 overall decreased HBV production due to its HBV replication-inhibitory effect time-dependently overwhelming virion secretion-promoting effect in HepG2.2.15 cells. Unlike the parental cells (HepG2), HepG2.2.15 cells demonstrated decreased expressions of the major genes in the interferon-1-dependent pathway. Moreover, the expressions of these genes were not affected by GRP78 regulations. However, GRP78 was found to inhibit HBeAg secretion and to increase the retro-transportation of capsid assembly-interfering HBeAg precursor from the endoplasmic reticulum into the cytosol where new viral nucleocapsids formed. Furthermore, GRP78 overexpression promoted wound healing process (the motility) of HepG2.2.15 cells. In contrast, GRP78 knockdown enhanced HBV replication and HBeAg secretion, but they were abolished by entecavir and furin inhibitor, respectively.

4|chunk|Conclusions: GRP78 mainly demonstrates anti-HBV effects, reducing HBV production and HBeAg secretion. With due regard to the hepatocellular cancer invasion risk of the overexpression and the rectifiability of the unpleasant effects of the knockdown, GRP78 down-regulation may be more suitable to serve as an additive strategy to cover the hepatocellular cancer prevention shortage of current antiviral therapy in the future.
