1|chunk|The aim of the study is to identify how the wearing of personal protective equipment (PPE) over a longer period of time under different temperature conditions affects physical performance, individual feeling, power of concentration and error ratio. Two different PPE systems are compared while carrying out typical laboratory work in two different temperature conditions. To be able to develop adequate working conditions for future laboratory workers in high security laboratories, it is necessary to identify previously mentioned parameters as well as indicators that duly indicate overload and error ratio. Based on these measurements a maximum reasonable working time under given circumstances shall be established. The study is conducted within the framework of the EU project "European Research Infrastructure on Highly Pathogenic Agents (ERINHA)" where a pan-European solution for the collection of pathogenic samples should be developed.
