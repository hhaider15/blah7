1|chunk|As cell-invading molecular machinery, coronavirus spike proteins pose an evolutionary conundrum due to their high divergence. In this study, we determined the cryo-EM structure of avian infectious bronchitis coronavirus (IBV) spike protein from the -genus. The trimeric IBV spike ectodomain contains three receptor-binding S1 heads and a trimeric membranefusion S2 stalk. While IBV S2 is structurally similar to those from the other genera, IBV S1 possesses structural features that are unique to different other genera, thereby bridging these diverse spikes into an evolutionary spectrum. Specifically, among different genera, the two domains of S1, the N-terminal domain (S1-NTD) and C-terminal domain (S1-CTD), diverge from simpler tertiary structures and quaternary packing to more complex ones, leading to different functions of the spikes in receptor usage and membrane fusion. Based on the above structural and functional comparisons, we propose that the evolutionary spectrum of coronavirus spikes follows the order of -, -, -, and -genus. This study has provided insight into the evolutionary relationships among coronavirus spikes and deepened our understanding of their structural and functional diversity.

2|chunk|Because of their structural and functional diversity, coronavirus spike proteins represent a model system for studying viral evolution. Their evolutionary relationships and history pose major puzzles in virology. A critical missing piece in understanding the evolution of coronavirus spikes is the unavailability of the tertiary structure of -coronavirus spikes.

The funders had no role in study design, data collection to different other genera; hence it brings the spikes from different coronavirus genera into one evolutionary spectrum, with itself sitting in the middle of this spectrum. The order of the evolutionary spectrum is -, -, -, and -genus. Importantly, through comparisons between IBV spike and other coronavirus spikes, this study illustrates how coronavirus spikes have achieved structural and functional diversity through evolution to guide viral entry into host cells.
