1|chunk|In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, 11 out of 42 tRNA species contain 5-methoxycarbonylmethyl-2-thiou ridine (mcm 5 s 2 U), 5-methoxycarbonylmethyluridine (mcm 5 U), 5-carbamoylmethyluridine (ncm 5 U) or 5carbamoylmethyl-2 -O-methyluridine (ncm 5 Um) nucleosides in the anticodon at the wobble position (U 34 ). Earlier we showed that mutants unable to form the side chain at position 5 (ncm 5 or mcm 5 ) or lacking sulphur at position 2 (s 2 ) of U 34 result in pleiotropic phenotypes, which are all suppressed by overexpression of hypomodified tRNAs. This observation suggests that the observed phenotypes are due to inefficient reading of cognate codons or an increased frameshifting. The latter may be caused by a ternary complex (aminoacyl-tRNA*eEF1A*GTP) with a modification deficient tRNA inefficiently being accepted to the ribosomal A-site and thereby allowing an increased peptidyl-tRNA slippage and thus a frameshift error. In this study, we have investigated the role of wobble uridine modifications in reading frame maintenance, using either the Renilla/Firefly luciferase bicistronic reporter system or a modified Ty1 frameshifting site in a HIS4A::lacZ reporter system. We here show that the presence of mcm 5 and s 2 side groups at wobble uridines are important for reading frame maintenance and thus the aforementioned mutant phenotypes might partly be due to frameshift errors.
