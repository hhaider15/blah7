1|chunk|The predictors for fatal adenovirus (AdV) pneumonia among immunocompetent adults are unclear. Laboratory-confirmed, hospitalized AdV pneumonia adults were prospectively enrolled in Beijing Chao-Yang hospital from March to June 2013. Clinical data and serial whole blood and respiratory tract secretions from such patients were collected. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed to quantify the viral load. A total of 14 AdV pneumonia cases were consecutively enrolled, and four of them were fatal. Ten cases were caused by AdV-55, three by AdV-7 and one by AdV-3. There were no differences in age, gender or underlying diseases between the patients in the fatal cases and surviving cases. At admission (on day 5-7 after illness onset), the patients in fatal cases presented higher initial viral loads in respiratory tract secretions (8.578  2.115 vs 6.263  1.225 Log 10 copies/ml, p = 0.023). All patients in fatal cases presented with viremia on day 12-14 (100% vs 66.7%, p = 0.017). A higher initial viral load in the respiratory tract and sustained viremia (more than 2 weeks) may be predictors for fatal clinical outcomes. Fig 4.

On the y-axis, viral load level is presented with log 10 DNA copy numbers per ml of sample, and myocardial enzyme level is expressed as log 2 CK-MB ng/ml and log 2 CTNI ng/ml. CK-MB = Creatine Kinase-MB, CTNI = Cardiac troponin I.
