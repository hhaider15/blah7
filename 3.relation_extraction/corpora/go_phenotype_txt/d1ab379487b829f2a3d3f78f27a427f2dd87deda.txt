1|chunk|Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) is a highly neurovirulent coronavirus that invades the central nervous system (CNS) in piglets. Although important progress has been made toward understanding the biology of PHEV, many aspects of its life cycle remain obscure. Here we dissected the molecular mechanism underlying cellular entry and intracellular trafficking of PHEV in mouse neuroblastoma (Neuro-2a) cells. We first performed a thin-section transmission electron microscopy (TEM) assay to characterize the kinetics of PHEV, and we found that viral entry and transfer occur via membranous coating-mediated endo-and exocytosis. To verify the roles of distinct endocytic pathways, systematic approaches were used, including pharmacological inhibition, RNA interference, confocal microscopy analysis, use of fluorescently labeled virus particles, and overexpression of a dominant negative (DN) mutant. Quantification of infected cells showed that PHEV enters cells by clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) and that low pH, dynamin, cholesterol, and Eps15 are indispensably involved in this process. Intriguingly, PHEV invasion leads to rapid actin rearrangement, suggesting that the intactness and dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton are positively correlated with viral endocytosis. We next investigated the trafficking of internalized PHEV and found that Rab5-and Rab7-dependent pathways are required for the initiation of a productive infection. Furthermore, a GTPase activation assay suggested that endogenous Rab5 is activated by PHEV and is crucial for viral progression. Our findings demonstrate that PHEV hijacks the CME and endosomal system of the host to enter and traffic within neural cells, providing new insights into PHEV pathogenesis and guidance for antiviral drug design. IMPORTANCE Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV), a nonsegmented, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA coronavirus, invades the central nervous system (CNS) and causes neurological dysfunction. Neural cells are its targets for viral progression. However, the detailed mechanism underlying PHEV entry and trafficking remains unknown. PHEV is the etiological agent of porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis, which is an acute and highly contagious disease that causes numerous deaths in suckling piglets and enormous economic losses in China. Understanding the viral entry pathway will not only advance our knowledge of PHEV infection and pathogenesis but also open new approaches to the development of novel therapeutic strategies. Therefore, we employed systematic approaches to dissect the internalization and intracellular trafficking mechanism of PHEV in Neuro-2a cells. This is the first report to describe the process of PHEV entry into He W. 2017.

(B) A PHEV internalization assay was carried out with cells pretreated with CPZ at the indicated concentrations. Following internalization, surface-bound viruses were removed and detected by qRT-PCR. The internalization of VSV via CME was used as a control. (C) PHEV RNA replication was inhibited by pretreatment of the cells with CPZ for 1 h, and relative hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) gene expression was assessed using qRT-PCR. (D) PHEV protein synthesis was suppressed by pretreatment with CPZ. Cell lysates were collected, and the expression level of the major viral S protein was measured by Western blotting. (E) PHEV particles colocalized with clathrin. Neuro-2a cells were transfected with DsRed-clathrin prior to incubation with PHEV. The enlarged box indicates PHEV particles (green) that were swallowed into the vesicle structure, which bears clathrin (red) on the outer surface; colocalized signals were widely observed using confocal microscopy. (F) Neuro-2a cells were transfected with an siRNA directed against CHC or a control mock siRNA (siCtrl). Inhibition of PHEV internalization and replication was assessed by qRT-PCR to quantify relative gene expression (top) or by immunoblotting to analyze viral protein synthesis (bottom). The RNAi efficiency against CHC was also examined using an anti-CHC primary antibody. (G) The PHEV load and CHC expression in Neuro-2a cells against a background of CHC depletion were calculated at 24 hpi by confocal microscopy. The relative fluorescence intensities of PHEV and CHC staining are presented in the histogram on the right. Bars, 10 m. **, P  0.01.
