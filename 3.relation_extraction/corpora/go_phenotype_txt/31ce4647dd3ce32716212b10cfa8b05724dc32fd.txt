1|chunk|Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a highly contagious coronavirus that causes severe diarrhea and death, particularly in neonatal piglets. The nucleocapsid protein (N protein) of PEDV presents strong immunogenicity and contributes to the cross-reactivity between PEDV and TGEV. However, the characterization of epitopes on the PEDV N protein remains largely unknown. Here, two monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific to the N protein of a PEDV strain, FJzz1/2011, were generated and screened against a partially overlapping library of 24 GST-fusion N protein-truncated constructs. We confirmed that residues 18-133 (designated NEP-D4) and residues 252-262 (designated NEP-D6) were the epitopes targeted by MAbs PN-D4 and PN-D6, respectively. Sequence analysis revealed that these two epitopes were highly conserved among PEDV strains but were significantly different from other members of the Coronavirinae subfamily. Western blot analysis showed that they could be specifically recognized by PEDV antisera but could not be recognized by TGEV hyperimmune antisera. Indirect immunofluorescence (IFA) assays confirmed no cross-reaction between these two MAbs and TGEV. In addition, the freeze-thaw cycle and protease treatment results indicated that NEP-D4 was intrinsically disordered. All these results suggest that these two novel epitopes and their cognate MAbs could serve as the basis for the development of precise diagnostic assays for PEDV.

2|chunk|Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a member of the genus Alphacoronavirus, which belongs to the family Coronaviridae in the order Nidovirales. The genome of this single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus encodes, from 5 to 3 , the replicase polyproteins pp1a and pp1b, spike (S) protein, ORF3 accessory protein, envelope (E) protein, membrane (M) protein and nucleocapsid (N) protein 1-3 . The typical clinical signs of PEDV infection include watery diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration. Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) was first reported in England in 1971 and then in many other European and Asian countries in the following 30 years. With the advent of live attenuated vaccines, acute outbreaks became rare in both Europe and Asia during 2000-2006 4-8 . Since 2007, however, PEDV has re-emerged and spread across the globe, reaching Asia (Thailand, Vietnam, Japan, and China), Europe (Germany, Spain, Belgium, France, and Portugal), North America (US, Mexico, and Canada), and Australia. These outbreaks were characterized by high morbidity (80-100%) and mortality (50-90%) among suckling piglets 9-23 , causing substantial financial losses to the domestic swine industry. The severity of these epidemics emphasizes the importance of establishing effective disease control and prevention systems worldwide 24 , which will largely depend on well-validated diagnostics tests and vaccinations for PEDV.

3|chunk|The coronavirus N protein binds viral RNA and is involved in several of the biological activities of the virus 25,26 . Previous studies have shown that PEDV N protein is responsible for viral nucleolar localization, host cycle ER stress, S-phase prolongation, up-regulation of interleukin-8 expression and inhibition of interferon- production 27-29 . In addition, PEDV N protein is highly conserved. Large amounts of PEDV N protein can be detected in virus-infected cells, and abundant antibodies against N protein could be induced at the early stage of PEDV infection 30, 31 . Such features of the N protein make it an ideal target antigen for PEDV diagnosis 32 , emphasizing the importance of characterizing the epitopes of PEDV N protein and their related MAbs. Previous research on this issue has been scarce. To our knowledge, only one MAb specific to PEDV N protein has been reported so far, with little information regarding its corresponding epitope and whether it could cross-react with TGEV N protein 33 . More detailed research aimed at characterizing PEDV N protein epitopes is urgently needed.

4|chunk|Acute diarrhea caused by PEDV is clinically difficult to distinguish from disease caused by transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). Therefore, PEDV infection cannot be diagnosed on the basis of clinical findings alone, and laboratory tests are necessary for an etiological diagnosis 34 . Presently, the most commonly used diagnostic methods are reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and real-time PCR, both of which have a high efficiency and reliability in detecting viral genetic materials in fecal and intestinal samples. In addition, immunofluorescence assays (IFAs), electron microscopy (EM), immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), immunochromatography assays and fluorescent microsphere immunoassays (FMIAs) have been widely used to diagnose PEDV infection [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] . Among these methods, ELISA has the greatest potential for clinical diagnosis on a large scale and the greatest significance for the effective detection and control of PEDV, especially in developing countries, where few pig farms are equipped with qualified laboratories for complicated molecular diagnoses. However, the previously established method of indirect ELISA used either the viral proteins extracted from PEDV-infected Vero cells or recombinant N protein generated in Escherichia coli as coating antigens; in some documented DAS-ELISA methods, the specificity of the capture and detection antibodies was unclear 40, 41, 46 . Furthermore, in a recent study, researchers observed the cross-reactivity between PEDV and pig TGEV antisera. They also inferred that one or more epitopes on the N protein could be the contributing factors 47 . These findings called into question the accuracy of current ELISA methods. To establish more reliable serodiagnostic methods for PEDV, it is important to generate MAbs that bind only to PEDV N protein and to map which of their corresponding epitopes that can be recognized by PEDV pig antisera alone.

5|chunk|Most proteins carry out biological functions based on their unique and stable three-dimensional structures. However, studies in recent decades have reported an increasing number of proteins that are fully (intrinsically disordered proteins, IDPs) or partially (intrinsically disordered regions, IDRs) unfolded or disordered under normal physiological conditions yet remain active and functional [48] [49] [50] [51] . Moreover, the essential roles of IDPs/IDRs in the protein interaction network, including cell signaling, transcription, translation, and the cell cycle, have been confirmed 50,52-54 . In particular, disorder abundance can be predicted and observed in viral proteins 55,56 . The unstable structures of IDPs/IDRs make it difficult for the immune system to recognize the viral epitopes, eliciting a poor immune response from the host. Partially or wholly unfolded viral proteins can also quickly adapt to and survive in the host environment due to the very high mutation rates of viral genomes 57,58 . Moreover, IDPs, as important components of antigens, are abundant in several pathogenic organisms 59,60 . Disordered epitopes are distinct and specific, and they efficiently interact with their cognate antibodies 60,61 . Studies have demonstrated that the molecular mechanism by which IDPs function is closely associated with the transition from the disordered to the folded state upon binding with their partners, which could be proteins, DNA, RNA or membranes 51,62,63 . However, a similar phenomenon in terms of the recognition of disordered epitopes by antibodies has not yet been reported. Studies on SARS have demonstrated that IDRs comprise the flexible linker between the N-terminal domain (NTD) and C-terminal domain (CTD) in N protein and have RNA-binding abilities 64 . However, little attention has been paid to characterizing other intrinsically disordered epitopes of Coronaviruses.

6|chunk|To better understand the characterization of epitopes on PEDV N protein, in this study, two MAbs against N protein (PN-D4 and PN-D6) were generated, and their corresponding epitopes (NEP-D4 and NEP-D6) were identified and characterized. Further analysis based on sequence alignment, IFA and Western blotting showed the conservation, specificity and immunogenicity of NEP-D4 and NEP-D6. We also demonstrated that both NEP-D4 and NEP-D6 failed to result in cross-reactivity between PEDV and TGEV. Thus, these two MAbs (PN-D4 and PN-D6) and their corresponding epitopes (NEP-D4 and NEP-D6) could be theoretically applied to clinically accessible diagnostic assays for PEDV. In addition, GeneSilico metadisorder and Phyre2 3D structure prediction, freeze-thaw cycle analysis, and treatment with trypsin and DTT all indicated that NEP-D4 is probably an intrinsically disordered protein. Based on these findings, we speculated that the folding following the binding effect might be the factor behind the recognition of NEP-D4 by PN-D4. This finding has not been previously reported but might warrant further investigation aimed at better understanding the mechanism by which a disordered epitope combines with its cognate antibody.

8|chunk|To generate MAbs specific to the PEDV N protein, we immunized BALB/c mice with the purified PEDV strain FJzz1/2011. We acquired hybridoma cells by fusing SP20 cells and the spleen cells from immunized mice. Next, the hybridoma cell lines that survived culture in HAT and HT media were screened by IFA against the PEDV strain FJzz1/2011. We obtained six positive clones (F21-F3, F31-F3, F31-D4, F31-G4, F31-D6 and F42-G4) that were specific to PEDV (Fig. 1a) . We then examined which MAbs could detect the GST-tagged recombinant N protein using indirect ELISA. F31-D4 and F31-D6 exhibited a positive color, whereas F21-F3, F31-F3, F31-G4 and F42-G4 were negative (Fig. 1b) . We designated the MAbs secreted by hybridomas F31-D4 and F31-D6 as PN-D4 and PN-D6, respectively. The results suggested that MAbs PN-D4 and PN-D6 are specific to PEDV N protein. OH851 USA
