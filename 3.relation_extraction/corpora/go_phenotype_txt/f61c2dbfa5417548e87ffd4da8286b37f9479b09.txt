0	67	75 severity	Phenotype	HP_0012824

1|chunk|The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the therapeutic and safety performance of an intramuscular treatment protocol of multidose of allogeneic adipose stem cells (ASCs) isolated, characterized, and expanded ex vivo from a healthy canine donor.

2|chunk|Twelve dogs diagnosed with canine atopic dermatitis (CAD) were intramuscularly treated with 0.510 6 of cryopreserved ASCs from a healthy immunized young canine Ehrlichia canis free donor weekly for 6 weeks. Treatment efficacy was evaluated by the pruritus index and the CAD Lesion Index (CADLI) test. Safety and adverse effects were determined by injection site reaction, weight, blood chemistry, liver function, and whole blood count.

3|chunk|Results: Canine ASCs obtained from a donor met the minimum qualities required for this type of cells and showed viability of 90% after thawing. The efficacy of the CADLI score and the pruritus index in 12 dogs with atopic dermatitis was statistically significant efficacy. No adverse reactions were observed at the intramuscular application site, or in relation to animal weight, blood cell populations, or liver and renal function.

4|chunk|These results suggest that intramuscular administration of cryopreserved ASCs to dogs with atopic dermatitis is a promising cellular therapeutic product for the relief of the symptoms of this disease; however, the duration of the effects obtained with this dose and with other doses should be evaluated, as well as possible immune reactions. As far as we know, this is the first report of the use of multiple intramuscular doses cryopreserved ASCs to treat atopic dermatitis.
