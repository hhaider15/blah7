1|chunk|We computed the following metrics to characterize the connectedness of each citation network: "hub scores" and "authority scores" based on the methods of Kleinberg (1999) ; the maximum number of incoming and outgoing citations for a single source; the fraction of all sources with at least one incoming and outgoing citation; and the percentage of original sources that had at least one incoming citation. Hub and authority scores are values between 0 and 1, computed so that the vector norm of each set of scores is equal to 1. A high hub score value for a particular source indicates that the given paper provides links to many strong authorities on the topic. A high authority score for a particular source indicates that the given paper is cited by many other sources.
