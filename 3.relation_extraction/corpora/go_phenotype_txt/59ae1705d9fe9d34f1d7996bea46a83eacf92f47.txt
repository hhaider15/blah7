1|chunk|A novel Schiff base, ethyl 4-[(E)-(2-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl)methyleneamino]benzoate (HL), was prepared and structurally characterized on the basis of elemental analyses, 1 H NMR, 13 C NMR, UV-Vis and IR spectral data. Six new copper(II) complexes, [Cu(L)(NO3)(H2O)2] (1), [Cu(L)2] (2), [Cu(L)(OAc)] (3), [Cu2 (L)2Cl2(H2O)4] (4), [Cu(L)(ClO4)(H2O)] (5) and [Cu2(L2S)(ClO4)(H2O)]ClO4H2O (6) have been synthesized. The characterization of the newly formed compounds was done by IR, UV-Vis, EPR, FAB mass spectroscopy, elemental and thermal analysis, magnetic OPEN ACCESS Molecules 2015, 20 5772 susceptibility measurements and molar electric conductivity. The crystal structures of Schiff base and the complex [Cu2(L2S)(ClO4)(H2O)]ClO4H2O (6) have been determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction studies. Both copper atoms display a distorted octahedral coordination type [O4NS]. This coordination is ensured by three phenol oxygen, two of which being related to the -oxo-bridge, the nitrogen atoms of the azomethine group and the sulfur atoms that come from the polydentate ligand. The in vitro antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Salmonella enteritidis, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Enterococcus and Candida albicans strains was studied and compared with that of free ligand. The complexes 1, 2, 5 showed a better antimicrobial activity than the Schiff base against the tested microorganisms.
