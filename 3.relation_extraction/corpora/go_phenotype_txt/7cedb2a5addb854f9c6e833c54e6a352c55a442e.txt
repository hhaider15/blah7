1|chunk|We report an outbreak of canine distemper virus (CDV) infection among endangered giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca). Five of six CDV infected giant pandas died. The surviving giant panda was previously vaccinated against CDV. Genomic sequencing of CDV isolated from one of the infected pandas (giant panda/SX/2014) suggests it belongs to the Asia-1 cluster. The hemagglutinin protein of the isolated virus and virus sequenced from lung samples originating from deceased giant pandas all possessed the substitutions V26M, T213A, K281R, S300N, P340Q, and Y549H. The presence of the Y549H substitution is notable as it is found at the signaling lymphocytic activation molecule (SLAM) receptor-binding site and has been implicated in the emergence of highly pathogenic CDV and host switching. These findings demonstrate that giant pandas are susceptible to CDV and suggest that surveillance and vaccination among all captive giant pandas are warranted to support conservation efforts for this endangered species.

2|chunk|The giant panda is native to China and categorized as endangered (criteria C2a(i)) on the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List of Threatened Species. The State Forestry Administration of China reported in the fourth national panda survey that there are 1,864 wild pandas in China, representing a 16.8% increase over the last decade 1 . The current global population of captive giant pandas is 394, and has been gradually approaching the population development goal of 500 2 . Restricted or degraded habitat poses a significant threat to wild panda populations, and wild panda habitat and protected areas have significantly expanded to include a total of 5.94 million hectares 1 . Changes in the population or habitat of giant pandas may place animals at increased risk of infectious disease and hinder conservation efforts.

3|chunk|Canine distemper virus (CDV) has been reported to cause morbidity and mortality in giant pandas. In 1997, three giant pandas at the Chongqing Zoo were infected with CDV, as confirmed by recovery and sequencing of the CDV hemagglutinin (H) gene from affected pandas without an effort to recover CDV isolates or characterize other viral genes 3 . Additionally, serological data from the Wolong Research Center showed that four of sixty-seven unvaccinated giant pandas had detectable CDV antibody titers 4 . These reports indicate that CDV can infect giant pandas, though it has been nearly 20 years since the last clinical cases were reported.

4|chunk|CDV is an enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus of the Morbillivirus genus and family Paramyxoviridae. The most common mode of CDV transmission is through aerosolization of respiratory exudate and other body excretions containing virus. CDV infections have been observed in the order Carnivora (e.g., Canidae, Felidae, Mustelidae, Ursidae, and Procyonidae families), as well as in nonhuman primates 5-7 . The recognized host range of CDV has expanded in recent years 8 . Several fatal outbreaks of CDV have been reported in captive wild populations, including lions (Panthera leo), tigers (Panthera tigris), leopards (Panthera pardus) 9 , African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus) 10 , as well as in free-ranging, wild populations of endangered species such as African wild dogs 11 , Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus) 12 and wild Amur Tigers (Panthera tigris altaica) 13 . Outbreaks in cynomolgus monkeys (Macacca fascicularis) and rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) have been also reported 14,15 . Here, we report
