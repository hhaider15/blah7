1|chunk|Since its emergence in 2012, 2,260 cases and 803 deaths due to Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have been reported to the World Health Organization. Most cases were due to transmission in healthcare settings, sometimes causing large outbreaks. We analyzed epidemiologic and clinical data of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases from eleven healthcare-associated outbreaks in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the Republic of Korea between 2015-2017. We quantified key epidemiological differences between outbreaks. Twenty-five percent (n = 105/422) of MERS cases who acquired infection in a hospital setting were healthcare personnel. In multivariate analyses, age 65 (OR 4.8, 95%CI: 2.6-8.7) and the presence of underlying comorbidities (OR: 2.7, 95% CI: 1.3-5.7) were associated with increased mortality whereas working as healthcare personnel was protective (OR 0.07, 95% CI: 0.01-0.34). At the start of these outbreaks, the reproduction number ranged from 1.0 to 5.7; it dropped below 1 within 2 to 6 weeks. This study provides a comprehensive characterization of MERS HCA-outbreaks. Our results highlight heterogeneities in the epidemiological profile of healthcareassociated outbreaks. The limitations of our study stress the urgent need for standardized data collection for high-threat respiratory pathogens, such as MERS-CoV.

2|chunk|Since its emergence in 2012, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has caused recurrent spillovers from dromedary camel populations into the human population 1-3 . As of 1 October 2018, a total of 2260 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection from 27 different countries, including 803 deaths, have been reported to the World Health Organization (WHO), with a large majority of them concentrated in the Arabian peninsula 4 . Although human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV has so far been self-limiting 5-7 , substantial human-to-human transmission has been observed in healthcare settings [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] , reaching up to approximately 550 cases in six weeks in Jeddah and Riyadh in the spring 2014 20-22 (Fig. 1A) .
