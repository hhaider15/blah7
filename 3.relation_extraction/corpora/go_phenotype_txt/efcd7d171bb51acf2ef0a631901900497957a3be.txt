1|chunk|Aim: This study has been conducted for the purpose of determining serum hepcidin, total antioxidant status (TAS), total oxidant status (TOS), and Fe levels in calves with suspected neonatal septicemia before and after treatment and the clinical significance of hepcidin in calves with suspected neonatal septicemia.

2|chunk|The study material consisted of 15 calves of different ages and sexes brought to the Training, Research and Application Center at the Kafkas University Faculty of Veterinary Medicine with suspected neonatal septicemia. 8.5 mL of blood was drawn from the jugular vein of each animal into coagulant tubes before and after treatment for one-off biochemical analyses and centrifuged. After this, the serum was separated. Hepcidin, TAS, TOS, and Fe levels in the serum were measured. Results: While pre-treatment hepcidin levels were 58.423.46 ng/mL, post-treatment levels were 46.872.98 ng/mL (p<0.05). Pre-treatment Fe levels were 60.137.27 g/dl, while post-treatment levels were 83.18.09 g/dl (p<0.05). The changes in the TAS and TOS levels were also found to be statistically significant. Conclusion: In light of the fact that hepcidin plays a role function in the regulation of Fe as well as the fact that Fe is a significant nutritional source for many microorganisms, it was concluded that hepcidin may play a significant role in nutritional immunity and the pathogenesis of diseases.
