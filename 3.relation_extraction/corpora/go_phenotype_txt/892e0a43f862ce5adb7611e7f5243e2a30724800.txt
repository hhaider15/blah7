Individuals carrying rhinovirus and H. influenzae-S. pneumoniae together were respectively twice and five times more likely to have respiratory symptoms. Individual with H. influenzae-K. pneumoniae carriage were twice (p = 0.04) as likely to develop a cough. The use of disposable handkerchiefs was associated with a decrease in the acquisition of S. aureus (aRR = 0.75, 95%CI [0.57-0.97]). Results could be used to identify pilgrims at increased risk of RTIs and acquisition of respiratory pathogens. Results also confirm the effectiveness of influenza and IPD vaccinations in reducing ILI symptoms and acquisition of S. pneumoniae carriage respectively.

3|chunk|The Hajj is one of the largest annual religious mass gatherings in the world. Each year, Saudi Arabia attracts over 2 million pilgrims from over 180 countries, including about 2,000 from Marseille, France 1 . The Hajj presents major challenges in public health and infection control as the crowding conditions favor the acquisition, dissemination and transmission of pathogenic microorganisms 2 . Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are particularly frequent during the pilgrimage and are responsible for most causes of hospitalization, with community-acquired pneumonia being a major cause of serious illness among pilgrims 3 . Many studies have been conducted among Hajj pilgrims over the last decade, demonstrating the high prevalence of respiratory symptoms and the frequent acquisition of respiratory pathogens 3-7 . The viruses most commonly acquired after the Hajj are human rhinovirus (HRV), human coronaviruses (HCoV) and influenza A virus (IAV). The most frequently acquired respiratory bacteria are Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae), Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Haemophilus influenzae (H. influenzae) 3 . However, the etiology of RTIs at the Hajj is likely multifactorial and complex. The potential effects of vaccination against influenza and pneumococcus 8,9 , of non-pharmaceutical preventive measures including face-mask use and hand hygiene practice 10-12 have been investigated, mostly based on clinical criteria, but results of studies are contradictory.

4|chunk|So far, to our knowledge, risk factors for pathogen acquisition during the Hajj are not clearly identified. Relationship between respiratory symptoms and carriage of respiratory pathogens at the Hajj also remain poorly understood making it difficult distinguishing between infection and colonization. We conducted this www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ study to identify risk factors for respiratory symptoms and respiratory pathogens carriage at the Hajj, including socio-demographics, vaccination against influenza and invasive pneumococcal diseases (IPD) and adherence to non-pharmaceutical preventive measures using data collected from 2014 to 2017. We also evaluated the relationship between pathogen carriage, including multiple carriage and respiratory symptoms.

5|chunk|Characteristics of study participants. The study enrolled 485 pilgrims, 96.5% of whom filled both the pre-and post-travel questionnaires. The study population had a median age of 61.5 years (interquartile = (52 -68 years), min = 21, max = 96 years) and a male:female ratio of 1:1.3 (Table 1 ). The majority (88.4%) of the pilgrims were from North Africa. 66.3% had an indication for vaccination against IPD according to the French recommendation at the time of inclusion 13-20 . Diabetes (28.6%) and hypertension (29.5%) were the most common comorbidities (Table 1) .

6|chunk|With regard to preventive measures, 96 (20.2%) pilgrims reported having been vaccinated against pneumococcal (PCV-13) in the last 5 years, representing 30.5% of pilgrims with an indication for IPD. 26.7% (127/466) were vaccinated against influenza before their travel or in the past year. Two hundred sixty-one (56.0%) pilgrims reported using face masks during the Hajj. Also, 42.1% (196/466), 50.4% (235/466) and 73.6% (343/466) pilgrims declared washing their hands during the Hajj more often than usual, using hand gel, and using disposable handkerchiefs during their stay in Saudi Arabia, respectively.

7|chunk|Clinical features. Figure 1 shows the prevalence of respiratory symptoms among pilgrims during the Hajj.

8|chunk|More than 80% of the pilgrims presented at least one respiratory symptoms, cough, sore throat and rhinitis being the most frequent. Influenza-like illness (ILI) was present in 16.9% of pilgrims. None suffered from pneumonia or other IPD, and only one was hospitalized during the 2017 Hajj season. Time between arrival in Saudi Arabia and onset of symptoms was 9.5  4.8 days (min = 0, max = 22 days).
