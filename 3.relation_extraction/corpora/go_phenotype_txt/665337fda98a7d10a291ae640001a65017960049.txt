1|chunk|Size-controlled gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were synthesised with solutions of three types of Polish honeys (lime, multiflower, honeydew) and used in microwave-induced hyperthermia cancer treatment. Optical and structural properties of nanostructures were optimized in reference to measurements made by using UV/Vis absorption spectrophotometry (UV/Vis), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) supported by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and attenuated total reflectance Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy (ATR FT-IR). In addition, concentrations of reducing sugars and polyphenols of honeys applied were determined to reveal the role of these chemical compounds in green synthesis of AuNPs. It was found that the smallest AuNPs (20.6  23.3 nm) were produced using a 20% (w/v) multiflower aqueous honey solution and 25 mgL 1 of Au(III) ions. These AuNPs were then employed in microwave-induced hyperthermia in a system simulating metastatic tissues. This research illustrated that AuNPs, as produced with the aid of a multiflower honey solution, could be suitably used for microwave-induced heating of cancer. A fluid containing resultant Au nanostructures, as compared to water, revealed facilitated heating and the ability to maintain a temperature of 45  C required for hyperthermia treatment.

2|chunk|. Since hyperthermia-based medical procedures rely on the susceptibility of metastatic tissues to be destroyed at elevated temperatures (41-47  C) [22] , the increase in the thermal response of the area surrounding a tumour may lead to more effective treatment. In microwave-induced hyperthermia procedures, this is achieved by applying nanofluids (NFs) that usually contain metallic nanostructures with ability to be electromagnetically excited. The most common NFs are Fe 3 O 4 -based and are effective in the hyperthermia treatment of bone metastases [16] . AuNPs are usually applied in sophisticated procedures of photo-induced hyperthermia due to the plasmonic effect that they cause [13] . However, based on our previous studies [23, 24] , AuNPs and PtNPs have the extraordinary ability to transfer and accumulate heat, even at ultra-trace concentrations. Therefore, it can be hypothesized that the application of functionalized AuNPs in microwave-induced hyperthermia treatment of cancer may also be very effective.

3|chunk|The wide-range of biomedical applications of AuNPs are related not only to their optical and structural properties, but could also be influenced by toxicity and the chemical composition of reducing and capping agents involved in their synthesis. Although many methods were described for the production of AuNPs, green methods are a promising alternative to well-known chemical methods [25] . In green synthesis, naturally occurring substances are used as reducing and stabilizing agents during AuNPs production instead of strong, and usually toxic, chemicals. For that reason, synthesized AuNPs are biogenic and biocompatible [26] [27] [28] . There are a variety of natural products reported to be suitable for green synthesis of AuNPs. Accordingly, aqueous leaf extracts prepared from Mentha piperita [28], Melissa officinalis [28], Salvia officinalis [28], Terminalia catappa [29], Rosa rugosa [30], Hibiscus rosa sinensis [31], Cinnamomum camphora [32], Eucalyptus globulus [33], Rosmarinus officinalis [33], Ziziphus zizyphus [34], and Plumbago zeylanica [35], aqueous extracts originated from blackberries, blueberries, and pomegranates [36], in addition to essential oils collected from Eucalyptus globulus [33], Rosmarinus officinalis [33], Anacardium occidentale [37], Curcuma pseudomontana [38], and some food products, including Punica granatum juices [39], coffee Arabica infusions [40], and cacao powder beverages [41] were involved in the production of AuNPs. To the best of our knowledge, only a few research groups have attempted to produce honey-based NFs containing Au nanostructures [42] [43] [44] .

4|chunk|Honey is obtained by several from about 20,000 species of bees from nectar, pollen, and honeydew [45] . A large variety of plant species from which bees might collect nectar, pollen, or honeydew, as well as apiary location, and environmental conditions means that several types of honeys can be distinguished [46] . Among them, the most popular are flower, e.g., multi-flower, rapeseed, buckwheat, lime, or heather, and honeydew honeys made from coniferous, leaf, and fir honeydew [47] . The botanical provenience of the nectar, pollen, and honeydew, as well as environmental pollution, influence the chemical composition of honey [48] , which can contain more than 400 different compounds [48] . In addition to water, which content in honey is less than 20% (w/v) [45] , there are many others substances, namely sugars (e.g.
