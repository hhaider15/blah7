1|chunk|The purpose of this study is to evaluate in vitro gene delivery mediated by asialofetuin-appended cationic liposomes (AFliposomes) associating cyclodextrins (CyD/AF-liposomes) as a hepatocyte-selective nonviral vector. Of various CyDs, AFliposomes associated with plasmid DNA (pDNA) and -cyclodextrin (-CyD) (pDNA/-CyD/AF-liposomes) showed the highest gene transfer activity in HepG2 cells without any significant cytotoxicity. In addition, -CyD enhanced the encapsulation ratio of pDNA with AF-liposomes, and also increased gene transfer activity as the entrapment ratio of pDNA into AF-liposomes was increased. -CyD stabilized the liposomal membrane of AF-liposomes and inhibited the release of calcein from AF-liposomes. The stabilizing effect of -CyD may be, at least in part, involved in the enhancing gene transfer activity of pDNA/-CyD/AF-liposomes. Therefore, these results suggest the potential use of -CyD for an enhancer of transfection efficiency of AF-liposomes.
