1|chunk|An early and yet indispensable step in the alphaherpesvirus infection is the engagement of host receptors by the viral envelope glycoprotein D (gD). Of the thus-far identified gD receptors, nectin-1 is likely the most effective in terms of its wide usage by multiple alphaherpesviruses for cell entry. The molecular basis of nectin-1 recognition by the gD protein is therefore an interesting scientific question in the alphaherpesvirus field. Previous studies focused on the herpes simplex virus (HSV) of the Simplexvirus genus, for which both the free gD structure and the gD/nectin-1 complex structure were reported at high resolutions. The structural and functional features of other alphaherpesviral gDs, however, remain poorly characterized. In the current study, we systematically studied the characteristics of nectin-1 binding by the gD of a Varicellovirus genus member, the pseudorabies virus (PRV). We first showed that PRV infects host cells via both human and swine nectin-1, and that its gD exhibits similar binding affinities for nectin-1 of the two species. Furthermore, we demonstrated that removal of the PRV gD membrane-proximal residues could significantly increase its affinity for the receptor binding. The structures of PRV gD in the free and the nectin-1-bound states were then solved, revealing a similar overall 3D fold as well as a homologous nectin-1 binding mode to its HSV counterpart. However, several unique features were observed at the binding interface of PRV gD, enabling the viral ligand to utilize different gD residues (from those of HSV) for nectin-1 engagement. These observed binding characteristics were further verified by the mutagenesis study using the key-residue mutants of nectin-1. The structural and functional data obtained in this study, therefore, provide the basis of receptor recognition by PRV gD. PLOS Pathogens | https://doi.

3|chunk|Both herpes simplex virus (HSV) and pseudorabies virus (PRV) recognize nectin-1 as the cellular receptor. They utilize the envelope glycoprotein D (gD) on the virion surface to interact with nectin-1, initiating the virus infection. Although the molecular basis of nectin-1 binding by HSV gD has been successfully elucidated with high resolution structures, the atomic features of PRV gD interacting with the same receptor remains uncharacterized. Here, we show that PRV gD exhibits nano-molar affinities for both human and swine nectin-1, and deletion of the membrane-proximal loop in the gD ectodomain dramatically increases its receptor-binding avidity. We further solved the free and the nectin-1-bound PRV gD structures. The free gD structure reveals a canonical fold of an IgV-like core wrapped by the N-and C-terminal extensions as observed in the HSV homologs. The N-terminus of PRV gD, however, is shorter than that of HSV gDs. The solved complex structure demonstrates that PRV gD exhibits a homologous receptor-binding mode to the HSV counterpart. Nevertheless, several unique features at the PRV gD binding interface suffice the viral ligand to engage nectin-1 with a series of residues differing from the HSV amino acids. These observations not only delineated the molecular basis of PRV engaging nectin-1 but also enriched our knowledge on the receptor-binding mechanism of the Alphaherpesvirinae subfamily.
