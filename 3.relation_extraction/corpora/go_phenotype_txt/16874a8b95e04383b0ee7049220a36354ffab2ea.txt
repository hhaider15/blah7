1|chunk|Background: Heparin and heparin-related sulphated carbohydrates inhibit ligand binding of the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE). Here, we have studied the ability of heparin to inhibit homophilic interactions of RAGE in living cells and studied how heparin related structures interfere with RAGE-ligand interactions. Methods: Homophilic interactions of RAGE were studied with bead aggregation and living cell protein-fragment complementation assays. Ligand binding was analyzed with microwell binding and chromatographic assays. Cell surface advanced glycation end product binding to RAGE was studied using PC3 cell adhesion assay. Results: Homophilic binding of RAGE was mediated by V 1 -and modulated by C 2 -domain in bead aggregation assay. Dimerisation of RAGE on the living cell surface was inhibited by heparin. Sulphated K5 carbohydrate fragments inhibited RAGE binding to amyloid -peptide and HMGB1. The inhibition was dependent on the level of sulfation and the length of the carbohydrate backbone. -D-Glucopyranosiduronic acid (glycyrrhizin) inhibited RAGE binding to advanced glycation end products in PC3 cell adhesion and protein binding assays. Further, glycyrrhizin inhibited HMGB1 and HMGB1 A-box binding to heparin. Conclusions: Our results show that K5 polysaccharides and glycyrrhizin are promising candidates for RAGE targeting drug development.

3|chunk|Homodimerization and oligomerisation of RAGE can be regulated by receptor ligand binding. In solution, heparin enhances dimer formation of soluble RAGE. Cleavage of heparan sulphate chains on the cell surface inhibits RAGE signaling, suggesting that RAGE forms complexes with proteoglycans [2]. In addition, homophilic interactions of RAGE can be regulated by S100 protein and advanced glycation end product bovine serum albumin (AGE-BSA) ligands. Ligand induced receptor dimerisation and oligomerisation is required for strong RAGE signaling [6, 7] .

4|chunk|-D-Glucopyranosiduronic (glycyrrhizin) is a triterpenoid saponin derived from liquorice root. It is a well-tolerated drug in humans and it has well-documented hepatoprotective effects in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B and C infections [8] [9] [10] [11] . Intravenous glycyrrhizin downregulates serum aspartate aminotransferase and alanine transaminase levels and reduces the occurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma. Further, glycyrrhizin has numerous other protective pharmacological functions, like anti-ulcer and anti-allergic effects (reviewed in the literature [12, 13] ). Glycyrrhizin has anti-viral effects in vitro and it dampens inflammatory reactions in various animal models [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . Anti-inflammatory effects of glycyrrhizin are at least partly due to its ability to downregulate proinflammatory cytokine expression and inhibit leukocyte diapedesis. Glycyrrhizin and heparin have D-glucuronic acid units in their structure and they both are potent inhibitors of transendothelial migration of leukocytes [20] . However, in heparin, D-glucuronic acid units are mostly C5-epimerised to L-iduronic acid and are highly sulphated. Glycyrrhizin can be chemically sulphated, which potentiates its anti-viral effects [21, 22] .

5|chunk|Both glycyrrhizin and heparin bind to HMGB1 and inhibit cell adhesion and migration to HMGB1 [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] . HMGB1 mediates cell migration via both RAGE independent and dependent mechanisms [29] . RAGE independent migration of cells can occur via HMGB1-stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1) heterocomplex mediated pathway [28] . SDF-1 signals through C-X-C chemokine type receptor 4 (CXCR4). In addition, SDF-1 binding to heparan sulphate proteoglycan (HSPG) type cell surface receptors is a prerequisite to it promoting activity of tissue emigration of cells [30] . Further, the importance of HMGB1 in cell migration in vivo was shown in the study by Oyama and others, where decreased leukocyte diapedesis occurred in HMGB1 heterozygote mice [31] . It has been unclear whether interactions of HMGB1 with HSPGs, which mediate cell adhesion and migration, can be inhibited by glycyrrhizin.
