1|chunk|Once thought a mere ribosome factory, the nucleolus has been viewed in recent years as an extremely sensitive gauge of diverse cellular stresses. Emerging concepts in nucleolar biology include the nucleolar stress response (NSR), whereby a series of cell insults have a special impact on the nucleolus. These insults include, among others, ultra-violet radiation (UV), nutrient deprivation, hypoxia and thermal stress. While these stresses might influence nucleolar biology directly or indirectly, other perturbances whose origin resides in the nucleolar biology also trigger nucleolar and systemic stress responses. Among the latter, we find mutations in nucleolar and ribosomal proteins, ribosomal RNA (rRNA) processing inhibitors and ribosomal DNA (rDNA) transcription inhibition. The p53 protein also mediates NSR, leading ultimately to cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, senescence or differentiation. Hence, NSR is gaining importance in cancer biology. The nucleolar size and ribosome biogenesis, and how they connect with the Target of Rapamycin (TOR) signalling pathway, are also becoming important in the biology of aging and cancer. Simple model organisms like the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, easy to manipulate genetically, are useful in order to study nucleolar and rDNA structure and their relationship with stress. In this review, we summarize the most important findings related to this topic. 2 of 22 ribosome factory, and only recently the myriad of processes that it is involved in have begun to be unraveled [4] [5] [6] . Furthermore, the nucleolar structure has proven as an excellent maker for cell stress and growth status. Indeed, nutrition status, environmental cues and stress impinge on its size and shape [7, 8] . The nucleolus is also the assembly site and processing for small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs), small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), telomerase and the signal recognition particle (SRP); all of them with physiological implication for the cell that go beyond the nucleolar environment [9] . To get a much deeper knowledge on the nucleolus in different organisms, we refer the readers to previous excellent reviews by [10, 11] . In this review, we will concentrate on the structural changes of the nucleolus (and the rDNA) of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. However, we will briefly describe some aspects of the nucleolar biology of metazoans that are connected to nucleolar biology of this simple yeast. This correlation has boosted S. cerevisiae as an excellent model organism whereby we can better understand how stress influences the nucleolar biology and vice versa. We will mainly focus on how different stresses modify the morphology of the nucleolus. Importantly, we are mostly leaving out of this review the long-term effects that clastogenic and aneugenic stresses can cause on the rDNA structure, which can also have a great and sustained impact on the nucleolar morphology. The connections between these stresses, the rDNA/nucleolus, cancer and aging deserve by itself a deep and updated review in the future. In summary, we have organized this review in the following chapters. First, a brief historical overview on the nucleolus and its usefulness as a marker of cancer and aging, followed by a description of its composition and structure in the budding yeast. Next, we will go over the morphological changes in the nucleolus seen in both a normal unperturbed cell cycle and after stress. We will pay attention to what is known about the underlying mechanisms responsible for nucleolar reorganization and why we now know they intimately connect with aging. Finally, we will briefly review a clear case of a connection between nucleolar stress and control of cell proliferation in tumor cells that might be exploited in antitumoral therapy. Before we proceed into the next section, we introduce some concepts to better understand the processes presented here. According to Roger B. McDonald's Biology of Aging, aging is the random change in the structure and function of molecules, cells, and organisms that is caused by the passage of time and by one's interaction with the environment. Aging increases the probability of death. On the other hand, longevity is defined as the potential maximum age that an individual of a particular species can attain, that is, the evolved length or duration of life for a species; while life span is the length of life of an individual cell, organ or organism [12] . In budding yeast, aging has been traditionally divided into two different concepts. The first concept, replicative aging, stems from early works in the 50s, and is defined as the number of divisions an individual yeast cell undergoes before dying. The second concept, chronological aging, is the length of time a population of yeast cells remains viable in a nondividing state following nutrient deprivation [13, 14] . Both terms are also usually referred as replicative life span and chronological life span based on the assays developed to measure them [15] . On the next section, we will explain very briefly the evidences for the nucleolar size in relation to cancer and aging.

2|chunk|The size and shape of the nucleolus are tightly related to the growth and proliferation status of the eukaryotic cell, and this is known since several decades ago [16, 17] . An increase in size correlates with a high growth and proliferation rate [18] , and this feature has been used by pathologists over decades as a prognostic marker in tumour tissue samples [19] . In fact, for a specific type of cancer, the Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (ccRCC), the nucleolus is used as the main marker to establish the histological grade [20, 21] . Tumour samples with a normal nucleolar number, size and shape correlates with a good prognostic, while an enlarged size and/or irregular shape correlates with a bad prognostic [22] [23] [24] [25]. Ribosome biogenesis is thus becoming an important aspect of cancer biology [26][27][28]. Remarkably, nucleolar size and aging are also correlated; small nucleoli and reduced ribosome biogenesis are hallmarks of longevity, whereas expanded nucleoli, elevated ribosome biogenesis and increased protein synthesis are hallmarks of aging [29].

3|chunk|(e.g., daf-2), Drosophila melanogaster (under dietary restriction, rapamycin treatment or insulin-like mutants), mice (under dietary restriction and IRS1 long-lived mutants) and human muscles biopsies (under modest dietary restriction) showed the small nucleoli phenotype [30]. On the other hand, cells from Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) patients and cells from aged healthy individuals showed the expanded nucleoli phenotype [31]. In yeast, nucleolar structure goes through two different phases during aging as well: first, expansion and, secondary to this, fragmentation [32,33]. The above observations, conserved throughout evolution, could be employed as a predictive cellular marker for aging in both healthy and aged individuals [34,35].
