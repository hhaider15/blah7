1|chunk|The recent outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) in the Americas and its devastating developmental and neurological manifestations has prompted the development of field-based diagnostics that are rapid, reliable, handheld, specific, sensitive, and inexpensive. The gold standard molecular method for lab-based diagnosis of ZIKV, from either patient samples or insect vectors, is reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The method, however, is costly and requires lab-based equipment and expertise, which severely limits its use as a point-of-care (POC) tool in resource-poor settings. Moreover, given the lack of antivirals or approved vaccines for ZIKV infection, a POC diagnostic test is urgently needed for the early detection of new outbreaks and to adequately manage patients. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a compelling alternative to RT-qPCR for ZIKV and other arboviruses. This low-cost molecular system can be freeze-dried for distribution and exhibits high specificity, sensitivity, and efficiency. A growing body of evidence suggests that LAMP assays can provide greater accessibility to much-needed diagnostics for ZIKV infections, especially in developing countries where the ZIKV is now endemic. This review summarizes the different LAMP methods that have been developed for the virus and summarizes their features, advantages, and limitations.

In May 2015, the first case of ZIKV infection was reported in Brazil [13] and the virus rapidly spread throughout the country and much of Latin America, causing the largest recorded epidemic of the virus to date [14] . The Brazilian epidemic raised great international concern because of severe birth defects, including microcephaly, in neonates born to mothers infected by ZIKV during pregnancy [3, 15, 16] .

3|chunk|ZIKV is transmitted mainly through the bite of infected mosquitoes from the genus Aedes, although other vectors may also be involved in the transmission [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . Additionally, other routes of ZIKV transmission have been identified, including blood transfusions, transplacental, perinatal, and sexual intercourse [22] [23] [24] . ZIKV infection usually causes a self-limiting and a mild illness, where the majority of cases are asymptomatic and, when present, symptoms include fever, headache, rash, conjunctivitis, and arthralgia [25] . In regions where there is a circulation of other arboviruses, such as DENV and chikungunya (CHIKV), the clinical diagnosis of ZIKV infection becomes extremely difficult because of common symptoms. Therefore, laboratory-based molecular diagnosis is of fundamental importance to correctly identify the etiologic agent [3, 26] .

4|chunk|Given the lack of approved vaccines and antivirals against ZIKV, a rapid and reliable point-of-care (POC) diagnostic test for detection of ZIKV is urgently required for control and prevention measures and to increase the diagnostic capacity of ZIKV-affected, mainly in low-resource areas [27, 28] . ZIKV infection is diagnosed in the laboratory by nucleic acid amplification tests or serological methods, including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNT), and lateral flow assays (rapid tests) [6, 7, [29] [30] [31] [32] . Currently, RT-qPCR is considered the gold standard method to detect ZIKV from patient and mosquito samples [6, 7, 29] . Although RT-qPCR provides high-quality results, the test requires extensive sample preparation, RNA extraction, expensive equipment, and technical expertise to run and interpret the amplification of the viral RNA. Moreover, available serological methods are prone to produce false-positive results due to cross-reaction with other flaviviruses in circulation, such as DENV, and are therefore of limited value [6, 7, 33] .

5|chunk|Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a powerful alternative POC assay for the virus as it allows rapid, robust, and simple amplification of nucleic acid targets at a single and fixed temperature [34] . The assay has many advantages over RT-qPCR, including rapidity, low cost, high sensitivity, and high specificity. LAMP results can also be easily read with the naked eye through color-based reporters that can be added to the reaction mixture [35] . Importantly, the simple, single-temperature incubation allows LAMP reactions to be performed without expensive equipment, directly in the field [36] . Since the 2015 emergence of the ZIKV in Brazil, many LAMP assays have been developed for diagnosis by research groups across the world [27, [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] . These diagnostic platforms based on LAMP have proven to be specific, sensitive and inexpensive POC tools that can be applied even in resource-limited regions of the world. Here we review the development and application of LAMP methods for the diagnosis of ZIKV and explore the next steps to bring this assay into mainstream use.
