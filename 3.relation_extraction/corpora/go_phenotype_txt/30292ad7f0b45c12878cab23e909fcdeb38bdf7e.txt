1|chunk|Aminopeptidase M (AMP) inhibition is of interest for several diseases, such as highly vascularized cancer types. AMP can be inhibited by linear pentapeptides isolated from Microcystis aeruginosa LTPNA08 (MG7XX). Porcine AMP inhibition-a model for human AMP-activity was spectrophotometrically measured by the formation of p-nitroanilide from L-leucine-p-nitroanilide substrate by AMP. AMP inhibition by MG770 exhibited comparable inhibition levels to amastatin (IC 50 values: 1.20  0.1 M and 0.98  0.1 M, respectively), while MG756 was slightly less potent (with IC 50 values of 3.26  0.5 M). Molecular modelling suggests a potential binding mode, based on the interaction with the Zn 2+ cofactor, where MG770 s extra methyl group contributes to the disturbance of the Zn 2+ cofactor complex and highlights the importance of hydrophobicity for the site.

The first step involves proton abstraction from the water molecule, coordinated with the catalytic Zn 2+ and stabilized Glu350 (not depicted in Figure 1 ), by the Glu384, which then allows the substrate entrance. The carbonyl oxygen of the substrate's peptide bond is activated by zinc and Tyr472, while the alpha-nitrogen is stabilized by the Ala348 main-chain oxygen, in an intermediate state. As a last step, the peptide bond is hydrolyzed, by the catalytic water attack on the carbonyl carbon of the peptide bond, while the Glu384 shuttles a proton from the catalytic water to the leaving nitrogen group (Figure 1) . Such a coordinated mechanism heavily relies in protonation state of individual residues, as shown by the work of Chen et al., 2014, where the porcine AMP loses activity in high pH solutions (likely due to the deprotonation of Tyr472) and in very low pH (due to the protonation of Glu384) [6, 7] .
