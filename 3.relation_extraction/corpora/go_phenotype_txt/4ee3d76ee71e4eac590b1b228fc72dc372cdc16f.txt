1|chunk|Streptococcus agalactiae (Group B Streptococcus, GBS) normally colonizes healthy adults but can cause invasive disease, such as meningitis, in the newborn. To gain access to the central nervous system, GBS must interact with and penetrate brain or meningeal blood vessels; however, the exact mechanisms are still being elucidated. Here, we investigate the contribution of BspC, an antigen I/II family adhesin, to the pathogenesis of GBS meningitis. Disruption of the bspC gene reduced GBS adherence to human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (hCMEC), while heterologous expression of BspC in non-adherent Lactococcus lactis conferred bacterial attachment. In a murine model of hematogenous meningitis, mice infected with bspC mutants exhibited lower mortality as well as decreased brain bacterial counts and inflammatory infiltrate compared to mice infected with WT GBS strains. Further, BspC was both necessary and sufficient to induce neutrophil chemokine expression. We determined that BspC interacts with the host cytoskeleton component vimentin and confirmed this interaction using a bacterial two-hybrid assay, microscale thermophoresis, immunofluorescent staining, and imaging flow cytometry. Vimentin null mice were protected from WT GBS infection and also exhibited less inflammatory cytokine production in brain tissue. These results suggest that BspC and the vimentin interaction is critical for the pathogenesis of GBS meningitis.

2|chunk|Group B Streptococcus (GBS) typically colonizes healthy adults but can cause severe disease in immune-compromised individuals, including newborns. Despite wide-spread intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis given to pregnant women, GBS remains a leading cause of neonatal meningitis. To cause meningitis, GBS must interact with and penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which separates bacteria and immune cells in the blood from the brain. In order to develop targeted therapies to treat GBS meningitis, it is important to understand the mechanisms of BBB crossing. Here, we describe the role of the GBS surface factor, BspC, in promoting meningitis and discover the host ligand for BspC, vimentin, which is an intermediate filament protein that is constitutively expressed by endothelial cells. We determined that BspC interacts with the C-terminal domain of cellsurface vimentin to promote bacterial attachment to brain endothelial cells and that purified BspC protein can induce immune signaling pathways. In a mouse model of hematogenous meningitis, we observed that a GBS mutant lacking BspC was less virulent compared to WT GBS and resulted in less inflammatory disease. We also observed that mice lacking vimentin were protected from GBS infection. These results reveal the importance of the BspC-vimentin interaction in the progression of GBS meningitis disease.

The gene encoding AspA is located within an integrative and conjugative element designated region of difference 2 (RD2), which likely originated in GBS and was acquired by invasive GAS serotypes through horizontal gene transfer (Fig 1A) . It has been proposed that genes carried within RD2 may contribute to pathogenicity of both GAS and GBS in pregnant women and newborns [16, 17] . Supporting this, AspA has been shown to facilitate GAS biofilm formation and virulence in a murine model of GAS respiratory infection [18] . Recently, in silico analysis has revealed four AgI/II gene homologs in GBS, designated Group B Streptococcus surface proteins (BspA-D), that are distributed among GBS of different capsular serotypes and sequence types [15, 19, 20] . Previous work has shown that BspA and BspB, which share 90% sequence identity, are found in GBS strain NEM316. BspA has been demonstrated to be important in biofilm formation as well as adherence to epithelial cells and may play a role in facilitating colonization through its ability to bind to vaginal epithelium as well as interact with the hyphal filaments of Candida albicans [15, 20] , a frequent fungal colonizer of the lower female reproductive tract. Other GBS strains contain the homolog BspC, or in some cases BspD, which is over 99% identical to BspC, with the major difference being that BspD is missing the leader peptide for targeting to the cell surface by the Sec translocation machinery. While most of the variability between Bsp proteins is in the alanine-rich and proline-rich repeats, the V domain shares 96 to 100% identity across all Bsp homologs [15, 20] . To date, there have not been any studies examining the impact of the AgI/II proteins on GBS invasive disease. A previous study by Chuzeville et al. identified 75 GBS genomes which contain an antigen I/II homolog. Of those 75 CDS, only 40 were associated with transcription and translation signals and out of those, 36 were 2952 base pairs in size encoding the full length BspC protein [19] . Therefore, we chose to investigate the importance of the BspC antigen I/II homolog in the pathogenesis of meningitis. Using targeted mutagenesis, we show that BspC promotes adherence of bacteria to human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (hCMEC) and interacts with the host cytoskeleton component, vimentin. Additionally, we found that BspC and vimentin contribute to the development of GBS meningitis in a mouse infection model. Lastly, we observe that BspC stimulates inflammatory signaling from brain endothelial cells in vitro and in vivo and that this immune signaling involves the NF-B pathway.

5|chunk|BspC contains all six domains characteristic of the AgI/II protein family and shares high homology with other streptococcal AgI/II proteins, especially GAS AspA (Fig 1B) . The proposed domain organization of streptococcal AgI/II polypeptides comprises a stalk consisting of the -helical A (alanine-rich repeats) domain and the polyproline II (PPII) helical P domain, separating the V (variable) domain and the C-terminal domain, which contains the LPXTG motif required for cell wall anchorage [14] . While the GBS BspC structure is not known, the structure of several regions of the GBS homolog, BspA, has been solved [15] . We generated a hypothetical model of full length BspC using PyMOL (The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 2.1 Schrdinger, LLC) for the purpose of showing the overall domain structure (Fig 1C) . Structures of individual BspC domains were generated using Phyre2 server [21] . The V-and C-domains were modeled on the V-and C-domains of BspA (PDB entries 5DZ8 and The GBS adhesin BspC interacts with vimentin to promote meningitis PLOS Pathogens | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1007848 June 10, 2019 3 / 30
