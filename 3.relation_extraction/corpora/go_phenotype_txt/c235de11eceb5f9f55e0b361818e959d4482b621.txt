1|chunk|CTV isolate FS2-2 was collected from a citrus grove in Florida in 2004, and was maintained on Madam Vinous sweet orange in an insect-proof greenhouse. The isolate was associated with an unusual stem-pitting symptom in a Hamlin sweet orange tree in the field. Full-length genomic sequences of seven CTV isolates were retrieved from GenBank: T30, a mild isolate from Florida [1]; T36, a decline-inducing isolate from Florida [2]; SY568, a decline and sweet orange stem pitting isolate from California [3]; VT, a decline and seedling yellows isolate from Israel [4]; T385, an essentially symptomless isolate from Spain which is nearly identical to isolate T30 [5];

In addition, full-length sequences were included of CTV isolate T3 (unpublished) from Florida and H33 from Texas (T. E. Mirkov, personal communication) and a partial sequence (13,585 nt) of the CTV T68 isolate from Florida (unpublished).

3|chunk|Complete full-length genomes of CTV from isolate FS2-2 were amplified as four DNA fragments by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), using four sets of primers. Each set consisted of an RT primer and a pair of PCR primers, and were designed using sequences highly conserved in all known CTV genomes. The extreme sequence diversity at the 5' ends of CTV genomes necessitated three separate primers, one each for the T36-, VT-, and
