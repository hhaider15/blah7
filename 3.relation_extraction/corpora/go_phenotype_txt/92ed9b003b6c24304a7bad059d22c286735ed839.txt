1|chunk|DNA microarrays offer the possibility of testing for the presence of thousands of micro-organisms in a single experiment. However, there is a lack of reliable bioinformatics tools for the analysis of such data. We have developed DetectiV, a package for the statistical software R. DetectiV offers powerful yet simple visualization, normalization and significance testing tools. We show that DetectiV performs better than previously published software on a large, publicly available dataset.
