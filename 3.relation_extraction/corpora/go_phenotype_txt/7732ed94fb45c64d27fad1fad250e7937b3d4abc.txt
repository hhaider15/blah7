1|chunk|S1 Text-Details of the parametric dependence of the force of infection on specific humidity

2|chunk|Eq. 11 allows the transmission rate to depend on time using three terms. The first time dependent term, F 1 (t), allows for a dependence of the transmission rate on specific-humidity. In temperate regions specific humidity has a seasonal oscillation with a minimum in the winter and a maximum in the summer. We follow Shaman et al. [1] and relate the local SH, q j (t), to the reproduction number as:
2	377	389 reproduction	Gene_function	GO_0000003
