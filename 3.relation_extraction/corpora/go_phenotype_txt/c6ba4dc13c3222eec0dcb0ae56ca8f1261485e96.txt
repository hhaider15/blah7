1|chunk|Feline calicivirus (FCV) is a major cause of upper respiratory tract disease in cats, with widespread distribution in the feline population. Recently, virulent systemic diseases caused by FCV infection has been associated with mortality rates up to 50%. Currently, there are no direct-acting antivirals approved for the treatment of FCV infection. Here, we tested 15 compounds from different antiviral classes against FCV using in vitro protein and cell culture assays. After the expression of FCV protease-polymerase protein, we established two in vitro assays to assess the inhibitory activity of compounds directly against the FCV protease or polymerase. Using this recombinant enzyme, we identified quercetagetin and PPNDS as inhibitors of FCV polymerase activity (IC 50 values of 2.8 M and 2.7 M, respectively). We also demonstrate the inhibition of FCV protease activity by GC376 (IC 50 of 18 M). Using cell culture assays, PPNDS, quercetagetin and GC376 did not display antivirals effects, however, we identified nitazoxanide and 2 -C-methylcytidine (2CMC) as potent inhibitors of FCV replication, with EC 50 values in the low micromolar range (0.6 M and 2.5 M, respectively). In conclusion, we established two in vitro assays that will accelerate the research for FCV antivirals and can be used for the high-throughput screening of direct-acting antivirals.

2|chunk|The single-stranded, positive-sense FCV RNA genome (~7.7 kb) is VPg linked, polyadenylated, and includes three open reading frames (ORFs) [16] . ORF1 encodes non-structural proteins, including the 3C-like protease and 3D-like polymerase, ORF2 encodes the major capsid protein and ORF3 encodes a minor protein component of the virion [17] . Wei et al. [18] have demonstrated that the active form of the FCV polymerase is the bifunctional protease-polymerase (Pro-Pol) protein. FCV shows a high level of genetic diversity due to the lack of proofreading and the low fidelity of the viral polymerase, and genome recombination between different FCV strains during coinfections [4, 19, 20] . The phylogenetic classification of FCV strains, based on ORF2 nucleotide sequences, have demonstrated the circulation of a single genogroup (GI) around the globe, with the exception of Japan which has additional circulating strains that belong to a second genogroup (GII) [21] [22] [23] .

3|chunk|Live-attenuated and inactivated vaccines against FCV have been available for over 40 years, using different FCV strains in monovalent or bivalent compositions [24] . Current vaccines do not prevent infection, viral shedding, or the development of FCV-VSD, but can reduce or even prevent clinical symptoms [2, 7, 10] . Moreover, there are no specific antivirals available against FCV infections and treatment options for FCV-VSD are only limited to supportive therapy.

4|chunk|Several studies have reported different antiviral strategies against FCV [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] . One of the earliest attempts used phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMO) to treat cats during three FCV outbreaks (two caused by the FCV-VSD and one linked with a non-lethal FCV pathotype), showing promising results (79.6% vs. 9.7% of cats survived with or without PMO treatment, respectively) [27] .

5|chunk|Mefloquine, a human-approved pharmaceutical compound used to prevent or treat malaria, demonstrated an antiviral activity against FCV in vitro at low micromolar concentrations (half maximal effective concentration, EC 50 = 6.03 M), although it demonstrated a poor selectivity index (SI = 3.7). The in vitro combination treatment with mefloquine and recombinant feline interferon- showed only a slight improvement of the IC 50 [26] .

6|chunk|Another class of compounds tested against FCV includes protease inhibitors (PIs). Synthetic PIs such as GC376 and NPI52 have demonstrated antiviral activity against FCV (EC 50 = 35.2 M and 0.02 M, respectively). They were more effective against FCV when compared to the rhinovirus developmental PI rupintrivir (EC 50 > 50 M) and are considered broad-spectrum compounds showing additional activity against the feline coronavirus and human norovirus [29, 30] .

7|chunk|More recently, fexaramine, a synthetic agonist of the farnesoid X receptor, which plays a role in lipid metabolism, was shown to be effective at blocking FCV entry using in vitro assays, however, a single amino acid change (A539T) in the P2 domain of VP1 (the major capsid protein) was able to confer resistance [25] . In the same study, combination treatment with the aforementioned broad-spectrum PI (NPI52) showed synergistic antiviral activity (synergy log volume of 8.35 M 2 %) and delayed the emergence of virus resistance.

8|chunk|Viral non-structural proteins, such as the protease and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) are essential for viral replication, and therefore offer attractive antiviral targets. These enzymes lack host homologs, minimizing the chance of off-target effects and have been targeted successfully for the treatment of several viruses, including the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) [31, 32] . Using purified recombinant Pro-Pol, we established two in vitro assays for the screening of new FCV antiviral compounds. Representative nucleoside analogues (NAs), non-nucleoside inhibitors (NNIs), PIs, and the broad-spectrum nitazoxanide, were tested for FCV antiviral activity using both in vitro enzyme and cell culture-based methods. Here we identify two antiviral agents as potential therapeutic options for the FCV infection.
