1|chunk|The ease of travelling between cities has contributed much to globalization. Yet, it poses a threat on epidemic outbreaks. It is of great importance for network science and health control to understand the impact of frequent journeys on epidemics. We stress that a new framework of modelling that takes a traveller's viewpoint is needed. Such integrated travel network (ITN) model should incorporate the diversity among links as dictated by the distances between cities and different speeds of different modes of transportation, diversity among nodes as dictated by the population and the ease of travelling due to infrastructures and economic development of a city, and round-trip journeys to targeted destinations via the paths of shortest travel times typical of human journeys. An example is constructed for 116 cities in China with populations over one million that are connected by high-speed train services and highways. Epidemic spread on the constructed network is studied. It is revealed both numerically and theoretically that the traveling speed and frequency are important factors of epidemic spreading. Depending on the infection rate, increasing the traveling speed would result in either an enhanced or suppressed epidemic, while increasing the traveling frequency enhances the epidemic spreading.

2|chunk|Controlling an epidemic, e.g. severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), H1N1 swine influenza, and Ebola, in the midst of frequent movements of infected persons via cars, trains, and aeroplanes poses a challenging problem. In network science, much effort and progress has been made on understanding epidemics in single-layered networks 1-20 and multi-layered networks 21-28 . In single-layered static networks with an immobile agent at each node, for example, no finite epidemic threshold exists for scale-free (SF) networks and a tiny initial infection eventually spreads 11 . A delicate balance between the number of high degree nodes and the topological distance between them 29 is shown to be crucial. The same result holds for reaction-diffusion models with random diffusion of agents among nodes with infections only among the agents momentarily on the same node 6 . Recently, how human dynamics affects an epidemic has become the focus of research 14,18,30-33 , but the diversity of links and the time spending on journeys are largely ignored. Real-life networks, e.g. power grids and the internet, are often multi-layered networks 34,35 , with their mutual influence and cascades being hot research topics 36, 37 . Epidemics in two-layered networks also received much attention [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] , and the layer for infection processes actually shares the same set of nodes with the layer for information exchanges.

3|chunk|For diseases spreading through human contacts, it is most important to understand the impact of frequent journeys. There exist many single and multi-layered transportation network models 38-43 , with the layers representing networks of airports, railways, highways, etc. coupled together. To incorporate epidemics, however, random diffusion of people on such networks will be an oversimplification, as a journey involves a planned route to a destination using mixed modes of transportation. These directed movements should be incorporated in studying epidemics.
