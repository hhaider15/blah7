1|chunk|Human airway epithelial cells (HAECs) from normal subjects were obtained from nasal turbinates which were removed and discarded in the process giving access to the ethmoidal sinus (from the department of Ear, Nose and Throat, Hpital de la Croix-Rousse, Lyon, France). Patients were operated for tumours located in the ethmoidal region and had no respiratory disease.

2|chunk|Cells from control subjects and the patient were grown using the immerged cell culture previously described by Jorissen et al.

3|chunk|(1). Briefly, ciliated cells were isolated by pronase digestion overnight and expanded the day following the biopsy (J+1) in collagen-coated 25 cm 2 flasks (10-15,000 cells/cm 2 ) to de-differentiate in non-ciliated cells at 37C, 5% CO 2 .

4|chunk|When they reached 80-90% confluence, collagen was digested (J', 7-10 days post-seeding) and cells were suspended in flasks with rotation (inclination 10, 80 rpm) at 37C, to redifferentiate in the form of ciliated vesicles.

5|chunk|Cells were infected at J+1 or J+3. Non-ciliated cells were harvested at J+7 to 10 (J') and reciliated cells were fully re-differentiated at J'+28.

6|chunk|Cloning of DNAI1 cDNA To generate DNAI1 cDNA (AF091619), we extracted total RNA from ciliated HAECs with Extract-All (Eurobio, France), following manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was synthesized by using P5 specific primer (reverse: 5'-AAGGAACAGAACAAGAAGGGAA-3') and
