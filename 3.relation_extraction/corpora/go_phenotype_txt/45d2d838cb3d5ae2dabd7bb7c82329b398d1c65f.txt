1|chunk|The molecular basis of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV) induced pathology is still largely unclear. Many SARS patients suffer respiratory distress brought on by interstitial infiltration and frequently show peripheral blood lymphopenia and occasional leucopenia. One possible cause of this could be interstitial inflammation, following a localized host response. In this study, we therefore examine the immune response of SARS-CoV in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) over the first 24 hours.

2|chunk|Methods: PBMCs from normal healthy donors were inoculated in vitro with SARS-CoV and the viral replication kinetics was studied by real-time quantitative assays. SARS-CoV specific gene expression changes were examined by high-density oligonucleotide array analysis.

3|chunk|We observed that SARS-CoV was capable of infecting and replicating in PBMCs and the kinetics of viral replication was variable among the donors. SARS-CoV antibody binding assays indicated that SARS specific antibodies inhibited SARS-CoV viral replication. Array data showed monocyte-macrophage cell activation, coagulation pathway upregulation and cytokine production together with lung trafficking chemokines such as IL8 and IL17, possibly activated through the TLR9 signaling pathway; that mimicked clinical features of the disease.

5|chunk|Methods

6|chunk|PBMCs were obtained by Ficoll-Hypaque separation of whole blood. 2  10 5 PBMCs were seeded into each well of a 24-well culture plate, 0.5 ml of complete RPMI-1640 (Life Technologies-Invitrogen, USA) added to each and cultured overnight at 37C (5% CO 2 ). A seed stock of SARS-CoV (strain SIN 2774) passaged in Vero E6 cells was used for infection. Vero E6 culture supernatants were added to each well in 50 l volume at a concentration of 0.1 or 0.01 MOI (based on plaque forming units) and a control plate (media only). Each culture was set up in duplicate. After 4 hours of incubation, one set of the duplicate wells of the control plate and a 4 hours incubation plate were harvested while the rest received 0.5 ml media top-up and incubated for a further 2, 4, 6 and 8 days.

7|chunk|Harvesting was performed by gently flushing the wells with a Pasteur pipette to removed non-adherent cells, followed by a rinse of 1 ml RPMI. The rinsed fraction was pooled with the first harvest aliquot and spun at 1500 rpm. The cell pellet was washed twice with 2 ml RPMI to remove virus in the supernatant. 1.5 ml Trizol (Invitrogen, USA) was then added to the adherent cell fraction as well as the non-adherent cell fraction to lyse cells and stabilize the RNA. Extraction of total RNA was then performed following manufacturer's protocol and the resultant RNA dissolved in 40 l water.
