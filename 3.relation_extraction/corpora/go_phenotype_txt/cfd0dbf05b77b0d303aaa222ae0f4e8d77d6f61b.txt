1|chunk|Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is an emerging virus that was first reported in humans in June 2012 [1] . To date, MERS-CoV continues to infect humans with a fatality rate of~35%. At least 27 countries have reported human infections with MERS-CoV (https://www.who.int/emergencies/mers-cov/en/). MERS-CoV is a zoonotic virus. Like severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), MERS-CoV is believed to have originated from bats [2, 3] . However, whereas the bat-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV was likely mediated by palm civets as intermediate hosts, humans likely acquired MERS-CoV from dromedary camels [4] [5] [6] . Human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV does occur, but it is limited mostly to health care environments [7, 8] . Moreover, whereas SARS-CoV recognizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a cellular receptor [9,10], MERS-CoV uses dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) to enter target cells [11, 12] . Currently, no vaccines or antiviral therapeutics have been approved for the prevention or treatment of MERS-CoV infection, although a number of them have been developed preclinically and/or tested clinically [13] [14] [15] [16] .

2|chunk|The articles in this special issue of Viruses were written by researchers working in the MERS-CoV field. The main aims of this issue are to (i) better understand MERS-CoV transmission, epidemiology, and pathogenesis; (ii) summarize current progress on MERS-CoV animal models, vaccines, and therapeutics; and (iii) discuss future prospects for MERS-CoV research. This issue includes seven review articles and nine original research papers, each providing detailed updates on current MERS-CoV studies.

3|chunk|Studies on the transmission, epidemiology, and pathogenesis of MERS-CoV form one of the foundations of MERS-CoV research. In this issue, Farag and colleagues summarize the possible drivers of the emergence of MERS-CoV and its spillover to humans in Qatar, explaining the potential reasons for the camel-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV [17] . The review article by Song and colleagues provides an overall description of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and other important aspects of MERS-CoV [18] . Widagdo and colleagues review the host determinants of the transmission and pathogenesis of MERS-CoV, indicating that receptor DPP4 plays an important role in these processes [19] . A research article by Yan and colleagues characterizes the role of lipid profiles in the pathogenesis and infectivity of human coronaviruses, including MERS-CoV, suggesting that lipid metabolism may be involved in the propagations of these coronaviruses [20] . These reports provide insights into how MERS-CoV infects cells and spreads within and across host species. They have also laid the foundations for developing animal models.

Dromedary camels, alpacas, and non-human primates are susceptible to MERS-CoV infection [21] [22] [23] ; however, the virus does not infect small animals such as mice, hamsters, and ferrets [24] [25] [26] . Several mouse models that express human DPP4 (hDPP4) have been established for MERS-CoV infection [27] [28] [29] . In this issue, Widagdo and colleagues examine rabbits as potential hosts for MERS-CoV, showing that MERS-CoV infects rabbits without causing symptoms; they also analyze the route of MERS-CoV
