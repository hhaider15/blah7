Salvos were defined as two or three consecutive PVCs, and ventricular tachycardia (VT) was defined as a run of four or more consecutive ventricular premature beats 28 . Hematology (n = 34 SPF animals, n = 100 conventional animals). Whole blood (0.5 ml) was collected from the femoral artery catheter of SPF animals (n = 34) to measure complete blood counts using the VetScan HM5 analyser (REM Systems, Macquarie Park, New South Wales). The hematology results reported for conventional animals (n = 100) were from a study immediately prior to transitioning to SPF animals.

2|chunk|Coagulation parameters (n = 2 SPF animals; n = 2 conventional animals). Rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM  , Tem International, Munich, Germany) analysis was conducted on citrated whole blood samples according to manufacturer's instructions to measure clotting time (CT; sec), maximum clot firmness (MCF; mm), actual clot firmness 60 min after clot initiation (ACF; mm), and maximum clot lysis (ML; %) 29,30 . Assays included EXTEM (extrinsically-activated test using tissue factor) and APTEM (activation as for EXTEM with aprotonin). Aprotinin at low levels (10-50 KIU/mL) inhibits plasmin activation of fibrinolysis and plasmin-induced platelet activation 31 . Hyperfibrinolysis is defined as ML  15% 32,33 and confirmed with APTEM test.

3|chunk|Health screening, macropathology and histopathology (n = 2 SPF animals; n = 2 conventional animals). Two male rats from the James Cook University conventional Sprague-Dawley colony, two male SPF rats from the AITHM Small Animal Facility, and two male SPF rats acclimated for seven days in a conventional facility were sent to Cerberus Sciences (Adelaide, South Australia) for investigation by an independent Specialist Veterinary Pathologist. Enteric and respiratory bacteriology and endo-and ecto-parisitology assessments were performed using direct examination, culture, and PCR methods.
