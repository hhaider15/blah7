1|chunk|Bovine coronavirus (BCoV) is one of the main aetiological agents of gastroenteritis in calves, causing significant economic damage to livestock. This study aims to characterise BCoV genetically on the basis of the N gene. A total of 114 faecal samples from beef and dairy calves with or without clinical symptoms of diarrhoea from five Brazilian states (So Paulo, Minas Gerais, Santa Catarina, Mato Grosso and Bahia) were evaluated between 2008 and 2015 by technique of Semi-nested RT-PCR for gene N and genealogical analysis. Of the 114 samples analysed, 14.91% (17/114) were positive. BCoV was detected in 22.72% (10/44) of the animals with diarrhoea and in 10% (7/70) of asymptomatic animals. BCoV was identified in calves from rural properties located in all of the regions sampled. Genealogical analysis showed that the Brazilian sequences of BCoV for the gene which codes for the N protein can be broken down into two distinct clusters, and the samples from this study were closely linked to Asian strains. These results contribute to the molecular characterization of BCoV in Brazil and are the first report of the circulation of BCoV in the states of Santa Catarina and Bahia.
