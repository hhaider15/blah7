1|chunk|Background: Fidelity of DNA polymerases can be influenced by cation co-factors. Physiologically, Mg 2+ is used as a co-factor by HIV reverse transcriptase (RT) to perform catalysis; however, alternative cations including Mn 2+ , Co 2 + , and Zn 2+ can also support catalysis. Although Zn 2+ supports DNA synthesis, it inhibits HIV RT by significantly modifying RT catalysis. Zn 2+ is currently being investigated as a component of novel treatment options against HIV and we wanted to investigate the fidelity of RT with Zn 2+ . Methods: We used PCR-based and plasmid-based alpha complementation assays as well as steady-state misinsertion and misincorporation assays to examine the fidelity of RT with Mn 2+ , Co 2+ , and Zn 2+ .
