1|chunk|Mixed viral and bacterial infections are widely described in community-acquired pneumonia; however, the clinical implications of co-infection on the associated immunopathology remain poorly studied. In this study, microRNA, mRNA and cytokine/chemokine secretion profiling were investigated for human monocyte-derived macrophages infected in-vitro with Influenza virus A/H1N1 and/or Streptococcus pneumoniae. We observed that the in-vitro co-infection synergistically increased interferon-induced protein-10 (CXCL10, IP-10) expression compared to the singly-infected cells conditions. We demonstrated that endogenous miRNA-200a-3p, whose expression was synergistically induced following co-infection, indirectly regulates CXCL10 expression by targeting suppressor of cytokine signaling-6 (SOCS-6), a well-known regulator of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. Additionally, in a subsequent clinical pilot study, immunomodulators levels were evaluated in samples from 74 children (5 years-old) hospitalized with viral and/or bacterial community-acquired pneumonia. Clinically, among the 74 cases of pneumonia, patients with identified mixed-detection had significantly higher (3.6-fold) serum IP-10 levels than those with a single detection (P = 0.03), and were significantly associated with severe pneumonia (P < 0.01). This study demonstrates that viral and bacterial coinfection modulates the JAK-STAT signaling pathway and leads to exacerbated IP-10 expression, which could play a major role in the pathogenesis of pneumonia.

2|chunk|Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common inflammatory illness of the lungs that remains the major cause of pediatric mortality in low-and middle-income countries 1 . Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP) is the main causative agent of pneumonia; however, concomitant viral infection occurs in up to 66% of cases of CAP 2,3 . Clinical data suggest mixed infections are related to a higher severity of inflammatory disease 4,5 -especially in secondary pneumococcal infection following influenza virus (IAV) infection 6-8 -and mixed infection represents a relevant risk factor for pediatric intensive care hospitalization 9 . However, the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of mixed viral and bacterial infection remain poorly understood.
