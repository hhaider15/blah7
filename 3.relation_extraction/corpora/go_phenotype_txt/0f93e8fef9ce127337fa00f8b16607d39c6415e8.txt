1|chunk|Chicken gout resulting from nephropathogenic infectious bronchitis virus (NIBV) has become a serious kidney disease problem in chicken worldwide with alterations of the metabolic phenotypes in multiple metabolic pathways. To investigate the mechanisms in chicken responding to NIBV infection, we examined the global transcriptomic and metabolomic profiles of the chicken's kidney using RNA-seq and GC-TOF/MS, respectively. Furthermore, we analyzed the alterations in cecal microorganism composition in chickens using 16S rRNA-seq. Integrated analysis of these three phenotypic datasets further managed to create correlations between the altered kidney transcriptomes and metabolome, and between kidney metabolome and gut microbiome. We found that 2868 genes and 160 metabolites were deferentially expressed or accumulated in the kidney during NIBV infection processes. These genes and metabolites were linked to NIBV-infection related processes, including immune response, signal transduction, peroxisome, purine, and amino acid metabolism. In addition, the comprehensive correlations between the kidney metabolome and cecal microbial community showed contributions of gut microbiota in the progression of NIBV-infection. Taken together, our research comprehensively describes the host responses during NIBV infection and provides new clues for further dissection of specific gene functions, metabolite affections, and the role of gut microbiota during chicken gout. astrovirus (CAstV), and NIBV [4, 6, 7] . Currently, NIBV that causes visceral gout in chicken has become a research hotspot [6, 8] .

2|chunk|NIBV has become the most common IBV strain in the commercial poultry industry. It is a gamma Coronavirus in the Coronavirus family that exhibit strong renal tropism and has become one of the most familiar pathogens that induce visceral gout outbreaks [9] [10] [11] . Initially, some IBV strains have been called nephropathogenic IBV because the starting respiratory infection was followed by a heavy kidney infection. A large number of previous research findings indicate that clinical symptoms of nephropathogenic IBV strains infection include increased water consumption, depression, watery droppings, and significant mortality. Notably, necropsy of chicks that died during nephropathogenic IBV infection showed enlarged and pale kidneys and monosodium urate crystal deposition in the renal tubules and ureters [12] . According to histopathology, NIBV replicates on the epithelial surface of the kidney and causes particle degeneration, vacuolation, and desquamation of the tubular epithelium, as well as massive infiltration of heterophilic granulocytes in the stroma [13] . However, there is a substantial lack of understanding of the pathogenesis of NIBV infection. In addition, it is well known that the gut microbial community is closely associated with the progression of diseases, and Inoue et al. also confirmed that hepatitis C virus infection is associated with gut dysbiosis [14] . In our study, we focus on the cecum as organs of particular interest as they harbor the highest microbial cell densities (up to 10 11 cells g 1 ) and are significant sites for recycling of urea, water regulation, and carbohydrate fermentations [15, 16] . Therefore, we suspect that the gut microbiota may be associated with the progression of visceral gout induced by NIBV infection.

3|chunk|Nowadays, omics technology is increasingly being used to understand intricate biological systems and reveal the molecular characteristics behind complex cellular phenotypes [17, 18] . Applications of omics platforms include the identification of genes (genomics), messenger RNA (mRNA, transcriptomics), proteins (proteomics), and metabolites (metabolomics). Moreover, the research of the gut microbiota (microbiomics) has brought increasing concern due to its important affection for different diseases [19] . Many scholars have used multi-omics analysis to make great progress in deciphering the pathogenesis of diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease [20] , familial type 1 diabetes [21], autoimmune diseases [22] , and cardiovascular diseases [23] . However, to date, there has been very few omics analyses for the study of poultry diseases, and in particular, as far as we know, there is no omics analysis for the study of the pathogenesis of NIBV infection.

4|chunk|The antiviral and metabolic changes caused by viruses result in a highly complicated process that requires the coordination of diverse intertwined signalling and metabolic pathways. Therefore, a large-scale and comprehensive analysis of viral target tissues is needed to better understand the pathogenesis of the NIBV infection. We first replicated the visceral gout model by infecting chickens with NIBV and conducted an integrated transcriptomic, metabolomics, and microbiomics analyses. The characterization of these identified genes, metabolites, and microbiota clearly reflected the dynamic changes in the biological processes in chickens with NIBV infection. Overall, our research comprehensively describes the host responses during NIBV infection and provides new clues for further dissection of specific gene functions, metabolite affections, and the role of gut microbiota during chicken gout.
