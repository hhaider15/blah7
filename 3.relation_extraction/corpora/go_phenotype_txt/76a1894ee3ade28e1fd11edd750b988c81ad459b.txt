1|chunk|Flavivirus diseases such as dengue fever (DENV), West Nile virus (WNV), Zika and yellow fever represent a substantial global public health concern. Preexisting chronic conditions such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, obesity, and asthma were thought to predict risk of progression to severe infections.

2|chunk|We aimed to quantify the frequency of chronic comorbidities in flavivirus diseases to provide an estimate for their prevalence in severe and non-severe infections and examine whether chronic diseases contribute to the increased risk of severe viral expression.

3|chunk|We conducted a comprehensive search in PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE(R), Embase and Embase Classic and grey literature databases to identify studies reporting prevalence estimates of comorbidities in flavivirus diseases. Study quality was assessed with the risk of bias tool. Age-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were estimated for severe infection in the presence of chronic comorbidities.

4|chunk|We identified 65 studies as eligible for inclusion for DENV (47 studies) and WNV (18 studies). Obesity and overweight (i.e., BMI> 25 kg/m 2 , prevalence: 24.5%, 95% CI: 18.6-31.6%), hypertension (17.1%, 13.3-21.8%) and diabetes (13.3%, 9.3-18.8%) were the most prevalent comorbidities in DENV. However, hypertension (45.0%, 39.1-51.0%), diabetes (24.7%, 20.2-29.8%) and heart diseases (25.6%, 19.5-32.7%) were the most prevalent in WNV.
