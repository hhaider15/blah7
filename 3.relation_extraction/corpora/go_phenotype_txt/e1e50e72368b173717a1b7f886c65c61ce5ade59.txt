1|chunk|Here, we report the genome sequence of a divergent human rhinovirus C isolate identified from an infant with a severe community-acquired respiratory infection. RNA sequencing performed on an Illumina platform identified reads aligning to human rhinovirus species, which were de novo assembled to produce a coding-complete genome sequence.
