1|chunk|The liver disease is one of the most important traditional public health problems in Egypt. Oxidative stress is attributed to such pathological condition that further contributes to the initiation and progression of liver injury. In the present study, we have investigated if the strong antioxidant power of Nicotinamide (NA), Vitamin B2 (VB2), and Vitamin C (VC) can ameliorate TAA-induced oxidative stress-mediated liver injury in the rats. Methods: Thirty-six albino rats were divided into six groups: Control group; TAA group (IP injection with TAA at a dosage of 200 mg/Kg three times a week for two months); TAA + NA group (rats administered with NA at a dosage of 200 mg/kg daily besides TAA as in the control); TAA + VB2 group (rats administered with vitamin B2 at a dosage of 30 mg/kg daily besides injection with TAA); TAA + VC group (rats administered with vitamin C at a dosage of 200 mg/kg daily along with injection of TAA). TAA + NA + VB + VC group (rats administered the with the three vitamins daily in TAA pre-injected at the respective doses described above). Results: Treatment of rats with TAA led to a significant elevation of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), total bilirubin, cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-) in the serum samples. Moreover, malondialdehyde (MDA), hydroxyproline and nitic oxide (NO) were also significantly increased in the TAA-treated rats, while reduced glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) were significantly compromised in the hepatic samples. Rats administered with NA, VB2, and VC as individually or in combination ameliorated the deleterious effects of TAA that was confirmed by histopathology. However, the combination of the three vitamins was found more effective as compared to each of the vitamins. Conclusion: Our work demonstrates that NA, VB2, and VC cross-talk with each other that act as a more potent biochemical chain of antioxidant defense against TAA-induced toxicities in vivo.
