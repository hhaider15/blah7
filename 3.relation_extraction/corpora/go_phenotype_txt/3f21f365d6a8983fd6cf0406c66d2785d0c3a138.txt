1|chunk|The interferon (IFN)-regulated endoribonuclease RNase-L is involved in multiple aspects of the antimicrobial innate immune response. It is the terminal component of an RNA cleavage pathway in which dsRNA induces the production of RNase-L-activating 2-5A by the 2 1 -5 1 -oligoadenylate synthetase. The active nuclease then cleaves ssRNAs, both cellular and viral, leading to downregulation of their expression and the generation of small RNAs capable of activating retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptors or the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome. This leads to IFN expression and IL-1 activation respectively, in addition to broader effects on immune cell function. RNase-L is also one of a growing number of innate immune components that interact with the cell cytoskeleton. It can bind to several cytoskeletal proteins, including filamin A, an actin-binding protein that collaborates with RNase-L to maintain the cellular barrier to viral entry. This antiviral activity is independent of catalytic function, a unique mechanism for RNase-L. We also describe here the interaction of RNase-L with the E3 ubiquitin ligase and scaffolding protein, ligand of nump protein X (LNX), a regulator of tight junction proteins. In order to better understand the significance and context of these novel binding partners in the antimicrobial response, other innate immune protein interactions with the cytoskeleton are also discussed.

2|chunk|the mechanisms of RNase-L as a mediator of IFN activity, as well as identifying new physiologic roles [10] . Tumor suppressive activities, including antiproliferative and proapoptotic functions, were quickly ascribed and, in 2002, a genetic association was made when RNASEL was identified as the hereditary prostate cancer 1 (HPC1) locus on chromosome 1q25 [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . Novel roles and mechanisms have continued to emerge, such as the correlation between a 37 kDa truncated form of RNase-L and chronic fatigue syndrome [16] [17] [18] . Other non-canonical functions for RNase-L include the induction of senescence and shortened lifespan, cellular differentiation, colitis susceptibility, the demyelination of axons, lipid storage, and the development of diabetes [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . Although quite diverse, the mechanisms behind this regulation likely rely on transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of cellular mRNAs by RNase-L (reviewed in depth by Brennan-Laun et al.) [25] . More closely in line with its antiviral beginnings, the infection-associated role of RNase-L has been expanded in breadth to include antibacterial activity, immune cell regulation, the induction of IFN- and autophagy, and most recently, the maintenance of cytoskeletal integrity and barrier function [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] . This association with the cytoskeleton places RNase-L amongst a growing group of innate immune proteins that are regulated by, or interact with, the cellular architecture. The significance of this novel mechanism of innate immune regulation will be discussed in detail later in this review.
