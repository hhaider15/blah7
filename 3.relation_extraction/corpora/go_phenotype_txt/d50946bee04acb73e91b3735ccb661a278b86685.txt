1|chunk|Cellular RNA decay machinery plays a vital role in regulating gene expression by altering the stability of mRNAs in response to external stresses, including viral infection. In the primary infection, viruses often conquer the host cell's antiviral immune response by controlling the inherently cellular mRNA degradation machinery to facilitate viral gene expression and establish a successful infection. This review summarizes the current knowledge about the diverse strategies of viral-mediated regulatory RNA shutoff for pathogenesis, and particularly sheds a light on the mechanisms that viruses evolve to elude immune surveillance during infection.
