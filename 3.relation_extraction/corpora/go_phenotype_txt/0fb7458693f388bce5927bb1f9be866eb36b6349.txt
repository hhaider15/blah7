1|chunk|Introduction: Allergic reaction to dust mites is a relatively common condition among children, triggering cutaneous and respiratory responses that have a great impact on the health of this population. Anaphylactic hypersensitivity is characterized by an exacerbated response involving the production of regulatory cytokines responsible for stimulating the production of IgE antibodies.

2|chunk|Objective: To investigate an association of variants in cytokine genes (IL1A 2889 , IL1B ) between patients sensitive to dust mites and a control group.

3|chunk|Methods: A total of 254 patients were grouped as atopic and non-atopic according to sensitivity as evaluated by the Prick Test and to cytokine genotyping by the polymerase chain reaction-sequence specific primers (PCR-SSP) method using the Cytokine Genotyping Kit.

4|chunk|Blomia tropicalis and a non-atopic control group showed significant differences between allele and genotype frequencies in the regulatory regions of cytokine genes, with important evidence for IL4 2590 in T/C (10.2% vs. 43.1%, odd ratio [OR] = 0.15, p = 5.2 10 28 , pc = 0.0000011, and 95% confidence interval [95%CI] = 0.07-0.32) and T/T genotypes (42.9% vs. 13.8%, OR = 4.69, p = 2.5 10 26 , pc = 0.000055, and 95%CI = 2.42-9.09). Other associations were observed in the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL1A 2889 Conclusion: Our results suggest a possible association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in cytokine genes and hypersensitivity to dust mites.
