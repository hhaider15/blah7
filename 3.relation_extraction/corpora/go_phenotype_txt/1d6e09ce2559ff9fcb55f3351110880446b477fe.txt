1|chunk|There are currently no vaccines or antivirals available for dengue virus infection, which can cause dengue hemorrhagic fever and death. A better understanding of the host pathogen interaction is required to develop effective therapies to treat DENV. In particular, very little is known about how cellular RNA binding proteins interact with viral RNAs. RNAs within cells are not naked; rather they are coated with proteins that affect localization, stability, translation and (for viruses) replication.

2|chunk|Seventy-nine novel RNA binding proteins for dengue virus (DENV) were identified by crosslinking proteins to dengue viral RNA during a live infection in human cells. These cellular proteins were specific and distinct from those previously identified for poliovirus, suggesting a specialized role for these factors in DENV amplification. Knockdown of these proteins demonstrated their function as viral host factors, with evidence for some factors acting early, while others late in infection. Their requirement by DENV for efficient amplification is likely specific, since protein knockdown did not impair the cell fitness for viral amplification of an unrelated virus. The protein abundances of these host factors were not significantly altered during DENV infection, suggesting their interaction with DENV RNA was due to specific recruitment mechanisms. However, at the global proteome level, DENV altered the abundances of proteins in particular classes, including transporter proteins, which were down regulated, and proteins in the ubiquitin proteasome pathway, which were up regulated.

3|chunk|The method for identification of host factors described here is robust and broadly applicable to all RNA viruses, providing an avenue to determine the conserved or distinct mechanisms PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | through which diverse viruses manage the viral RNA within cells. This study significantly increases the number of cellular factors known to interact with DENV and reveals how DENV modulates and usurps cellular proteins for efficient amplification.

4|chunk|DENV is the most important mosquito transmitted viral disease in humans causing almost 400 million infections each year. Early detection is possible; however, there are no antivirals or vaccines available for this potentially lethal virus. Host factors that are required for viral amplification provide an attractive target for antiviral therapeutics for rapidly evolving RNA viruses. However, only a handful of DENV host factors are known. This study reports identification of 79 novel dengue RNA binding proteins using a largescale analysis of cellular proteins that interact with the DENV RNA during a live infection in human cells. Importantly, this analysis proved to have a remarkably low false discovery rate and the confirmed host factors appear to be specific to DENV without compromising the fitness of the cell for viral amplification of other unrelated viruses. Furthermore, these host factors were shown to be required at both early and late stages of the viral life cycle, consistent with the dynamic nature of dengue viral RNA.
