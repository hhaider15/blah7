1|chunk|Small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) modification (SUMOylation) is an important and widely used reversible modification system in eukaryotic cells. It regulates various cell processes, including protein targeting, transcriptional regulation, signal transduction, and cell division. To understand its role in the model lepidoptera insect Bombyx mori, a recombinant baculovirus was constructed to express an enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP)-SUMO fusion protein along with ubiquitin carrier protein 9 of Bombyx mori (BmUBC9). SUMOylation substrates from Bombyx mori cells infected with this baculovirus were isolated by immunoprecipitation and identified by LC-ESI-MS/MS. A total of 68 candidate SUMOylated proteins were identified, of which 59 proteins were functionally categorized to gene ontology (GO) terms. Analysis of kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathways showed that 46 of the identified proteins were involved in 76 pathways that mainly play a role in metabolism, spliceosome and ribosome functions, and in RNA transport. Furthermore, SUMOylation of four candidates (polyubiquitin-C-like isoform X1, 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, cyclin-related protein FAM58A-like and GTP-binding nuclear protein Ran) were verified by co-immunoprecipitation in Drosophila schneide 2 cells. In addition, 74% of the identified proteins were predicted OPEN ACCESS Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2014, 15 22012 to have at least one SUMOylation site. The data presented here shed light on the crucial process of protein SUMOylation in Bombyx mori.

2|chunk|Post-translational modifications (PTMs) involve the addition of a chemical group to the protein after it has been generated by the translational machinery. PTMs are essential for a variety of cellular processes and provide an important type of post-translational regulation. A large number of PTMs such as phosphorylation [1], methylation [2], acetylation [3], and glycosylation [4] are known and they regulate various Biol. processes such as transcriptional regulation [5] and protein degradation [6] . Small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) modification (SUMOylation), another type of PTM, is structurally related to ubiquitin. The 3-D structure of the human small ubiquitin-like modifier 1 (SUMO-1) protein is very similar to that of ubiquitin and in several instances SUMO competes with ubiquitin for a given lysine acceptor site, thereby preventing its subsequent poly-ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome [7, 8] . SUMO is believed to play roles in various cellular processes, including protein interaction, subcellular localization, and transcriptional regulation [9,10].

3|chunk|The conjugation of SUMO to target proteins is a cascade of enzymatic reactions: first, the SUMO proteins are processed by the SUMO protease that cleaves the C terminus of the nascent SUMO to expose the C-terminal di-glycine residue [11, 12] ; second, the exposed C-terminal residue forms a thioester bond with the activating enzymes SUMO-1 activating enzyme subunit 1(SAE1) (Aos1 in yeast) and SAE2 (Uba2 in yeast) in an adenosine-triphosphate (ATP)-dependent manner [13]; then the activated SUMO is transferred to the SUMO conjugating enzyme ubiquitin carrier protein 9 (UBC9) [7]; finally, the SUMO protein forms an isopeptide bond with substrate proteins, a reaction catalyzed by SUMO ligases such as protein inhibitor of activated STAT (PIAS), Ran-bingding protein 2 (RanBP2), or human PcG protein Pc2 [14, 15] . It is noteworthy that SUMOylation is also a dynamic progress. The SUMO protein can be cleaved from the substrates by the same proteases that process the SUMO precursor. Indeed, it has been reported in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that the balance between SUMO conjugation and deconjugation is critical for the normal growth of cells [16, 17] .

4|chunk|SUMO proteins are highly conserved in a large number of species and have been shown to be important in many eukaryotic cell processes. In humans, at least four SUMO proteins have been found, with 44% amino acid identity between SUMO-1 and SUMO-2/3 and 86% amino acid identity between the closely related SUMO-2 and SUMO-3. It has been reported that the Nematode SUMO protein shows greater similarity to the vertebrate SUMO-1 protein [18] , while the SUMO protein from Drosophila appears to be more similar to the vertebrate SUMO-2/3 proteins [19] . The genome of the silkworm Bombyx mori has one copy of the sumo gene; the small ubiquitin-like modifier of Bombyx mori (BmSUMO) protein shows greater similarity to the vertebrate SUMO-2/3 proteins, sharing 67% identity with human SUMO-2/3 and 61% identity with human SUMO-4, but only 51.6% identity with human SUMO-1.
