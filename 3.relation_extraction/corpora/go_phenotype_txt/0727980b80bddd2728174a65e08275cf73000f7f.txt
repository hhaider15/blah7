1|chunk|Gut health is the starting place for maintaining the overall health of an animal. Strategies to maintain gut health are, thus, an important part in achieving the goal of improving animal health. A new strategy to do this involves two molecules: the iron transport protein ovotransferrin (IT) and -tocopheryl polyethylene glycol succinate (TPGS), which result in the novel formulation of ITPGS. These molecules help reduce gut pathogens, while enhancing the absorption and bioavailability of therapeutic drugs, phytomedicines, and nanomedicines. This, in turn, helps to maintain normal health in animals. Maintaining the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) in its normal condition is key for successful absorption and efficacy of any nutrient. A compromised GIT, due to an imbalance (dysbiosis) in the GIT microbiome, can lead to an impaired GI barrier system with impaired absorption and overall health of the animal. The molecules in ITPGS may address the issue of poor absorption by keeping the GI system healthy by maintaining the normal microbiome and improving the absorption of nutrients through multiple mechanisms involving antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and antimicrobial activities. The ITPGS technology can allow the dose of active pharmaceutical or herbal medicine to be significantly reduced in order to attain equal or better efficacy. With complimentary actions between IT and TPGS, ITPGS presents a novel approach to increase the bioavailability of drugs, phytoconstituents, nutrients, and nanomedicines by enhanced transport to the tissues at the site of action, while reducing gut pathogen load. The ITPGS approach appears to be a novel strategy for maintaining the health of animals by manipulation of microbiota.

2|chunk|Molecules 2019, 24, 4289 2 of 20 bioenhancers of herbal and non-herbal origins are indicated for drugs and phytochemicals [9] [10] [11] . The use of bioenhancers and potentiators dates back thousands of years [12] [13] [14] . Piperine from black pepper appears to be the first example of Yogvahi (herbs that are able to increase or potentiate the plasma concentration of drugs) mentioned in Ayurvedic medicine [15] [16] [17] [18] . In other in vivo studies, peppermint oil has been reported to increase bioavailability of cyclosporine [19] , and ginseng polysaccharides have been reported to enhance absorption of ginsenoside Rb1 [20] .

3|chunk|In in vivo studies, Yurdakok-Dikmen et al. [11] reported that following oral administration, the biodegradation of herbal drugs occurs in the stomach or gut lumen, where membrane permeability and metabolism are key factors in absorption. Bioenhancers are from various classes and exert their effects via multiple mechanisms, such as enzymatic alterations, phytosome formulations, transporter protein alterations, cholagogue/cholerectic effect, and thermogenesis. Absorption of drugs/phytoconstituents can be enhanced by employing various strategies, such as manipulating formulation (micronization, nanocrystals/nanosuspensions, solid solutions, self-dispersing solid solutions with surfactants, lipid solutions, self-emulsifying drug delivery systems, and surfactant-cosolvent systems) [11, 21] .

4|chunk|In a number of in vivo studies, properties of TPGS (vitamin E TPGS) have been described to enhance the delivery of drugs, nutraceuticals, nanoparticles, and dietary nutrients [6, 22] . The poor water solubility of vitamin E limits its absorption in the GIT, but esterification of vitamin E succinate with polyethylene glycol (PEG) 1000 makes it completely water soluble [6, [23] [24] [25] . TPGS has an amphiphilic structure comprising of a hydrophilic polar head portion and lipophilic alkyl tail. It can be functionalized as an excellent solubilizer, emulsifier, and permeation and bioavailability enhancer of hydrophobic drugs and nutraceuticals [6, [26] [27] [28] [29] . TPGS can also be used in the development of nanomedicines, focusing on simple structures with multifunctional properties [6, 29, 30] . Of course, the preparation of nanomedicines is still at the laboratory scale and progress on developing novel nanomedicines is relatively slow. In both in vitro and in vivo studies, TPGS has also been shown to exhibit additional properties, such as a surfactant, apoptogenic, anticancer, immunomodulator, neuroprotection, and reversal of multidrug resistance (MDR) by inhibiting P-glycoprotein (P-gp) activity [6, 29, [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] . TPGS 1000 (1000 denoting the PEG chain molecular weight) has been approved by the FDA as a GRAS supplement to solubilize drugs in oral, parenteral, topical, nasal, and rectal/vaginal therapies [31, [37] [38] [39] . TPGS has also been approved by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) as a safe pharmaceutical adjuvant used in drug formulation and for research purposes [39] [40] [41] .

5|chunk|Vitamin E TPGS is a powerful tool in the formulation of poorly-soluble lipophilic compounds, as it enhances absorption and bioavailability via efficient micellar uptake into enterocytes. TPGS has a proven record of safety and efficacy in pharmaceutical, dietary supplement, food and beverage, personal care, animal nutrition, and cannabinoid products. It has the added benefit of being a clean label ingredient. In order to achieve greater stability, bioavailability, additional biological/pharmacological effects, and better therapeutic efficacy, TPGS technology has been further improvised by combining the iron transport (IT) protein of ovotransferrin with TPGS. The formulation of Iron Transport Polyethylene Glycol Succinate (ITPGS) is soluble in both fat and water and exerts multiple biological and pharmacological effects, such as antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, immunomodulatory, healthy gut, and overall health improvement. This review describes various facets of ITPGS, including formulation, biological properties, pharmacological mechanisms, and therapeutic efficacy.

6|chunk|d--Tocopheryl polyethylene glycol succinate (TPGS) is prepared from natural lipid-soluble -tocopherol (vitamin E) by grafting to a polyethylene glycol (PEG) oligomer through a succinate diester linker [30] . The iron transport polyethylene glycol succinate (ITPGS) molecule, in addition to natural -tocopherol, incorporates the iron transport aspect from ovotransferrin (formerly known as conalbumin) obtained from egg-white or its hydrolysates [42] [43] [44] [45] . The structural formula of ITPGS (IT.TPGS) is shown in Figure 1 .
