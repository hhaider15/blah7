1|chunk|In order for a virus to persist, there must be a balance between viral replication and immune clearance. It is commonly believed that adaptive immunity drives clearance of viral infections and, thus, dysfunction or viral evasion of adaptive immunity is required for a virus to persist. Type I interferons (IFNs) play pleiotropic roles in the antiviral response, including through innate control of viral replication. Murine norovirus (MNoV) replicates in dendritic cells (DCs) and type I IFN signaling in DCs is important for early control of MNoV replication. We show here that the non-persistent MNoV strain CW3 persists systemically when CD11c positive DCs are unable to respond to type I IFN. Persistence in this setting is associated with increased early viral titers, maintenance of DC numbers, increased expression of DC activation markers and an increase in CD8 T cell and antibody responses. Furthermore, CD8 T cell function is maintained during the persistent phase of infection and adaptive immune cells from persistently infected mice are functional when transferred to Rag1 -/recipients. Finally, increased early replication and persistence are also observed in mixed bone marrow chimeras where only half of the CD11c positive DCs are unable to respond to type I IFN. These findings demonstrate that increased early viral replication due to a cellintrinsic innate immune deficiency is sufficient for persistence and a functional adaptive immune response is not sufficient for viral clearance.

2|chunk|In vertebrates, innate immunity provides early control of viral infection and initiates adaptive immunity. It is generally thought that a virus must either avoid or evade an adaptive immune response to persist within a vertebrate host. The role of innate immunity in preventing viral persistence, apart from its role in initiating an adaptive response, is not completely understood. Type I interferon (IFN) is a cytokine with pleiotropic roles in the antiviral response, including innate control of viral replication. Murine norovirus (MNoV) replicates in cells of the innate immune system, including dendritic cells (DCs), and IFN signaling in DCs is important for early control of MNoV replication. We found here that MNoV persists when DCs are unable to respond to type I IFN. MNoV persistence is correlated with increased adaptive immune responses, likely reflective of increased early viral replication. MNoV also persists in chimeric mice with a 50% mix of wildtype and type I IFN receptor deficient DCs, consistent with a cell-intrinsic role for IFN responses in preventing MNoV persistence. These findings demonstrate that an innate immune deficiency can result in viral persistence apart from its role in generating an adaptive immune response.
