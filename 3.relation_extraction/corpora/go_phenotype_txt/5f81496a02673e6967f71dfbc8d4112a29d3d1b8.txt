1|chunk|selected H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2 subtype strains. 3-SL has minimum inhibitory concentration values of 15.62 mM or less in more than half of the viruses examined. 3-SL also showed effective inactivation of H9N2 Korea isolate (A/Chicken/Korea/MS96/1996) at 12.5 mM concentration in Madin Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cell line. Thus, 3-SL was further studied for in vivo study against H9N2 virus in pathogen free chicken experiment models. In vivo study exhibited improved clinical symptoms on H9N2 infected chickens when treated with 3-SL. Moreover, treating chickens with 3-SL resulted in complete elimination of H9N2 viruses within 24 h of virus infection (0.8 HAU of H9N2). Indirect ELISA assay confirmed complete wash-out of H9N2 viruses from the colon after neutralization by 3-SL without entering the blood stream. These in vivo results open up possible applications of 3-SL for the prevention of AI virus infections in birds by a simple cleansing mechanism.
