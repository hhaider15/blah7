1|chunk|There was a lot of discussion about communication at the lecture seminar, and it was quite surprising. Among several lessons left by the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) epidemic last year, the most significant one is the realization of the importance of communication in a crisis situation.

2|chunk|Unlike scientists and experts who recognize risk based on scientific evidence, the general population tends to have more fear and perceive more risk than the actual risk itself due to uncertainties created by insufficient and inaccurate information. Therefore, risk communication plays a major role in reducing the gap between real and perceived risk, and in effectively delivering accurate information. As a result of the failure of risk communication about MERS, the social and economic disturbance was enormous, and the importance of risk communication was realized in other fields such as healthcare. This is one of the outcomes of experiencing the severity of the MERS epidemic.

However, communication is a complex process that requires not only consideration of content, but also consideration of how, to whom, at what point, and through which channel to deliver the content. Risk communication must also consider the nature of risk, people's characteristics affecting their risk perceptions, and the complex media environment. Thus, communication experts should be involved with health and medical professionals from the very beginning of the response to a public health crisis.
