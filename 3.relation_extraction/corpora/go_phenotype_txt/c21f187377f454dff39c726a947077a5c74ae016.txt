1|chunk|The Florida manatee (Trichechus manatus latirotris) is a threatened aquatic mammal in United States coastal waters. Over the past decade, the appearance of papillomavirusinduced lesions and viral papillomatosis in manatees has been a concern for those involved in the management and rehabilitation of this species. To date, three manatee papillomaviruses (TmPVs) have been identified in Florida manatees, one forming cutaneous lesions (TmPV1) and two forming genital lesions (TmPV3 and TmPV4). We identified DNA sequences with the potential to form G-quadruplex structures (G4) across the three genomes. G4 were located on both DNA strands and across coding and non-coding regions on all TmPVs, offering multiple targets for viral control. Although G4 have been identified in several viral genomes, including human PVs, most research has focused on canonical structures comprised of three Gtetrads. In contrast, the vast majority of sequences we identified would allow the formation of non-canonical structures with only two G-tetrads. Our biophysical analysis confirmed the formation of G4 with parallel topology in three such sequences from the E2 region. Two of the structures appear comprised of multiple stacked two G-tetrad structures, perhaps serving to increase structural stability. Computational analysis demonstrated enrichment of G4 sequences on all TmPVs on the reverse strand in the E2/E4 region and on both strands in the L2 region. Several G4 sequences occurred at similar regional locations on all PVs, most notably on the reverse strand in the E2 region. In other cases, G4 were identified at similar regional locations only on PVs forming genital lesions. On all TmPVs, G4 sequences were located in the non-coding region near putative E2 binding sites. Together, these findings suggest that G4 are possible regulatory elements in TmPVs. /). Support for G-quadruplex structures (G4) are four-stranded, inter-and intramolecular structures formed from guanine-rich DNA and RNA sequences. The sequences can be identified by four tracts of two or more guanine bases that are separated by one or more nucleotides of varying composition. The sequences fold to form stacks of G-tetrads, planar structures composed of four guanine bases held together by Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds (Fig 1) [1] . The stacked G-tetrads are connected by loops which vary in size and sequence composition. The number of G-tetrads, the loop lengths, and the loop sequence composition are all known to affect the stability of the folded structure, with higher numbers of G-tetrads and shorter loop lengths tending toward greater stability [2, 3] .

2|chunk|G4 are known to be involved in a series of key biological functions. In humans, G4 are found in telomeric repeats and serve to prevent degradation and genomic instability [4] . Their formation in this region is also known to decrease telomerase activity which is selectively expressed in a vast majority of cancers [5] . G4 located in the promoter region of genes act as transcriptional regulators [6] while those found in intronic and exonic regions play a role in alternative splicing [7, 8] . In RNA, G4 identified in 3' and 5' untranslated regions are known to regulate protein synthesis [9, 10] .

3|chunk|G4 function as regulators through at least a couple of different mechanisms [1]. Their formation can inhibit transcription by blocking the activity of RNA polymerase. Alternatively, G4 can bind with other regulatory elements that either activate or repress transcription. A variety of different proteins are now known to bind with G4 in DNA and RNA [11] . In RNA, this includes proteins involved in splicing as well as protein synthesis [12] .

4|chunk|Although much of the research on G4 is focused on humans, a regulatory role for G4 in prokaryotic cells is currently being established. In Escherichia coli, G4 are capable of forming and altering expression levels [13] , and in Neisseria gonorrhea, a G4 structure plays a critical role in antigenic variation [14] . Several G4 sequences have been identified in the promotor region of the human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) where ligand stabilization of a G4 located in the Nef gene reduced gene expression and repressed HIV-1 infectivity in an antiviral Fig 1.
