0|chunk|molecules Targeting Cell Entry of Enveloped Viruses as an Antiviral Strategy

1|chunk|The entry of enveloped viruses into their host cells involves several successive steps, each one being amenable to therapeutic intervention. Entry inhibitors act by targeting viral and/or cellular components, through either the inhibition of protein-protein interactions within the viral envelope proteins or between viral proteins and host cell receptors, or through the inhibition of protein-lipid interactions. Interestingly, inhibitors that concentrate into/onto the membrane in order to target a protein involved in the entry process, such as arbidol or peptide inhibitors of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), could allow the use of doses compatible with therapeutic requirements. The efficacy of these drugs validates entry as a point of intervention in viral life cycles. Strategies based upon small molecule antiviral agents, peptides, proteins or nucleic acids, would most likely prove efficient in multidrug combinations, in order to inhibit several steps of virus life cycle and prevent disease progression.
