1|chunk|The genus Phlebovirus of the family Bunyaviridae contains a number of emerging virus species which pose a threat to both human and animal health. Most prominent members include Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), sandfly fever Naples virus (SFNV), sandfly fever Sicilian virus (SFSV), Toscana virus (TOSV), Punta Toro virus (PTV), and the two new members severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) and Heartland virus (HRTV). The nonstructural protein NSs is well established as the main phleboviral virulence factor in the mammalian host. NSs acts as antagonist of the antiviral type I interferon (IFN) system. Recent progress in the elucidation of the molecular functions of a growing list of NSs proteins highlights the astonishing variety of strategies employed by phleboviruses to evade the IFN system. Despite their obvious capacity for causing human and veterinary disease, as well as potential associated economic losses, only few phleboviruses are adequately characterized in terms of their interaction with the mammalian host organism. In this review, we will attempt to provide an overview spanning both the current knowledge about the activation of the type I interferon (IFN) system by phleboviruses, as well as the broadening spectrum of their IFN-antagonistic strategies.

2|chunk|Phleboviruses are arboviruses that are taxonomically divided into dipteran-and tick-borne viruses. Dipteran-borne phleboviruses are generally found in eponymous Phlebotomus sandflies [22, 31] , with RVFV representing an outlier that is associated with Aedes and Culex mosquitoes, and more promiscuous in its vector range. The specific vector species are thought to be predominantly responsible for the maintenance of the viruses by vertical (transovarial) transmission, the geographic distribution of the virus and the spatial and temporal occurrence of the specific disease. Given the increasing spread of competent vector species, concerns have been raised about the potential introduction of RVFV into new areas with both susceptible vectors and hosts, and potential consequences for the human population and massive economic loss caused among affected livestock [32, 33] .

3|chunk|The epidemiological potential of the phleboviruses has been underscored by the recent identification of two new members as the causative agents of severe human disease [23] . In rural regions of China, cumulative cases of a febrile illness accompanied by thrombocytopenia, leukocytopenia, multiple organ dysfunction, and a high case-fatality rate led to the discovery of a novel phlebovirus, SFTSV, transmitted by Haemaphysalis longicornis ticks [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] . Since its discovery, SFTSV and associated cases have also been reported from Japan and Korea [39] [40] [41] . In North America, nearly simultaneously-occurring cases of a similar set of symptoms were shown to be caused by a related, tick-transmitted phlebovirus termed Heartland virus (HRTV) [42, 43] . Thus, while tick-borne phleboviruses were long thought to be negligible with respect to public health, the emergence of SFTSV and HRTV suggested that this perception needed reevaluation. As one result, the genome sequences of members of the Bhanja virus (BHAV) serogroup, which has been associated with febrile illness, were determined and re-classified into the tick-borne phlebovirus group [10, 44] .
