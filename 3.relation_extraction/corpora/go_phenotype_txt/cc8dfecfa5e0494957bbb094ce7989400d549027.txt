1|chunk|: Synthesis of JMN3-003, 35.4 mmol), 1-fluoro-2-nitrobenzene (3.8 ml, 36.0 mmol) and Et 3 N (4.93 ml, 35.4 mmol) were mixed in a microwave tube and heated at 150C for one hour. The mixture was stirred in water, ether added and the precipitate filtered. The reddish brown solid was washed with hexanes and dried under vacuum to give 8.0 g of substance (3) in 94% yield. 1 H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl 3,  = 7.24 ppm);  87 s , 1H), 10.01 (s , 1H), 8.18 (dd, J = 8.0, 1.6 Hz, 1H), 7.33-6.68 (m, 7H), 3.83 (s, 3H). For synthesis of N-(4-methoxyphenyl)benzene-1,2diamine (substance (4) in supplement 1), 10% Pd/C (300.0 mg, 0.282 mmol) was added to a
