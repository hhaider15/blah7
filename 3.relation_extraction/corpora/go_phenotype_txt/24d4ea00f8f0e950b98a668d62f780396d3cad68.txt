1|chunk|In recent years, there has been an increasing appreciation of the importance of secreted and extracellular proteins that traditionally have been considered as intracellular components. Vimentin is a highly abundant intermediate filament protein, and its intracellular functions have been investigated in a large number of studies. Recently, however, vimentin has been shown to take part in significant processes outside the cell. Our understanding of the functions of extracellular vimentin is, however, limited. In this study we demonstrate that a vimentin specific antibody, obtained by phage antibody technology, promotes tube formation of endothelial cells in a 2D matrigel assay. By binding vimentin, the antibody increases the tube formation by 21% after 5 hours of incubation. Addition of the antibody directly to cultured endothelial cells does not influence endothelial cell migration or proliferation. The enhanced tube formation can be seen for up to 10 hours where after the effect decreases. It is shown that the antibody-binding site is located on the coil 2 domain of vimentin. To our knowledge this is the first study that demonstrates an enhanced tube formation by binding vimentin in a 2D matrigel assay under normoxic conditions.

2|chunk|The intermediate filament protein vimentin exert important intracellular functions, regulating processes like cell migration and sustaining cell integrity. The importance of vimentin-mediated processes was underestimated for years, mainly because vimentin deficient (vim / ) mice initially were described as displaying virtually normal phenotypes and no apparent physiological defects were observed 1 . Eventually, more detailed studies on vim / mice revealed that vimentin has key functions in events of cell signalling, migration and adhesion 2, 3 . The 57 kDa type III intermediate filament protein, consists of a head-, rod-and tail domain and can be post-translationally modified. A large number of phosphorylation sites have been characterised, especially on the head domain where the phosphorylation status regulate filament assembly 4, 5 . Deamination of arginine residues in the head domain leads to citrullination, which may be important in inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis 6 . Vimentin may be further modified by addition of N-Acetylglucosamine or act as a specific target for glycation 7-9 . In addition, proteolytic cleavage by specific caspases and calpain further modify vimentin 10, 11 . Apart from the influence of post-translational modification on filament assembly, the functional effects of modification still remain largely unknown. Possibly due to the high intracellular abundance of vimentin, the extracellular localisation and possible functions has only been described in the last 15 years. Initially, vimentin was found on the surface of activated macrophages, but more recently it has been found on the surface of more cells including circulating tumour cells 12-14 . How the vimentin-mediated processes are regulated remains elusive, and it seems that vimentin is a highly dynamic molecule with tissue specific functions 15-17 . Vimentin has been shown to take part in viral and bacterial infections and may be a key partner in neuronal regeneration [18] [19] [20] [21] . It has been suggested that vimentin may serve as a potential anti-angiogenic target, however, results are contradicting 22-24 . As angiogenesis is an essential part of sustaining oxygen supply in health as well as in disease, potential anti-angiogenic targets have to be carefully evaluated to avoid severe adverse effects by the anti-angiogenic treatment 13 . The ability to form new blood vessels is diminished with age. To increase our cellular and biochemical understanding of this age related decline in angiogenesis, we have previously established long-term in cultivation of endothelial cells 25 . We established that the ability of the endothelial cells to form tube like structures when grown on matrigel decline when allowed to age in culture 25 . To identify change of endothelial cell expression profile that correlates with the loss of ability to form tubes, we applied the phage antibody technology as a discovery tool. The Tomlinson I+J library was applied to select single chain fragment variable (scFv) antibodies against proteins of ageing HUVEC cells by the phage display technology 26, 27 . One of these antibodies, named LOB7, displays pro-angiogenic features in 2D

The blockage of functional epitopes combined with detailed mechanistic studies most likely will pave the way for increased understanding of extracellular vimentin and possibly provide new leads to treat human disease.

5|chunk|in vivo biotinylation protocol developed by the group of Dario Neri 28 , a selection of antibodies was performed against biotinylated proteins from HUVEC cells. In total 384 clones were picked and monoclonal phage antibodies were produced followed by sceening for their binding to HUVEC and HMEC-1 cells by phage antibody ELISA ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ). One of the antibodies selected for further investigation was LOB7. Initial characterisation by ICC showed that LOB7 bound more to old ASF-2 (passage 52) than to young ASF-2 (passage 10) ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ).
