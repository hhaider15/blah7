1|chunk|The report by Gaussen et al details the association between SKP2 and autophagy and how these pathways effect MERS-CoV replication. In this report, comprised of 2 large connected sets of data, SKP2 and its association with BECN1 is examined for their roles in regulating autophagy. The authors identify how SKP2 effects BECN1 levels via ubiquitination and how inhibition of SKP2 by either siRNA or inhibitory compounds effect BECN1 and autophagy. The report then presents data on the role of autophagy and MERS-CoV where live virus and individual MERS-CoV proteins are shown to effect autophagy flux. The large amount of data is technically impressive however significant questions arose on this review.
