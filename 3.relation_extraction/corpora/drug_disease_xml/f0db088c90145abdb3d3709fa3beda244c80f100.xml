Here, we used whole-transcriptome sequencing (RNASeq) and ribosome profiling (RiboSeq) to delineate gene expression in the IBV M41-CK and Beau-R strains at subcodon resolution. RNASeq facilitated a comparative analysis of viral RNA synthesis and revealed two novel transcription junction sites in the attenuated Beau-R strain, one of which would generate a sgmRNA encoding a ribosomally occupied open reading frame (dORF) located downstream of the nucleocapsid coding region. RiboSeq permitted quantification of the translational efficiency of virus gene expression and identified, for the first time, sites of ribosomal pausing on the genome. Quantification of reads flanking the programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) signal at the genomic RNA ORF1a/ORF1b junction revealed that PRF in IBV is highly efficient (33 to 40%). Triplet phasing of RiboSeq data allowed precise determination of reading frames and revealed the translation of two ORFs (ORF4b and ORF4c on sgmRNA IR), which are widely conserved across IBV isolates. Analysis of differential gene expression in infected primary chick kidney cells indicated that the host cell response to IBV occurs primarily at the level of transcription, with global upregulation of immune-related mRNA transcripts following infection and comparatively modest changes in the translation efficiencies of host genes. Cellular genes and gene networks differentially expressed during virus infection were also identified, giving insights into the host cell response to IBV infection. IMPORTANCE IBV is a major avian pathogen and presents a substantial economic burden to the poultry industry. Improved vaccination strategies are urgently needed to curb the global spread of this virus, and the development of suitable vaccine candidates will be aided by an improved understanding of IBV molecular biology. Our high-resolution data have enabled a precise study of transcription and translation in cells infected with both pathogenic and attenuated forms of IBV and expand our understanding of gammacoronaviral gene expression. We demonstrate that gene expression shows considerable intraspecies variation, with single nucleotide polymorphisms being associated with altered production of sgmRNA transcripts, and our Ri-boSeq data sets enabled us to uncover novel ribosomally occupied ORFs in both strains. The numerous cellular genes and gene networks found to be differentially expressed during virus infection provide insights into the host cell response to IBV infection.">

IBV infects primarily the epithelial cells of upper and lower respiratory tract tissues, though infections can also spread to the alimentary canal, as well as to the kidneys, testes, and oviduct (2). The monopartite, polycistronic genomic RNA (gRNA) of IBV is approximately 27 kb in length, and like the gRNAs of other coronaviruses, it is 5= methyl capped and 3= polyadenylated (3). Two large open reading frames (ORFs)-ORF1a and ORF1b-are situated within the 5= proximal two-thirds of the genome. Translation of the former yields a ca. 3,950-amino-acid (aa) polyprotein (pp1a), whereas translation of the latter requires Ϫ1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) (4, 5), giving rise to a ca. 6,630-aa polyprotein (pp1ab). These polyproteins are cleaved to yield the components of the membrane-bound replication-transcription complex (RTC) (6-8). A feature of coronavirus replication is the synthesis of a nested, 3=-coterminal set of subgenomic mRNAs (sgmRNAs) encoding the viral structural and accessory proteins. The 5= end of each sgmRNA comprises a 56-nucleotide (nt) sequence derived from the 5= end of the genome, the so-called leader sequence (9, 10). Incorporation of the leader occurs as a result of polymerase hopping-or discontinuous transcription-during negativestrand synthesis. When the RTC encounters specific body transcription regulatory sequences (TRS-Bs), the nascent negative strand can re-pair with a closely homologous leader TRS (TRS-L) at the 3= end of the leader, after which the viral polymerase completes negative-strand synthesis using the leader as the template (Fig. 1A , diamond symbols) (8-14). Subsequently, the RTC synthesizes positive-strand copies of the negative-strand genomic and sgmRNAs.">

While M41-CK is restricted to growth in primary chicken cells, Beau-R is capable of replicating in both avian and nonavian cell lines, including Vero (African green monkey kidney-derived) and baby hamster kidney cells (17) (18) (19) (20) . Polymorphisms in the spike (S) glycoprotein subunit 2 (S2), which spans the viral membrane, have been shown to be responsible for this variation in host cell tropism (21). Moreover, the S protein of M41-CK-but not that of Beau-R-elicits an immunoprotective response in vivo, although recombinant transfer of the protein from the former to the latter does not restore pathogenicity (22). The extent to which these strains diverge in terms of virus gene expression or in terms of host cell gene expression in response to infection has not been investigated in detail.">
