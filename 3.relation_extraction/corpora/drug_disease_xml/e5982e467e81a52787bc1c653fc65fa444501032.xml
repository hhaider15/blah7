  <chunk id="e5982e467e81a52787bc1c653fc65fa444501032.c1" text="Current evidence suggests that environmental changes and interactions between wildlife, livestock, and humans contribute to the spillover of infectious agents from bats to other hosts [1]. An increasing number of studies investigating the diversity and infection dynamics of bat pathogens has recently been published; however, how these infectious agents are transmitted both within bat populations and to other hosts, including humans, often remains unknown."/>

Although bats are recognized as major reservoir hosts of emerging infectious diseases, we highlight that a significant knowledge gap on transmission mechanisms remains and needs further exploration."/>
