  <chunk id="d1913c3e3106846c33b96d7276edc1d2a62b1a1e.c1" text="Background: In prolonged hemorrhagic shock, reductions in intestinal mucosal blood perfusion lead to mucosal barrier damage and systemic inflammation. Gastrointestinal failure in critically ill patients has a poor prognosis, so early assessment of mucosal barrier injury in shock patients is clinically relevant. Unfortunately, there is no serum marker that can accurately assess intestinal ischemia-reperfusion injury."/>

  <chunk id="d1913c3e3106846c33b96d7276edc1d2a62b1a1e.c4" text="The severity of hemorrhagic shock in the low BP group was significantly greater than that of the medium BP group according to the post-resuscitation BP, serum tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a, and arterial lactate. Intestinal damage was significantly more severe in the low BP group according to Chiu's scoring, claudin-1, intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, and myeloperoxidase expression. Serum diamine oxidase was significantly increased in the low BP group compared to the medium BP and control groups and was negatively correlated with shock BP.">
