G-quadruplexes are present in eukaryotes, prokaryotes, and viruses. In the latter, mounting evidence indicates their key biological activity. Since data on viruses are scattered, we here present a comprehensive analysis of potential quadruplex-forming sequences (PQS) in the genome of all known viruses that can infect humans. We show that occurrence and location of PQSs are features characteristic of each virus class and family. Our statistical analysis proves that their presence within the viral genome is orderly arranged, as indicated by the possibility to correctly assign up to twothirds of viruses to their exact class based on the PQS classification. For each virus we provide: i) the list of all PQS present in the genome (positive and negative strands), ii) their position in the viral genome, iii) the degree of conservation among strains of each PQS in its genome context, iv) the statistical significance of PQS abundance. This information is accessible from a database to allow the easy navigation of the results: http://www. medcomp.medicina.unipd.it/main_site/doku.php?id=g4virus. The availability of these data will greatly expedite research on G-quadruplex in viruses, with the possibility to accelerate finding therapeutic opportunities to numerous and some fearsome human diseases.">

Their presence has been demonstrated also in several viral pathogens, providing new insights into viruses' biology and potentially serving as drug targets. Although experimental validation is needed to confirm the actual folding of G-quadruplexes, they can be inferred in silico directly from the nucleotide sequence. Several computational methods exist for this purpose, but they are all limited to the analysis of independent sequences. Since viral genomes can be highly variable, G-quadruplexes with important functional roles are expected to be PLOS Computational Biology | https://doi.">
