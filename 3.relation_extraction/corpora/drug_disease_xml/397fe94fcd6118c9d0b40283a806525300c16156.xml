  <chunk id="397fe94fcd6118c9d0b40283a806525300c16156.c2" text="The purpose of this case study is to show that outputs from situational and intervention analyses, when combined using a statistical decision model (specifically a Bayesian decision network), can provide recommendations on response options (including uncertainty). For the intervention analysis, we used our previously published intervention model of targeted antiviral distribution strategies [1]. This model and its findings form the basis for Australia's current response plan [2] . The model allows for: the use of antivirals for treatment of cases and postexposure prophylaxis of contacts; differential risks of severe disease outcomes and differential benefits of treatment across population subgroups; and health system capacity constraints. The most recent version of this model is described by Moss and colleagues [1] and it builds on a larger body of work, conducted over a 15-year period, which has focused on developing pandemic antiviral policy for the Australian context [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] .">

Decision model outcomes were compared for two hypothetical pandemics with distinct pandemic characteristics: one of severe impact (Pandemic A) and another of milder impact (Pandemic B) (see Section 2). The decision options for Pandemics A and B, given the evidence, were assessed using a Bayesian decision network.">
