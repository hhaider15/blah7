  <chunk id="a9075cf8e6853657941c799058d329b3e386fecd.c1" text="Infectious disease metagenomics is driven by the question: &quot;what is causing the disease?&quot; in contrast to classical metagenome studies which are guided by &quot;what is out there?&quot; In case of a novel virus, a first step to eventually establishing etiology can be to recover a full-length viral genome from a metagenomic sample. However, retrieval of a full-length genome of a divergent virus is technically challenging and can be time-consuming and costly. Here we discuss different assembly and fragment linkage strategies such as iterative assembly, motif searches, k-mer frequency profiling, coverage profile binning, and other strategies used to recover genomes of potential viral pathogens in a timely and cost-effective manner.">
