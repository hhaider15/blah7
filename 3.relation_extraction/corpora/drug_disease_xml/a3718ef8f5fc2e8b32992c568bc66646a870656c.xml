Human caliciviruses (HuCV) including norovirus (NoV, genogroup GI and GII) and sapovirus (SaV), is a leading cause of acute sporadic diarrhea in individuals across all age groups. However, few studies had been conducted clarifying the characteristics of HuCV in diarrhea cases across all age groups in China. Stool specimens were collected from 1,121 diarrhea cases and 319 healthy controls in outpatient departments. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to detect NoV (GI, GII) and SaV. Sequencing was applied to confirm the three viral infections and phylogenetic analysis was performed to determine their genotypes. A structured questionnaire was used to record the demographic information and clinical symptoms of subjects.">

The prevalence of the NoV genogroup GII and genotype GII.4 in diarrhea cases was significantly higher than that found in healthy controls (p &lt; 0.0001, p = 0.018, respectively). NoV GII (n = 118, 10.5 %) was the most common HuCV subtype in diarrhea cases, followed by SaV (n = 3, 0.3 %) and NoV GI (n = 2, 0.2 %). Of 118 NoV GII strains isolated from diarrhea patients. GII.4 (n = 55, 46.6 %) was the predominant strain, followed by GII.3 (n = 28, 23.7 %), GII.12 (n = 25, 21.2 %), GII.17 (n = 8, 6.8 %), and GII.5 (n = 2, 1.7 %). Of the 55 GII.4 strains, the GII.4 Sydney 2012 variant had absolutely predominant prevalence (n = 52, 94.5 %), followed by the NoV GII.4-2006b variant (n = 3, 5.5 %). The GII.4 Orleans 2009 variant was not found in diarrhea cases of the study.">

The GII.17 is an emergent variant in sporadic diarrhea and might become the predominant strain in diarrhea cases in the near future. Rapid, accurate detection kits need to be developed to help us find and treat NoV-associated diarrhea in clinical settings in a timely manner.">
