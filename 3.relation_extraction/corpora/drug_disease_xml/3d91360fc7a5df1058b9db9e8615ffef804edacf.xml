  <chunk id="3d91360fc7a5df1058b9db9e8615ffef804edacf.c1" text="Background: Though often used to control outbreaks, the efficacy of ward closure is unclear. This systematic review sought to identify studies defining and describing ward closure in outbreak control and to determine impact of ward closure as an intervention on outbreak containment."/>
  <chunk id="3d91360fc7a5df1058b9db9e8615ffef804edacf.c2" text="We searched these databases with no language restrictions: MEDLINE, . We also searched the following: IndMED; LILACS; reference lists from retrieved articles; conference proceedings; and websites of the CDCP, the ICID, and the WHO. We included studies of patients hospitalized in acute care facilities; used ward closure as a control measure; used other control measures; and discussed control of the outbreak(s) under investigation. A component approach was used to assess study quality."/>
