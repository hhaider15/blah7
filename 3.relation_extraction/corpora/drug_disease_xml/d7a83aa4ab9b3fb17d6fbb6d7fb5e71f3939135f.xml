  <chunk id="d7a83aa4ab9b3fb17d6fbb6d7fb5e71f3939135f.c1" text="Coronaviruses, yet they rarely display clinical symptoms of infection. Bat epithelial or fibroblast cell lines were previously established to study the bat immune response against viral infection. However, the lack of professional immune cells such as dendritic cells (DC) and macrophages has greatly limited the significance of current investigations. Using Pteropus alecto (P. alecto) GM-CSF plus IL4, FLT3L and CSF-1, we successfully generated bat bone marrow-derived DC and macrophages. Cells with the phenotype, morphology and functional features of monocyte-derived DC, bona fide DC or macrophages were obtained in GM-CSF/IL4, FLT3L or CSF-1 cultures, respectively. The successful generation of the first bat bone marrow-derived immune cells paves the way to unlocking the immune mechanisms that confer host resilience to pathogens in bats."/>

Interestingly, bats carrying these viruses, which are pathogenic in humans and other mammals, show no clinical signs of diseases under natural or experimental infection conditions 3,6-9 . This unique ability may reflect an unknown interaction between these bat viruses and the bat immune system as a result of extensive co-evolution over a long period of time 10 ."/>

To this end, various non-immune bat cell lines, originating from either insectivorous or fruit-bats and covering multiple species, had been constructed including Pteropus, Eidolon, Hypsignathus, Rousettus, Epomops, Myotis and Tadarida bats 11-14 . These cell lines, either primary or immortalized, supported bat viral infection studies and basic host responses. In contrast to the rapid clearance or reduction of bat viruses evident in in vivo experiments, viral replication does not appear to be significantly different to other hosts. However, when comparing the multiple in vitro studies in these bat cell lines 14-16 , bat viruses exhibited subversion of the bat immune system 11,16 . These observations prompted us to ask whether these bat cells serve as an appropriate model for studying the bat immune response.">
