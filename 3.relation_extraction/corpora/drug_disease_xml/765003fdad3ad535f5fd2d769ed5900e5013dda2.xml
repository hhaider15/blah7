  <chunk id="765003fdad3ad535f5fd2d769ed5900e5013dda2.c1" text="Here we present an approach that advances the throughput of a genetic analysis of a positive-sense RNA virus by simplifying virus construction. It enabled comprehensive dissection of a complex, multigene phenotype through rapid derivation of a large number of chimeric viruses and construction of a mutant library directly from a virus pool. The versatility of the approach described here expands the applicability of diverse genetic approaches to study these viruses.">
