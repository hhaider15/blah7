Two NmAbs, P4B-1, and E10E-1-10 that recognized the ectodomain of the full-length recombinant PEDV S protein and exhibited neutralizing ability against the PEDV-PT virus were selected. Recombinant truncated S proteins were used to identify the target sequences for the NmAbs and P4B-1 was shown to recognize the C-terminus of CO-26K equivalent epitope (COE) at amino acids (a.a.) 575-639 of the PEDV S. Interestingly, E10E-1-10 could recognize a novel neutralizing epitope at a.a. 435-485 within the S1 A domain of the PEDV S protein, whose importance and function are yet to be determined. Moreover, both NmAbs could not bind to linearized S proteins, indicating that only conformational epitopes are recognized. This data could improve our understanding of the antigenic structures of the PEDV S protein and facilitate future development of novel epitope-based vaccines.">

Recently, five core cell attachment domains of the PEDV S1 protein, S1 0 , S1 A , S1 B , S1 C , and S1 D , were proposed based on the three-dimensional structures cryo-EM of Alphacoronaviruses 16,17 . The proposed S1 0 domain has a sialic acid binding domain 10 . The S1 B domain is a common location for receptor binding in coronaviruses and can be a potential neutralizing target for the new PEDV variant capable of eliciting the production of cross-neutralizing antibodies against different PEDV strains 17 . Furthermore, several linear B-cell epitopes of PEDV overlapping with S1D have been shown to neutralize both the historic strain as well as the new variant PEDV strains 18 . Till date, no neutralizing epitope has been identified in the S1 A domain of the historic or the new PEDV variant strains.">
