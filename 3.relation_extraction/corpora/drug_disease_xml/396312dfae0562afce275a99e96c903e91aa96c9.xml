Previous studies suggested a close association between the interferon-induced transmembrane protein-3 (IFITM3) genetic variant rs12252 and influenza. Here, we explored the correlation between the rs12252 and influenza susceptibility and severity using meta-analysis.">

Generally, there is increased risk of influenza in subjects carrying rs12252 in the recessive model (CC vs. CT+TT: OR = 2.35, 95% CI: 1.49-3.70, P&lt;0.001), the dominant model (CC+CT vs. TT: OR=1.60, 95% CI: 1.18-2.22, P=0.003), the homozygote comparison (CC vs. TT: OR=4.11, 95% CI: 2.15-7.84, P&lt;0.001), and the allele contrast (C vs. T: OR=1.67, 95% CI: 1.32-2.13, P&lt;0.001). Stratification analysis of ethnicity and severity revealed a significant increase in influenza susceptibility by IFITM3-SNP rs12252among both Asian and Caucasian population. SNP rs12252 shows significant impact on severe infections (P&lt;0.05), but not on mild influenza. Besides, our result also associated rs12252 with influenza severity (severe vs. mild: OR=2.37, 95% CI: 1.32-4.25, P=0.004), (severe vs. control: OR=2.70, 95%">
