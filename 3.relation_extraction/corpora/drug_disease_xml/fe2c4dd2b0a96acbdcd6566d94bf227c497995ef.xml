  <chunk id="fe2c4dd2b0a96acbdcd6566d94bf227c497995ef.c2" text="Data were retrieved from arrivals' health declaration forms and questionnaires for febrile arrivals at an international airport collected by a national quarantine station during the year 2012. Self-reported health declaration forms were returned by 355,887 arrivals (61% of the total arrivals). Of these, 608 symptomatic arrivals (0.2%) including 6 febrile arrivals were analyzed."/>
  <chunk id="fe2c4dd2b0a96acbdcd6566d94bf227c497995ef.c3" text=": Fever prevalence at an international airport in Korea was 0.002%. Self-reported fever was significantly positively associated with tympanic temperature (p&lt; 0.001). The difference between the thermal camera temperature (36.83°C) and tympanic (or ear) temperature (38.14°C) was not statistically significant."/>
  <chunk id="fe2c4dd2b0a96acbdcd6566d94bf227c497995ef.c4" text="The findings imply that a procedure for mass detection of fever such as self-reported questionnaires and thermal camera scanning may serve as an effective tool for detecting febrile arrivals at quarantine stations. Future research can benefit from looking at the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the entry screening system."/>
