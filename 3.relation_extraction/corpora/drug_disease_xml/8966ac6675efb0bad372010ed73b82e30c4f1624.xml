Mainstream diagnostic assays are challenged by their intrinsic diversity, leading to false negatives and incomplete characterisation. New sequencing techniques are expanding our ability to agnostically interrogate nucleic acids within diverse sample types, but in the clinical setting are limited by overwhelming host material and ultra-low target frequency. Through selective host RNA depletion and compensatory protocol adjustments for ultra-low RNA inputs, we are able to detect three major blood-borne RNA viruses -HIV, HCV and HEV. We recovered complete genomes and up to 43% of the genome from samples with viral loads of 10 4 and 10 3 IU/ml respectively. Additionally, we demonstrated the utility of this method in detecting and characterising members of diverse RNA virus families within a human plasma background, some present at very low levels. By applying this method to a patient sample series, we have simultaneously determined the full genome of both a novel subtype of HCV genotype 6, and a co-infecting human pegivirus. This method builds upon earlier RNA metagenomic techniques and can play an important role in the surveillance and diagnostics of blood-borne viruses.">

'VIDISCA' is one such approach, where viral nucleic acids are preferentially amplified through the use of non-random hexamers that do not complement human rRNA sequences. In combination with NGS, partial genomes of novel viruses have been detected by this method 28, 29 . As with non-depleting methods, extensive further work is needed to fully characterise detected viruses, and when applied to diagnostic virology, the read depths and genome coverages remain low even at high viral loads 30-33 . Most groups selectively deplete rRNA by hybridising rRNA-specific DNA 'scissor probes' to the extracted nucleic acids, and digesting the rRNA/DNA duplexes with RNAse H 34, 35 .
