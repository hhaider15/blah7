  <chunk id="085522850a68603e453f67deacac2be1293a483f.c1" text="In recent years, an increasing number of outbreaks of Dengue, Chikungunya and Zika viruses have been reported in Asia and the Americas. Monitoring virus genotype diversity is crucial to understand the emergence and spread of outbreaks, both aspects that are vital to develop effective prevention and treatment strategies. Hence, we developed an efficient method to classify virus sequences with respect to their species and sub-species (i.e. serotype and/or genotype). This tool provides an easy-to-use software implementation of this new method and was validated on a large dataset assessing the classification performance with respect to whole-genome sequences and partial-genome sequences.

In addition to the epidemic caused by DENV, which has been described in many tropical countries, the introduction of CHIKV and ZIKV in these countries is a major public health concern. These arboviruses are primarily transmitted by mosquitoes of the species Ae. Aegypti and its related diseases result in increased financial costs associated with PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | https://doi.diagnosis and treatment. To support the design of efficient diagnosis, prevention and treatment strategies, a bioinformatics tool has been developed for the genotyping of these viruses based on appropriate evolutionary models in an automatic, accurate and rapid manner. A set of virus reference sequences was obtained from GenBank and used for the development of the tools. This process involved the alignment of the reference sequences followed by phylogenetic tree reconstructions. To assign the genotypes uploaded by the user, the tool analyses the sequences one by one, genotypes through identification, alignment and phylogenetic reconstruction. This computational method allows the high-throughput classification of these virus species and genotypes in seconds. As shown experimentally, genotypes are classified most confidently using the envelope gene or complete genome sequences.">
