To verify the precise route of infection for the case, we conducted an in-depth epidemiological investigation in cooperation with the KCDC.">

During the CPR which lasted for an hour, a large amount of body fluid was splashed. The nurse was presumed to have touched the mask to adjust its position during the CPR. She suggested that she was contaminated with the MERS patient's body fluids by wiping away the sweat from her face during the CPR.">

The MERS guidelines should reflect this case to decrease the risk of infection during CPR.">
