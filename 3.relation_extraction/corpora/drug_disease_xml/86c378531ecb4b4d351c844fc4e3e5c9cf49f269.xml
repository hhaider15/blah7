  <chunk id="86c378531ecb4b4d351c844fc4e3e5c9cf49f269.c2" text="Methods Recruits in four successive Royal Thai Army basic training classes living in military barracks were monitored for the symptoms of influenza-like illness (ILI) or upper respiratory illness (URI). Classes 1 and 2 were also monitored after basic training. Nasal/throat swabs from acute illnesses were collected and tested by influenza RT-PCR (all four classes). In addition, class 1 had multiplex PCR performed along with the analysis of bed locations within the barracks.">

  <chunk id="86c378531ecb4b4d351c844fc4e3e5c9cf49f269.c3" text="Results Influenza-like illness/upper respiratory illness rates ranged from 4Á7 to 6Á9 per 100 recruit-weeks in the four classes and generally decreased during the course of basic training (P &lt; 0Á05 in three of four classes). Rates during basic training were 1Á7 (95% CI: 1Á29, 2Á29) and 2Á5 (95% CI: 1Á5, 4Á1) times higher than after basic training (classes 1 and 2, respectively). In class 1, coronavirus, parainfluenza virus, and rhinovirus were the most commonly identified respiratory pathogens; only one influenza PCR-positive infection was detected in all four classes. Bed locations of URI/ILI cases in class 1 tended to be in closer proximity to each other.">

Our findings may contribute to control measures in similar confined settings both within and outside the military."/>
