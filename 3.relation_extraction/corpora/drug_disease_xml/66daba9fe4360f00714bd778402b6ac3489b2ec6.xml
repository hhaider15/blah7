  <chunk id="66daba9fe4360f00714bd778402b6ac3489b2ec6.c1" text="Guanine-rich sequences can fold into four-stranded structures of stacked guanine-tetrads, so-called G-quadruplexes (G4). These unique motifs have been extensively studied on the DNA level; however, exploration of the biological roles of G4s at the RNA level is just emerging. Here we show that G4 RNA when introduced within coding regions are capable of stimulating À1 ribosomal frameshifting (À1 FS) in vitro and in cultured cells. Systematic manipulation of the loop length between each G-tract revealed that the À1 FS efficiency positively correlates with G4 stability. Addition of a G4-stabilizing ligand, PhenDC3, resulted in higher À1 FS. Further, we demonstrated that the G4s can stimulate +1 FS and stop codon readthrough as well. These results suggest a potentially novel translational gene regulation mechanism mediated by G4 RNA.">
