Dual and multiple infectious agents were detected in 31.4% and 18.6% of the samples, respectively. Viral infection was predominant in the pediatric environment (90.8%, P &lt; 0.001), male patients (88.0%), and spring (93.8%). Rhinovirus was the most detected virus (51.8%) followed by respiratory syncytial virus A/B (34.4%), coronavirus group (18.5%), adenovirus (17.9%), and parainfluenza viruses 1-4 (10.9%). Respiratory Syncytial virus A/B was significantly associated with gender (38.0% male cases vs 28.3% female cases, P = 0.02). Infections by Adenovirus, Bocavirus, and Metapneumovirus A/B increased with increasing age of patients (predominated cases aged 6-12 months, P &lt; 0.001). S. pneumoniae was detected in 30.9% of th tested samples. In 18.2% of the negative viral infections, only S. pneumoniae was identified.">

The observed different pathogenic profiles across age groups could be helpful to avoid the misclassification of patients presenting with ARIs at the triage level when no standardized protocol is available. This study will provide clues for physicians informing decisions regarding preventive strategies and medication in Tunisia."/>
