  <chunk id="0f6b1645fdc27b32ae9fdb4f99dbbb30eb1dfd7f.c1" text="Background: Dengue virus is endemic in peninsular Malaysia. The clinical manifestations vary depending on the incubation period of the virus as well as the immunity of the patients. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is prevalent in Malaysia where the incidence is 3.2%. It has been noted that some G6PD-deficient individuals suffer from more severe clinical presentation of dengue infection. In this study, we aim to investigate the oxidative responses of DENV2infected monocytes from G6PD-deficient individuals."/>

In an effort to explain the reason for this enhanced susceptibility, we investigated the production of NO and O 2 2 in the monocytes of individuals with G6PD deficiency compared with normal controls. We found that levels of NO and O 2 2 were significantly lower in the DENV-infected monocytes from G6PD-deficient individuals compared with normal controls. Furthermore, the overall oxidative stress in DENV-infected monocytes from G6PD-deficient individuals was significantly higher when compared to normal controls. Correlation studies between DENV-infected cells and oxidative state of monocytes further confirmed these findings."/>
