  <chunk id="0f8451b64b7aa2e642036d79efc1969125c45873.c1" text="Background: A previous meta-analysis reported a positive association between an insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism in the angiotensin-converting enzyme gene (ACE) and the risk of acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Here, we updated this meta-analysis and additionally assessed the association of this polymorphism with ALI/ARDS mortality. Methods: We searched electronic databases through October 2011 for the terms &quot;angiotensin-converting enzyme gene&quot;, &quot;acute lung injury&quot;, and &quot;acute respiratory distress syndrome,&quot; and reviewed all studies that reported the relationship of the I/D polymorphism in ACE with ALI/ARDS in humans. Seven studies met the inclusion criteria, comprising 532 ALI/ ARDS patients, 3032 healthy controls, and 1432 patients without ALI/ARDS. We used three genetic models: the allele, dominant, and recessive models.">

However, the ACE I/D polymorphism was associated with the mortality risk of ALI/ARDS in Asian subjects (P allele &lt; 0.0001, P dominant = 0.001, P recessive = 0.002).
