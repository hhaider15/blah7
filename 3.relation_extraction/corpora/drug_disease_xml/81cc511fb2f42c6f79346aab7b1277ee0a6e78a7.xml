  <chunk id="81cc511fb2f42c6f79346aab7b1277ee0a6e78a7.c1" text="Bartonella infections were investigated in seven species of bats from four regions of the Republic of Georgia. Of the 236 bats that were captured, 212 (90%) specimens were tested for Bartonella infection. Colonies identified as Bartonella were isolated from 105 (49.5%) of 212 bats Phylogenetic analysis based on sequence variation of the gltA gene differentiated 22 unique Bartonella genogroups. Genetic distances between these diverse genogroups were at the level of those observed between different Bartonella species described previously. Twenty-one reference strains from 19 representative genogroups were characterized using four additional genetic markers. Host specificity to bat genera or families was reported for several Bartonella genogroups. Some Bartonella genotypes found in bats clustered with those identified in dogs from Thailand and humans from Poland."/>

A human disease case in the USA was associated with a novel Bartonella species, which later was identified in bats in Finland. This human case has demonstrated the zoonotic potential of bat-borne Bartonella and underscores the need for extended surveillance and studies of these pathogens. The present work assesses prevalence and diversity of Bartonella in bats in the country of Georgia (southern Caucasus), characterizes reference strains representing diverse genogroups by variation of genetic loci, and evaluates the links between identified Bartonella genogroups and bat hosts. Importantly, some Bartonella genotypes found in bats were close or identical to those identified in dogs and humans. The data indicate that the public health impact of Bartonella carried by bats should be investigated.">
