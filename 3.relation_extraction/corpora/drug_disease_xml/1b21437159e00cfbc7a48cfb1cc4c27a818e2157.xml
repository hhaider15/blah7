In its simplest form R 0 can be understood as the product of the infectious period, the number of infectious contacts and the per-contact transmission probability, which in the case of vectortransmitted diseases necessarily extend to the vector stages. As vectors do not usually recover from infection, they remain infectious for life, which places high significance on the vector's life expectancy. Current methods for estimating the R 0 for a vector-borne disease are mostly derived from compartmental modelling frameworks assuming constant vector mortality rates. We hypothesised that some of the assumptions underlying these models can lead to unrealistic high vector life expectancies with important repercussions for R 0 estimates.">

Control effort required to curb their continued spread or even prevent their establishment in the first place are partially determined by the disease's basic reproduction number, R 0 . Of particular importance for estimating R 0 is the duration at which the vector can transmit the disease, which is limited by its life expectancy. Many R 0 estimation methods are based on mathematical frameworks that assume constant vector mortality rates. Here we demonstrate how the resulting exponential distribution in life-expectancy can lead to significant over-estimations. By means of an individual-based model we elucidate the effect of vector mortality on R 0 estimates and derive a correction factor that alleviates some of the discrepancies due to erroneous vector age distributions. Our results clearly demonstrate the need to obtain more realistic, i.e. field-relevant vector mortality rates in order to generate robust estimates of a disease's reproduction number and provide guidance for setting-specific disease control.">
