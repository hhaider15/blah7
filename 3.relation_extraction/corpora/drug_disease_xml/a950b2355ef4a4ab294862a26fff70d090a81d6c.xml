  <chunk id="a950b2355ef4a4ab294862a26fff70d090a81d6c.c1" text="Motivation: Understanding the relationship between the sequence, structure, binding energy, binding kinetics and binding thermodynamics of protein-protein interactions is crucial to understanding cellular signaling, the assembly and regulation of molecular complexes, the mechanisms through which mutations lead to disease, and protein engineering. Results: We present SKEMPI 2.0, a major update to our database of binding free energy changes upon mutation for structurally resolved protein-protein interactions. This version now contains manually curated binding data for 7085 mutations, an increase of 133%, including changes in kinetics for 1844 mutations, enthalpy and entropy changes for 443 mutations, and 440 mutations, which abolish detectable binding.">
