  <chunk id="05ba033423b8fcd8ca26cf0cf1611e128048f9db.c1" text="Retroviruses include infectious agents inducing severe diseases in humans and animals. In addition, retroviruses are widely used as tools to transfer genes of interest to target cells. Understanding the entry mechanism of retroviruses contributes to developments of novel therapeutic approaches against retrovirus-induced diseases and efficient exploitation of retroviral vectors. Entry of enveloped viruses into host cell cytoplasm is achieved by fusion between the viral envelope and host cell membranes at either the cell surface or intracellular vesicles. Many animal retroviruses enter host cells through endosomes and require endosome acidification. Ecotropic murine leukemia virus entry requires cathepsin proteases activated by the endosome acidification. CD4dependent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is thought to occur via endosomes, but endosome acidification is not necessary for the entry whereas entry of CD4-independent HIVs, which are thought to be prototypes of CD4-dependent viruses, is low pH dependent. There are several controversial results on the retroviral entry pathways. Because endocytosis and endosome acidification are complicatedly controlled by cellular mechanisms, the retrovirus entry pathways may be different in different cell lines.">

  <chunk id="05ba033423b8fcd8ca26cf0cf1611e128048f9db.c3" text="Mechanism of membrane fusion by the retroviral TM proteins is described elsewhere in details [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] and is similar to those used by envelope proteins of other enveloped viruses [8, 9] . Briefly, the retroviral entry mechanism is proposed as follows. The TM protein is thought to have hairpin-like structure (Figure 1 ). The binding of SU with its cognate cell surface receptor induces conformational changes of the TM subunit. The N-terminal hydrophobic domain of the TM subunit called fusion peptide is exposed by the conformational change and inserted into host cell membrane. The TM protein then coverts to a trimer-ofhairpins conformation, and viral envelope and host cell membranes approach and mix. Finally, the fusion pore is formed and expanded to derive the viral core into host cell cytoplasm. This conformational change pathway of the TM protein induces the membrane fusion for the retroviral entry into host cells.">
