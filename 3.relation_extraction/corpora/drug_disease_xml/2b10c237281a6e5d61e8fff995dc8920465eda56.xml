  <chunk id="2b10c237281a6e5d61e8fff995dc8920465eda56.c1" text="Background: Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are classified into high-risk HPV and low-risk HPV. The most common high-risk HPV types in cervical cancer are HPV 16 and 18, and the most common low-risk types causing genital warts are HPV 6 and HPV 11. In this study, applying novel AllGlo fluorescent probes, we established a quadruplex quantitative PCR method to simultaneously detect and differentiate HPV 6, 11, 16 and 18 in a single tube.">

Finally, clinical samples that had been tested previously by TaqMan PCR and HPV GenoArray (GA) test were used to verify the accuracy and sensitivity of the method."/>
  <chunk id="2b10c237281a6e5d61e8fff995dc8920465eda56.c3" text="The assay has a sensitivity of 10 1 to 10 2 copies/test and a linear detection range from 10 1 to 10 8 copies/test. The mean amplification efficiencies for HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18 were 0.97, 1.10, 0.93 and 1.20, respectively, and the mean correlation coefficient (r 2 ) of each standard curve was above 0.99 for plasmid templates ranging from 10 3 to 10 7 copies/test. There was 100% agreement between the AllGlo quadruplex quantitative PCR, HPV GA test and TaqMan uniplex qPCR methods."/>
  <chunk id="2b10c237281a6e5d61e8fff995dc8920465eda56.c4" text="Conclusions: AllGlo quadruplex quantitative PCR in a single tube has the advantages of relatively high throughput, good reproducibility, high sensitivity, high specificity, and a wide linear range of detection. The convenient single tube format makes this assay a powerful tool for the studies of mixed infections by multiple pathogens, viral typing and viral load quantification."/>
