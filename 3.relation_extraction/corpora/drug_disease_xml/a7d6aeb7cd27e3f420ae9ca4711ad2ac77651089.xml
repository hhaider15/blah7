  <chunk id="a7d6aeb7cd27e3f420ae9ca4711ad2ac77651089.c1" text="Lung transplant patients are a vulnerable group of immunosuppressed patients that are prone to frequent respiratory infections. We studied 60 episodes of respiratory symptoms in 71 lung transplant patients. Almost half of these episodes were of unknown infectious etiology despite extensive routine diagnostic testing."/>

Respiratory samples were enriched for viruses by filtration and nuclease digestion, whole nucleic acids extracted and randomly amplified before high throughput metagenomic virus sequencing. Viruses were identified by a bioinformatic pipeline and confirmed and quantified using specific real-time PCR.">
