  <chunk id="d4f6cfb312bae60aa35168d4a775bdb90c4bc39c.c1" text="Background Respiratory viral infections (RVIs) are the most common causes of respiratory infections. The prevalence of respiratory viruses in adults is underestimated. Meteorological variations and air pollution are likely to play a role in these infections.">

  <chunk id="d4f6cfb312bae60aa35168d4a775bdb90c4bc39c.c3" text="Methods Eleven thousand nine hundred and fifty-three hospitalizations (adults and children) for respiratory symptoms were correlated with meteorological parameters and air pollutants. In a subset of adults, nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected and analyzed through IFI test. The data were analyzed using time-series analysis."/>
  <chunk id="d4f6cfb312bae60aa35168d4a775bdb90c4bc39c.c4" text="Results Influenza-like illness and SARI were diagnosed in 3698 (30Á9%) and 2063 (17Á7%) patients, respectively. Thirty-seven (9Á0%) samples were positive by IFI and 93 of 410 (22Á7%) were IFI and/or PCR positive. In a multivariate logistic regression model, IFI positivity was statistically associated with absolute humidity, use of air conditioning, and presence of mold in home. Sunshine duration was significantly associated with the frequency of ILI cases. For SARI cases, the variables mean temperature, sunshine duration, relative humidity, and mean concentration of pollutants were singnificant.">

  <chunk id="d4f6cfb312bae60aa35168d4a775bdb90c4bc39c.c5" text="Conclusions At least 22% of infections in adult patients admitted to ER with respiratory complaints were caused by RVI. The correlations among meteorological variables, air pollution, ILI/SARI cases, and respiratory viruses demonstrated the relevance of climate factors as significant underlying contributors to the prevalence of RVI."/>
