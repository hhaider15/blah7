  <chunk id="0326bf875d2a22d7c4a4328dcd34c2d801fd110e.c1" text="Background: Years of advocacy for the neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) have focused the world's attention on these diseases of the poor, resulting most recently in the 2012 ''London Declaration'' and the recent World Health Assembly Resolution WHA66.12 on NTDs in May 2013.
