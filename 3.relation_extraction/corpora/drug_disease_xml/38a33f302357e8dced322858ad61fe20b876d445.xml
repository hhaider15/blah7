Ebola-related stigma was measured by adapting the validated HIV related stigma for people living with HIV/AIDS instrument. We also measured traditional and complementary medicine (T&amp;CM) use (as a measure of informal healthcare use). Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and regression analysis. Results: EVD survivors report higher levels of internalised stigma (0.92 ± 0.77) compared to total enacted stigma (0.71 ± 0.61). Social isolation (0.96 ± 0.88) was the highest reported enacted stigma subscale. Ebola survivors who identified as Christians [AOR = 2.51, 95%CI: 1.15-5.49, p = 0.021], who perceived their health to be fair/poor [AOR = 2.58, 95%CI: 1.39-4.77. p = 0.003] and who reside in the northern region of Sierra Leone [AOR = 2.80, 95%CI: 1.29-6.07, p = 0.009] were more likely to experience internalised stigma. Verbal abuse [AOR = 1.95, 95%CI: 1.09-3.49, p = 0.025] and healthcare neglect [AOR = 2.35, 95%CI: 1.37-4.02, p = 0.002] were independent predictors of T&amp;CM use among EVD survivors.">

Religiosity, perceived health status and region were identified as independent predictors of internalised stigma. Verbal abuse and healthcare neglect predict informal healthcare use. EVD survivorcentred and community-driven anti-stigma programs are needed to promote EVD survivors' recovery and community re-integration."/>
