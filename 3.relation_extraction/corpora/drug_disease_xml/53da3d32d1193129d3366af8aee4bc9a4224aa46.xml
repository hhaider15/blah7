  <chunk id="53da3d32d1193129d3366af8aee4bc9a4224aa46.c1" text="In this study by McCarthy et al., the authors follow up on a published observation that infection with a pathogenic strain of CHIKV leads to an overall disorganization of the dLN including the failure of lymphocytes to accumulate and GCs to develop. Here, the authors perform a detailed, mechanistic analysis of what leads to this phenotype and show nicely that in mice infected with a &quot;pathogenic&quot; strain AF15561 there are increases in monocytes and neutrophils in the dLN early in infection and depletion of these cells leads to an accumulation of lymphocytes and restoration of the dLN organization after CHIKV infection. They go on to show that depletion of Gr-1 positive cells also increases CHIKV specific B-cell responses. To continue their mechanistic studies, they perform a beautiful set of genetic experiments to show that the monocyte recruitment is dependent on MyD88, Nos2 and Nox2 are involved in the disruption of the dLN during CHIKV infection, and iNos expression is controlled by an IFNAR and IRF5 dependent pathway. Finally, they show that there are distinct pathways activation ISGs in the footpad (IRF3/IRF7 dependent) and the dLN (IRF5 dependent). Overall, this study was well-written, easy to follow, and is novel, contributing to multiple areas of CHIKV infection. However, I had a few concerns that will should be addressed."/>
