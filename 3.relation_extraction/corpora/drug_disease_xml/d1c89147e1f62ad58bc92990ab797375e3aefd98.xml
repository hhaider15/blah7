Vδ2 T cells presented a terminally differentiated profile, expressed granzyme B and maintained their ability to produce IFN-γ. These findings provide new knowledge on the immune response profile during self-limited infection that may help in vaccine efficacy definition, and in identifying possible immuno-pathogenetic mechanisms of severe infection."/>
  <chunk id="d1c89147e1f62ad58bc92990ab797375e3aefd98.c2" text="Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging arbovirus of the Flaviviridae family isolated in Uganda in 1947 1 and usually causes a mild and self-limiting infection. Nevertheless, several data strongly indicate a high rate of primary microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndrome during ZIKV infection in French Polynesia and Brazil 2-5 . There are currently no licensed medical interventions (drugs, other therapeutics or vaccines) available to treat or prevent ZIKV infection and the development of severe disease. The wide cross reactivity among different flavivirus 6 and the risk associated with the antibody dependent enhancement 7 strongly request the identification of protective and pathogenetic immune signature to ZIKV.">

During the acute and convalescent phases of ZIKV infection, increased levels of Th1, Th2, Th9, Th17 cytokines have been reported, suggesting that a polyfunctional T-cell response is required for recovery from ZIKV infection 10 . Nevertheless, an unbalanced immunoactivation with high levels of IL-6 and IL-8 in the cerebrospinal fluid has been associated to encephalomyelitis 11 . Although the main role played by humoral response 12 , an involvement of CD8 T cell response in the protection against ZIKV infection has been recently suggested in a mouse model of ZIKV infection 13 . Moreover, the activation of T-cells and their Th1 polarization has been also recently demonstrated in mice 14 . No data are available on the cellular-mediated immune response during the acute phase of ZIKV infection in humans.">
