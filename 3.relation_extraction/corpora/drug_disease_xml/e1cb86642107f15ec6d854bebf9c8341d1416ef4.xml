  <chunk id="e1cb86642107f15ec6d854bebf9c8341d1416ef4.c1" text="Here we present an amide-assistant mechanism that successfully reduces the prevalence of these problems for CHA and maximizes its thermo-and structure-buffering abilities. Such an organic amide-promoted CHA (shortened as OHT-CHA) can unprecedentedly amplify through 4 °C to 60 °C without rebuilding sequences or concerning target complexity. We are then for the first time able to employ it as a direct and universal signal booster for loop mediated isothermal reaction (LAMP). LAMP is one of the most promising point-of-care (POC) gene amplifiers, but has been hard to detect precisely due to structured products and haunted off-target amplicons. OHT-CHA guarantees a significant and reliable signal for LAMP reaction amplified from as little as 10 −19 M virus gene. And one single set of OHT-CHA is qualified to any detection requirement, either in real-time at LAMP running temperature (~60 °C), or at end-point on a POC photon counter only holding environmental temperatures fluctuating between 4 °C to 42 °C.">

One of these promising circuits, catalytic two hairpin assembly (known as CHA) 8,9 , uses a single stranded DNA oligonucleotide as an input/catalyst to initial two successive toehold-mediated stand exchange/displacement reactions that assemble two hairpin substrates into duplex products (Fig. 1A) . Under a regular reaction condition, an ideal CHA reaction is capable of amplifying 50 to 100 fold within a few hours (Fig. 1B, column 1) . Due to the high signal-to-background ratio and programmability, CHA has been widely applied into detecting various analytical platforms and considered as a new generation of signal amplifier and transducer. A wide range of targets have been designed as catalysts for detection, including oligonucleotides 10,11 , aptamer-intermediated non-nucleic acid species such as proteins and small molecules 12,13 , nucleic acid nanostructures 14 , and certain isothermal nucleic acid amplification products such as rolling circle amplification (RCA) and strand exchange amplification (SDA) 15, 16 .">

A well-designed circuit may only functions efficiently at a narrow temperature zone, for example, ranging from 32 °C to 42 °C for a regular reaction optimized to perform at 37 °C 15 . Once the temperature fluctuates out, it requires laboriously shortening or extending sequence lengths according to temperature cooling or elevating 15 . We recently also realized CHA may be still inefficient or non-functional even after rational design. The main reason is most worthy-to-detect RNA or">
