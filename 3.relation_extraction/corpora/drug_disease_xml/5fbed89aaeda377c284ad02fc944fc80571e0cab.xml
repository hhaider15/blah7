In presence of cells expressing HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins (Envs), these BiKEs activated specifically CD16Aexpressing Jurkat T cells, degranulated NK cells, induced cytokine production and killed Env-expressing cells. They also effectively mediated killing of chronically and acutely HIV-1 infected T cells by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The presumed ability of these CD4-based BiKEs to bind all HIV-1 isolates, their small size and fully human origin, combined with high efficacy suggest their potential for HIV-1 eradication.">

Therapeutics approved for clinical use have varying degrees of side effects and none can eradicate the HIV-1. Protein therapeutics are typically cell target-specific and relatively safe 1 . Currently, antibody therapeutics are dominant protein therapeutics with more than 50 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) approved for clinical use 2 . However, there are no mAbs approved for therapy against any viral diseases. The humanized mAb Synagis is the only one approved by the FDA against a viral disease, however, it is only for prevention and not for therapy 3 .">

Attempts to use bnAbs alone or in combination or as components of chimeric antigen receptors (CARs), bispecific T cell engagers (BiTEs) and other bispecific proteins resulted in promising results both in vitro and in vivo 4-8 . A major problem with all known bnAbs is that none of them neutralize all HIV-1 isolates which can result in generation of escape mutants.">

Recently, we engineered a soluble one domain CD4 (mD1.22) which can bind and neutralize all tested isolates as a component of a bispecific multivalent protein 9 . Thus, we have hypothesized that a bispecific fusion protein containing mD1.22 fused to an antibody arm that binds to CD16A on NK cells, not only would presumably neutralize all HIV-1 isolates but also could guide and activate natural killer (NK) cells to find and kill HIV-1 infected cells expressing its envelope glycoprotein (Env, gp120-gp41) at their surface.

Decreasing the size of the proteins can dramatically increase their effective diffusion coefficients, e.g., decreasing the size from 150 kDa to about 15 kDa can increase the diffusion through normal solid tissue about 100-fold 12 . Therefore, in an attempt to decrease the size of BiKEs we also used antibody domain binders to CD16A which we recently identified and described 13 . We have hypothesized that BiKEs generated by fusing the one domain CD4 through a flexible linker to an antibody domain binder to CD16A would have relatively small size which could allow them to effectively penetrate tissues and guide the NK cells to kill HIV-1 infected cells.">

Most (but not all, e.g., 14 ) previously reported antibodies (e.g., 15 ) are from animal origin. The animal antibodies can be humanized and some, e.g., from llama 16 , are similar in sequence to human antibodies; however, the probability for immunogenicity when administered in humans is still on average higher than that for fully human antibodies 17 .

Importantly, in the presence of cells expressing Env, these BiKEs activated specifically the CD16A-expressing Jurkat T cells as well as induced the degranulation of NK cells and resulted in killing of the Env-expressing cells. Furthermore, these BiKEs mediated effective killing of HIV-1 infected T cells by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). To our knowledge these are the first human domain-based BiKEs and the first against HIV-1 based on CD4; we found only one other report published as an extended abstract about BiKEs against HIV-1 based on an anti-CD16A llama domain and the VRC01 Fab 18 . The possibility that our CD4-based BiKEs can bind all HIV-1 isolates, their small size and fully human origin, combined with their high-affinity and specific, activating interactions with CD16A resulting in lysis of HIV-1 infected cells suggest that they are promising candidate therapeutics and worth of further evaluation in animal models and potentially in humans for therapy of HIV-1 infections with the final goal of its eradication.">
