We aimed to evaluate bacterial bronchial infection as a possible reason for non response to conventional asthma therapy, and to identify and characterise the predominant pathogens involved.">

Procedural measures were taken to limit contamination risk and quantitative bacterial culture of BAL fluid (significance cut-off â‰¥ 10 4 colony-forming units/ml) was used. Modern microbiological methods were used for detection of a wide panel of pathogens and for characterisation of the bacterial isolates.">

Significant bacterial BAL cultures were found in 48,5 % of patients. Haemophilus influenzae was isolated in 30,3 %, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 12,1 % and Moraxella catarrhalis in 12,1 %. All H. influenzae isolates were non-encapsulated strains and definitely distinguished from non-haemolytic H. haemolyticus. Respiratory viruses were detected in 21,9 % of cases with mixed bacterial-viral infection in 12,1 %. Cytology revealed a marked neutrophilic inflammation.">

Non-typeable H. influenzae seems to be the predominant pathogen involved, followed by S. pneumoniae and M. catarrhalis."/>
