  <chunk id="d3618a7956fc136c7183df5b9c665e96a3df8748.c1" text="Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) was first identified in Hong Kong in 2012 from samples taken from pigs in 2009. PDCoV was subsequently identified in the USA in 2014 in pigs with a history of severe diarrhea. The virus has now been detected in pigs in several countries around the world. Following the development of tissue culture adapted strains of PDCoV, it is now possible to address questions regarding virus-host cell interactions for this genera of coronavirus. Here, we presented a detailed study of PDCoV-induced replication organelles. All positive-strand RNA viruses induce the rearrangement of cellular membranes during virus replication to support viral RNA synthesis, forming the replication organelle. Replication organelles for the Alpha-, Beta-, and Gammacoronavirus genera have been characterized. All coronavirus genera induced the formation of double-membrane vesicles (DMVs). In addition, Alphaand Betacoronaviruses induce the formation of convoluted membranes, while Gammacoronaviruses induce the formation of zippered endoplasmic reticulum (ER) with tethered double-membrane spherules. However, the structures induced by Deltacoronaviruses, particularly the presence of convoluted membranes or double-membrane spherules, are unknown. Initially, the dynamics of PDCoV strain OH-FD22 replication were assessed with the onset of viral RNA synthesis, protein synthesis, and progeny particle release determined. Subsequently, virus-induced membrane rearrangements were identified in infected cells by electron microscopy. As has been observed for all other coronaviruses studied to date, PDCoV replication was found to induce the formation of double-membrane vesicles. Significantly, however, PDCoV replication was also found to induce the formation of regions of zippered endoplasmic reticulum, small associated tethered vesicles, and double-membrane spherules. These structures strongly resemble the replication organelle induced by avian Gammacoronavirus infectious bronchitis virus.">

The membrane origin, shape, and structure of ROs varies between different virus families, but there are common themes in the types of structure produced. Several viruses, including enteroviruses, arteriviruses, toroviruses, hepatitis C virus, and foot and mouth disease virus, induce the formation of double-membrane vesicles (DMVs), often along with single-membrane vesicles and tubules or paired membranes [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . The second type of structure which are commonly induced are spherules or invaginated vesicles, which are formed by alphaviruses, flaviviruses, bromoviruses, and nodaviruses [3, 4, [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . These are small single-membrane vesicles which are pinched out from a cellular membrane, but they remain tethered to the membrane and possess a channel connecting the interior of the spherule with the cytoplasm.">

Coronaviruses infect a wide range of species, including swine, cattle, poultry, dogs, cats, horses, and humans, causing economically damaging diseases impacting livestock farming industries, significant companion animal morbidity, and important human illnesses. In the last 17 years, two novel coronaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), have emerged into the human population from zoonotic sources (bats via civets and camels, respectively) and have caused significant illnesses with high mortality rates [16, 17] . This, along with the recent emergence of swine acute diarrhea syndrome (SADS)-CoV in pigs arising after a species jump [18, 19] , highlights the importance of this family of viruses as a threat to human health with the potential for further emergence of new pathogenic viruses. There are four genera within the coronavirus family, Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma-, and Deltacoronaviruses, and the ROs of viruses within these genera have been characterized. All coronaviruses induce the formation of DMVs. In addition, there are rearrangements of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to form either a branching network of membranes, referred to as convoluted membranes (CM) found in Alphaand Betacoronavirus infected cells [20] [21] [22] [23] , or paired ER membranes, referred to as zippered ER in Gammacoronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) infected cells identified in our previous work [24, 25] . Small double-membrane spherules, not seen previously in cells infected with other coronaviruses, are associated with the zippered ER in IBV-infected cells are.">
