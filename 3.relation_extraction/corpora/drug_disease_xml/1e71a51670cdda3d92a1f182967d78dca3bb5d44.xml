We demonstrated that elevated numbers of gut-homing CD8 + T cells (which express α4β7 and CCR9 molecules) were presented in porcine inguinal lymph nodes and were recruited to the small intestine by RA. Intestinal mucosal immunity (IgA titre) and systemic immunity (serum IgG titre) were enhanced by RA. Therefore, we hypothesized that RA could induce DCs to form an immature mucosal phenotype and could recruit them to the small intestinal submucosa. Porcine T-cells expressed β7 integrin and CCR9 receptors and migrated to CCL25 by a mechanism that was dependent of activation by RA-pretreated DCs, rather than direct activation by RA. Together, our results provide powerful evidence that RA can assist whole inactivated TGEV (WI-TGEV) via subcutaneous (s.c.) immunization to generate intestinal immunity, and offer new vaccination strategies against TGEV.">

Furthermore, mucosal DCs can augment the expression of integrin α 4β 7 and the chemoattractant receptor, CCR9 on activated lymphocytes in the presence of RA 18 , which mediates their homing to the gut mucosa 21 . Therefore, in our study, we used RA combined with whole inactivated TGEV (WI-TGEV) to immunize piglets via subcutaneous (s.c.) vaccination 22 in order to induce T cell homing to the small bowel intestinal mucosa, as well as to generate more mucosal DCs. We found that these results will offer new approaches for the development of vaccine candidates against TGEV in newborn piglets.">
