Immunocompromised patients, healthcare workers (HCWs) and children contacts are at increased risk of acquiring the infection. However, the impact of asymptomatic infection in transmission has not been well studied. Objectives: this study evaluated the frequency and viral load (VL) of RSV in nasal swab samples of individuals with different risk factors for acquiring infection in a university hospital in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Methods: We included 196 symptomatic children and their 192 asymptomatic caregivers, 70 symptomatic and 95 asymptomatic HCWs, 43 samples from symptomatic HIV-positive outpatients, and 100 samples of asymptomatic HIV patients in the period of 2009-2013. Results: RSV infection was detected in 10.1% (70/696) of samples, 4.4% (17/387) of asymptomatic patients, and 17.1% (53/309) from symptomatic patients. (P &lt; .0001)."/>

RSV detection among asymptomatic caregivers (6.8%; 13/192) was significantly higher compared to other asymptomatic adults, HIV and HCWs (2.0%; 4/195; P = .0252). A close contact with an infected child at home was an important risk to RSV acquisition [OR 22.6 (95% CI 4.8-106.7)].">
