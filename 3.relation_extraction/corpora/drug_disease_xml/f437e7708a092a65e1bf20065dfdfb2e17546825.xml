This virus mainly affected children under 5 years old. There is little information on HBoV in Gabon. Two first studies was conducted to determine the prevalence of respiratory and enteric viruses in children under 5 years old who visited health centers for influenza-like illness (ILI) or diarrhea in Gabon from March 2010 to June 2011. However, HBoV was not included in the screening. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the prevalence and the HBoV genotype in children under 5 years old with ILI or diarrhea in Gabon.">

While there were no significant differences in prevalence between age groups in children with ILI, all children with diarrhea were under 12 months of age. Moreover, 84.4 and 42.8% were diagnosed in co-infections with at least one other respiratory virus, or enteric viruses respectively. Finally, HBoV subtype 1 has been detected in both respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts with very low variability.">
