We have previously used this method to detect HSV1, GBV-C, and measles virus sequence in brain tissue from deceased donors. Deep sequencing was performed on brain specimens from a cohort of patients who died with progressive forms of MS, revealing evidence of increased expression of some human endogenous retrovirus (HERV) domains.">

The resulting single-ended 50 bp sequences (reads) were compared to a non redundant viral database representing (NRVDB) all 1.2 M viral records in GenBank. A retroviral gene catalog (RVGC) was prepared by identifying human genetic loci (GRCh37.p13) homologous to domains contained in the Gypsy 2.0 retro element database. Reads were aligned to the RVGC and human transcriptome with Bowtie2. The resulting viral hit rates (VHRs) were normalized by the number of high quality reads. The expression of human genes, including HERVs, was determined using Cufflinks. Comparisons between the groups were performed using the false discovery rate.">

Comparison of the reads to the NRVDB suggested that the demyelination and OND specimens had higher VHRs against some retroviral sequences compared with the controls. This was confirmed by retroviral domain averaging. Gene expression analysis showed differential expression among some HERV sequences. Single read mapping revealed one envelope and one reverse transcriptase sequence record that were significantly enriched among the demyelination samples compared to the normal controls. Less restrictive (comprehensive) read mapping showed that 2 integrase, 2 core, 2 envelope, and 3 KRAB sequences that were overexpressed in the demyelination group."/>
