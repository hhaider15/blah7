The usefulness of outbreak detection strategies depends on their specificity; the false alarm rate affects the interpretation of alarms.">

We apply each to 12 years of emergency department visits for respiratory infection syndromes at a pediatric hospital, finding that the specificity of the five models was almost always a non-constant function of the day of the week, month, and year of the study (p &lt; 0.05). We develop an outbreak detection method, called the expectation-variance model, based on generalized additive modeling to achieve a constant specificity by accounting for not only the expected number of visits, but also the variance of the number of visits. The expectation-variance model achieves constant specificity on all three time scales, as well as earlier detection and improved sensitivity compared to traditional methods in most circumstances."/>

With constant specificity, public health practitioners can better interpret the alarms and better evaluate the cost-effectiveness of surveillance systems."/>
