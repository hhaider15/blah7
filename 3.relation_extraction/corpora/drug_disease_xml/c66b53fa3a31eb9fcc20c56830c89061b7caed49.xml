  <chunk id="c66b53fa3a31eb9fcc20c56830c89061b7caed49.c1" text="Newly emerging viral pathogens pose a constant and unpredictable threat to human and animal health. Coronaviruses (CoVs) have a penchant for sudden emergence, as evidenced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) and most recently, swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV). Small animal models of emerging viral pathogenesis are crucial to better understand the virus and host factors driving disease progression. However, rodent models are often criticized for their limited translatability to humans. The complete blood count is the most ordered clinical test in the United States serving as the cornerstone of clinical medicine and differential diagnosis. We recently generated a mouse model for MERS-CoV pathogenesis through the humanization of the orthologous entry receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4). To increase the translatability of this model, we validated and established the use of an automated veterinary hematology analyzer (VetScan HM5) at biosafety level 3 for analysis of peripheral blood. MERS-CoV lung titer peaked 2 days post infection concurrent with lymphopenia and neutrophilia in peripheral blood, two phenomena also observed in MERS-CoV infection of humans. The fluctuations in leukocyte populations measured by Vetscan HM5 were corroborated by standard flow cytometry, thus confirming the utility of this approach. Comparing a sublethal and lethal dose of MERS-CoV in mice, analysis of daily blood draws demonstrates a dose dependent modulation of leukocytes. Major leukocyte populations were modulated before weight loss was observed. Importantly, neutrophil counts on 1dpi were predictive of disease severity with a lethal dose of MERS-CoV highlighting the predictive value of hematology in this model. Taken together, the inclusion of hematological measures in mouse models of emerging viral pathogenesis increases their translatability and should elevate the preclinical evaluation of MERS-CoV therapeutics and vaccines to better mirror the complexity of the human condition. Fig 2. Peripheral leukocyte populations are modulated in MERS-CoV infection. (A) Percent starting weight of mock or MERS-CoV infected animals of mice described in Fig 1. The symbols represent the mean per time/group combined from two independent experiments and the error bars represent the standard deviation. Asterisks denote statistical significance as determined by two-way ANOVA with Sidek's multiple comparison test. (B) Virus lung titer via plaque assay of mock or MERS-CoV infected animals combined from two independent experiments. Each symbol represents the titer for a single mouse. The line is at the mean titer and the error bars represent the standard deviation. Asterisks denote statistical significance as determined by two-way ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparison test. (C) VetScan hematology analysis. Data for total white blood cells (WBCs) as well as the numbers and frequencies of lymphocytes, monocytes and neutrophils are shown. All cell frequencies are expressed as a percentage of total WBCs. Each symbol represents the data from one mouse. The line is at the mean and the error bars represent the standard error of the mean. The dotted lines represent the normal expected range of each cell type according to the manufacturer. Asterisks denote statistical significance as determined by two-way ANOVA with Sidek's multiple comparison test.">
