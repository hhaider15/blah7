Hence, it is impossible to mathematically describe, accurately and completely, a real social contact network. To create a representative synthetic contact network and to simulate a possible infectious disease outbreak based on the network, we adopt a few simplifications.">

Internal variations within each group can be simulated by assuming the possible distributions for different parameters."/>
  <chunk id="702157bbe24c5eca7ab92f90cd717c3e56aa6ccf.c3" text="Visiting time The complex patterns of individuals arriving at and leaving a location are not considered. We simplified the scenario by dividing each indoor environment into different sub-visiting locations that represent different time durations for visiting each indoor environment. Thus, several locations may represent the same indoor environment at a different time. Therefore this approach differentiates individuals who visit the same indoor environment at different times. We also assumed that individuals who choose to visit a location (an indoor environment for a fixed duration) come at the same time and leave at the same time. Hence, the visiting time of all possible visitors to a given location is the same."/>
