  <chunk id="58d1eab77cf8a541864220d8b3130336881891b7.c1" text="Ischemic cerebrovascular disease (CVD) is a relatively common condition in dogs but infrequent in cats, with acute or peracute onset of non-progressive neurological signs. Cerebellar artery infarction appears to be very uncommon in cats, with only two cases reported affecting the rostral cerebellar artery (RCA). This study aims to report for the first time the neurological signs, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings and outcome in three cats diagnosed with presumed caudal cerebellar artery (CCA) infarction. Unique presentation of vestibular signs associated with CCA in three cats and similarities between dogs and humans are discussed.">
