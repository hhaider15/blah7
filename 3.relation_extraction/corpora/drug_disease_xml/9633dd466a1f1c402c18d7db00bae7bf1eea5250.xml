All inbound passengers from dengue-endemic countries who are febrile (tympanic temperature �38˚C) undergo routine laboratory testing for dengue. We analyzed clinical and epidemiological characteristics of all tested passengers entering Taiwan via TPE in 2011 to identify the predictive factors of dengue infection. 14(12): e0225840. https://doi.org/10.">
