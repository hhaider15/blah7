HMPV-infected children with single virus (n = 106) and co-detections (n = 65) had similar clinical manifestations. No clinical differences were found between HMPV genotypes A (n = 67) and B (n = 80). The HMPV-infected children were older (median 17.2 months) than RSV-infected children (median 7.3 months, n = 859). Among single virus-infected children, no differences in age-adjusted LRTI diagnoses were found between HMPV and RSV. Age was an important factor for disease severity among single virus-infected children, where children &lt;6 months old with HMPV had a milder disease than those with RSV, while in children 12-23 months old, the pattern was the opposite. In multivariable logistic regression analysis for each virus type, age !12 months (HMPV), and age &lt;6 months (RSV), prematurity, !1 chronic disease and high viral loads of RSV, but not high HMPV viral loads, were risk factors for severe disease. and Technology.

HMPV is usually detected in airway secretions from children with RTI by use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, and the virus seldom appears in healthy children [8] . HMPV has been classified into the Pneumoviridae family. Two main genotypes (A and B) and at least four genetic subtypes (A1, A2, B1 and B2) exist [9-12]. Whether these genotypes cause similar or different infections is largely unclarified because some studies have shown quite similar manifestations [13] [14] [15] , whereas others found that either genotypes A [16, 17] or B [18] may cause more severe disease."/>

However, this was not confirmed in other studies [14, 17, 19, 23] .">

It has been reported that RSV and HMPV infections in children may be quite similar [23, 25, 26] , but there is also some evidence that RSV causes more severe disease than HMPV [6, 18] . Risk factors for severe RSV infection are young age, prematurity, chronic lung disease, chronic heart disease and severe neurological disabilities [18, 24, [27] [28] [29] [30] . Although it has not been studied to the same extent, it seems that some of these factors may also increase the risk of severe HMPV infection [2, 17, 18, 29, [31] [32] [33] . With some exceptions [18, 29] , most studies have separately dealt with risk factors for severe HMPV and RSV infections.">
