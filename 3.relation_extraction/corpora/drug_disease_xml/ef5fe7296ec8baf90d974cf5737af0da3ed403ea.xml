Limited data are available in China to describe the epidemiology of viral respiratory infections, especially in small-medium cities and rural areas."/>

The three most prevalent viruses were influenza A (IAV; 35Á8%), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV; 30Á5%) and human rhinovirus (HRV; 21Á5%). Co-infections were found in 302 cases (31Á1%), and dual viral infection was dominant. RSV, HRV and IAV were the most frequent viral agents involved in coinfection. On the whole, the obvious seasonal peaks mainly from March to May were observed with peak strength varying from 1 year to another.">

The spectrum of viruses in the study site is similar to that in other places, but the seasonality is closely related to geographic position, different from that in big cities in northern China and neighboring Hong Kong.">
