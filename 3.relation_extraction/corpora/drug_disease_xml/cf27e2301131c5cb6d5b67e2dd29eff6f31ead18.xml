  <chunk id="cf27e2301131c5cb6d5b67e2dd29eff6f31ead18.c1" text="We describe here a novel method to fit an edge-triangle model to snowball sample data. Let D u , S u and T u be the node degree, number of stubs and triangle corners at node u from an observed snowball sample. Without additional node roles we must have D u = S u +2T u . Our approach is to use an estimator p(d) of the network degree distribution"/>
