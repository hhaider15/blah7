Multiple linear regression analysis was used to identify the effect of including attitudes, social norms, selfefficacy, knowledge, risk perception and habit on hand hygiene compliance."/>
  <chunk id="fca0580d965f2ac6c66e345eab40c436d6468c66.c6" text="We included 313 students in the analysis (response of 97%). The behavioural model explained 40% of the variance in self-reported compliance (adjusted R 2 = 0.40). Hand hygiene compliance was strongly influenced by attitudes (perceived outcomes of preventive actions), self-efficacy (perception of the ability to perform hand hygiene at the clinical ward) and habit, but was not associated with knowledge and risk perception."/>

Clinical teaching environments could help them form good patient safety habits during this vital phase of their career."/>
