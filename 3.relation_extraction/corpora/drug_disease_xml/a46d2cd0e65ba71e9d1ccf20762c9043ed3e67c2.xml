However, few studies evaluate the correlation of prognosis with this characteristic. Therefore, we performed morphological and quantitative analyses of T lymphocytes in patients with NSIP and evaluated the relationship between T lymphocytes and prognosis.">

The relationship between CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocyte populations and prognosis was analyzed. Results: The mean age of 55 patients was 48.9 ± 10.5 years, and 36 (65 %) of patients were women. All patients were followed for a mean duration of 46 ± 25 months. Thirteen (23.6 %) patients died during follow-up. Perivascular CD4+ lymphocyte infiltration (HR, 0.939; 95 % CI, 0.883-0.999; p = 0.048) was an independent risk factor for survival. Perivascular infiltrates of CD4+ T lymphocytes correlated with survival time (r = 0.270, p = 0.046). Patients with improved forced vital capacity survived longer and had higher numbers of CD4+ T lymphocytes that infiltrated perivascular tissue. The densities of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes infiltrating other tissues were not significantly associated with survival time.">
