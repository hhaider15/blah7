  <chunk id="d7433f2be08b0e833cb270ee2ac736dce1e1a98e.c1" text="Tables S4.1 and S4.2 show the goodness-of-fit results (burn-in 1,000,000 iterations, 1,000,000 iterations per graph, 1000 graphs) for the multilevel exponential random graph model (ERGM) for the relationships network. Results were generated using MPNet [1] [2] [3] . Table S4 .1 shows the results for just the bipartite network. Column 1 lists the various statistics that are evaluated. Column 2 shows the value of the statistic for the empirical network (&quot;Sample&quot;). Columns 3 and 4 show the mean (&quot;Mean&quot;) and sample standard deviation (&quot;Std. Dev.&quot;), respectively, of the statistic over simulated networks. Column 5 shows the &quot;t-ratio&quot;, defined as (observed value-mean value)/standard deviation. For each parameter, using standard methodology, the model is a good fit for the empirical network if the &quot;t-ratio&quot; has absolute value less than 0.1 for parameters explicitly in the model (shown in boldface) and less than 2 otherwise."/>
