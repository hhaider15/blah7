Daily, individual humans and vectors were aged, and terminated if their age exceeded their life expectancy. Only the adult stage of a vector's life cycle was considered, since only adult vectors generally acquire and transmit the vector-borne disease. We assumed age-dependent mortalities for both the hosts and the vectors. For both the host and vector, this is governed a Weibull distribution."/>

The host and vector population were assumed to be constant, with M denoting the ratio if vectors to hosts, so a new individual immediately replaces an individual that has been the terminated."/>
