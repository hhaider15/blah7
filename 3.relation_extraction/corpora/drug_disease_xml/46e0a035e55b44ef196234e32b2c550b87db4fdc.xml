Sequence data are grouped in terms of biological relationships. The number of sequences related to any group is susceptible to be increased every day. All the present alignment-free methods approve the utility of their approaches by producing a similarity/dissimilarity matrix. Although this matrix is clear, it measures the degree of similarity among sequences individually. In our work, a representative of each of three groups of protein sequences is introduced. A similarity/dissimilarity vector is evaluated instead of the ordinary similarity/dissimilarity matrix based on the group representative. The approach is applied on three selected groups of protein sequences: beta globin, NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5 (ND5), and spike protein sequences. A cross-grouping comparison is produced to ensure the singularity of each group. A qualitative comparison between our approach, previous articles, and the phylogenetic tree of these protein sequences proved the utility of our approach.">
