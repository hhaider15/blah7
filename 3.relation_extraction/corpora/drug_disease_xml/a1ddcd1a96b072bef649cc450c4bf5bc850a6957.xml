  <chunk id="a1ddcd1a96b072bef649cc450c4bf5bc850a6957.c1" text="This review presents the up to date development of fused thiopyranothiazoles that comprise one of the thiazolidine derivatives classes. Thiazolidine and thiazolidinone-related compounds belong to the widely studied heterocycles from a medicinal chemistry perspective. From the chemical point of view, they are perfect heterodienes to undergo hetero-Diels-Alder reaction with a variety of dienophiles, yielding regio-and diastereoselectively thiopyranothiazole scaffolds. The annealing of thiazole and thiopyran cycles in condensed heterosystem is a precondition for the &quot;centers conservative&quot; creation of the ligand-target binding complex and can promote a potential selectivity to biotargets. The review covers possible therapeutic applications of thiopyrano[2,3-d]thiazoles, such as anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, anticancer as well as aniparasitic activities. Thus, thiopyrano[2,3-d]thiazoles may be used as powerful tools in the development of biologically active agents and drug-like molecules.">
