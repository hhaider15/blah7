The in-hospital mortality rate was lowest (33.5%) in the youngest patients (age 18-29 years) and highest (68.2%) in the oldest patients (&gt;80 years, P &lt; 0.001). The overall 1-year mortality rate was 72.1%, and decreased from 75.8% to 54.7% during the study period.

Although the overall incidence was lower than has been reported in a prospective US study, this may reflect underdiagnosis by International Classification of Diseases, 9th edition code and identification of only patients with more severe ARDS in this analysis. Overall, there has been a decreasing trend in in-hospital and 1year mortality rates in recent years, likely because of the implementation of lung-protective ventilation.
