We aimed to estimate the sensitivity of influenza testing in Canada based on results of a national respiratory virus surveillance system.">

Sensitivity was calculated as the number of influenza positive tests divided by the number of influenza positive tests plus the model-estimated number of false negative tests. The sensitivity of influenza testing was estimated to be 33% (95%CI 32-34%), varying from 30-40% depending on the season and region.">

A number of factors may explain this difference, including sample quality and specimen procurement issues as well as test characteristics. Improved diagnosis would permit better estimation of the burden of influenza.">
