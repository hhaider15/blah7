  <chunk id="c899a0907dc026208ece3df9c6d4b3c909c6dd46.c1" text="Introduction Accurate and timely diagnosis of communityacquired bacterial infections in patients with systemic inflammation remains challenging both for clinician and laboratory. Combinations of markers, as opposed to single ones, may improve diagnosis and thereby survival. We therefore compared the diagnostic characteristics of novel and routinely used biomarkers of sepsis alone and in combination."/>
  <chunk id="c899a0907dc026208ece3df9c6d4b3c909c6dd46.c2" text="Methods This prospective cohort study included patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome who were suspected of having community-acquired infections. It was conducted in a medical emergency department and department of infectious diseases at a university hospital. A multiplex immunoassay measuring soluble urokinase-type plasminogen activator (suPAR) and soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (sTREM)-1 and macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) was used in parallel with standard measurements of Creactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), and neutrophils. Two composite markers were constructed -one including a linear combination of the three best performing markers and another including all six -and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to compare their performance and those of the individual markers.">
