  <chunk id="24db4d088787fb5c43f2f60604e1f1463d4b4082.c1" text="A new cell line derived from the kidney of European eel, Anguilla anguilla, has been established and characterized. This cell line, designated as EK (eel kidney), has been maintained in Leibovitz's L-15 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum for over 24 months, and subcultured more than 60 times. This cell line consists predominantly of fibroblast-like cells, and can grow at 15-37°C under an optimum temperature of 26°C. The origin of this cell line was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and 18s recombinant (r)RNA sequencing. The chromosome analysis of EK cells at passage 58 revealed an ananeuploid karyotype. The EK cells were successfully transfected with the Pegfp-N1 plasmid, suggesting its potential in genetic studies. The susceptibility test showed a significant cytopathic effect (CPE) in EK cells for Rana grylio virus, and the viral replication was evidenced with quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) assay. After poly (I:C) stimulation, the expression of the immune-related molecules including interferon regulatory factor-3 (irf3), interferon regulatory factor-7 (irf7) and cytochrome P450 (CYP450) were significantly upregulated in EK cells, while the expression of transforming growth factor (TGF-β) was downregulated. These results suggested the potential of EK cell line as a model in gene engineering, virus identification and environmental toxicology.">
