No standardised technique has been reported specifically for viral sampling in the sinonasal passages.">

DNA and RNA were extracted from the samples and underwent PCR or RT-PCR testing, respectively, for a panel of 15 common upper respiratory tract viruses.">

The mean number of viruses identified at the two sites were similar (0.875 ± 0.899 at the MM vs. 0.750 ± 1.032 at the IM). 6/24 (25%) of patients showed no virus at either site, while 3/24 (12.5%) demonstrated the same viral species at both sites."/>

It is therefore recommended that both sites are sampled in the clinical and research setting better to characterise the viral species within the nasal cavity."/>
