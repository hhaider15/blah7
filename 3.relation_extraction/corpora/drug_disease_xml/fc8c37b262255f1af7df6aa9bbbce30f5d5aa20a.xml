  <chunk id="fc8c37b262255f1af7df6aa9bbbce30f5d5aa20a.c1" text=". Original antigenic sin in 10-valent inactivated HRV-vaccinated mice. Mice (20 per group) were vaccinated i.m. with either PBS + alum or 2-valent (HRV-16 and HRV-76) inactivated HRV + alum in order to establish pre-existing immunity to types 16 and 76 in one group. (a) Sera were collected 18 days later and tested for nAb against HRV-16 and HRV-76. All mice were vaccinated i.m at day 28 and boosted at day 56 with 10-valent inactivated HRV that included types 16 and 76 (10-valent composition listed in Supplementary Table 2) . Sera were collected at days 46 (b) and 74 (c) and pooled for each group for nAb against the 10 types in the vacccine. Error bars show 95% confidence interval. The dashed line represents LOD. Undetectable nAb were assigned LOD/2.">
