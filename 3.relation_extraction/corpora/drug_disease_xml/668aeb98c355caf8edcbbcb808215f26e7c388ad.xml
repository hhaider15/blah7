However, little is known about the regulatory role of autophagy in transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) replication. In this study, we found that TGEV infection increased the number of autophagosome-like double-and single-membrane vesicles in the cytoplasm of host cells, a phenomenon that is known to be related to autophagy. In addition, virus replication was required for the increased amount of the autophagosome marker protein LC3-II. Autophagic flux occurred in TGEV-infected cells, suggesting that TGEV infection triggered a complete autophagic response. When autophagy was pharmacologically inhibited by wortmannin or LY294002, TGEV replication increased. The increase in virus yield via autophagy inhibition was further confirmed by the use of siRNA duplexes, through which three proteins required for autophagy were depleted. Furthermore, TGEV replication was inhibited when autophagy was activated by rapamycin. The antiviral response of autophagy was confirmed by using siRNA to reduce the expression of gene p300, which otherwise inhibits autophagy. Together, the results indicate that TGEV infection activates autophagy and that autophagy then inhibits further TGEV replication.">

The representative members in each genus are transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) from alphacoronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS-CoV) from betacoronavirus, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) from gammacoronavirus, and Bulbut-CoV from Deltacoronavirus 4 .

  <chunk id="668aeb98c355caf8edcbbcb808215f26e7c388ad.c3" text="Coronaviruses infections are initiated by the binding of virons to cellular receptors. During infection, coronaviruses replicate in the host cytoplasm, where the viral genome becomes available for translation. The replicative structures of MHV form as double membrane vesicles (DMVs) in the cytoplasm 5-8 . DMVs are usually rare in normal cells, but large numbers of double-membrane structures called autophagosomes are usually induced by activation of the cellular autophagy machinery 9 . This suggests that DMVs induced by coronavirus infection are of autophagic origin. Autophagy is not only a cellular physiological pathway for self-degradation, i.e., a pathway for removal of damaged cellular components and for the degradation of unwanted products, but is also a defense mechanism that protects hosts against infection by bacteria 10 . Over the past several years, there has been a rapid increase in the number of studies, including the members of Togviridae, Picornaviridae, Orthromyxoviridae and et al., see reviews [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] .">

However, the work performed to date has focused mainly on the betacoronaviruses MHV and SARS-CoV and on the gammacoronavirus IBV.
