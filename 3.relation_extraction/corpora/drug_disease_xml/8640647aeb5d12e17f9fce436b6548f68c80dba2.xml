(11) to 694 project the expected behavior of an epidemic outcome Z using the accrued observation 695 Y i at time t i , one needs access to a stochastic simulator to sample from the random 696 variable Z|ν i for a given set of parameter values θ. We use the Gillespie algorithm [40] 697 for this purpose. To describe the steps of the Gillespie algorithm, we consider an 698 epidemic model with K compartments (e.g. in the model described in ➜ &quot;Design of the 699 Performance Analysis&quot;, K = 4). Let ν(t) = (ν 1 (t), ν 2 (t), . . . , ν K (t)) denote the state of 700 the epidemic at time t, where ν k (t) denotes the number of individuals in compartment 701 k ∈ {1, 2, . . . , K} at time t."/>

We use Q to denote the number of such events. In the model shown in Fig 3, 705 these epidemic events include Infection, Seeking Treatment, and Recovery (and hence 706 Q = 3). Let Λ q (ν(t), θ) denote the rate at which the event q is occurring when the 707 epidemic is at state ν(t) and with parameter values θ that is a transformation of the 708 parameter θ.">
