  <chunk id="9697849eeaed7f72a196d9ca4d4d8cfad6a8031e.c1" text="H7N9 influenza virus has been circulating among humans for five epidemic waves since it was first isolated in 2013 in China. The recent increase in H7N9 infections during the fifth outbreak in China has caused concerns of a possible pandemic. In this study, we describe a previously characterized human monoclonal antibody, HNIgGA6, obtained by isolating rearranged heavy-chain and light-chain genes from patients who had recovered from H7N9 infections. HNIgGA6 recognized multiple HAs and neutralized the infectivity of 11 out of the 12 H7N9 strains tested, as well as three emerging HPAI H7N9 isolates. The only resistant strain was A/Shanghai/1/2013 (H7N9-SH1), which carries the avian receptor alleles 186V and 226Q in the sialic acid-binding pocket. The mAb broadly neutralized divergent H7N9 strains from 2013 to 2017 and represents a potential alternative treatment for H7N9 interventions.">
