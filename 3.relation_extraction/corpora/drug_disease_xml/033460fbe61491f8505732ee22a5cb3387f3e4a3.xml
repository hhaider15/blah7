In this study, 211 diarrheic fecal samples were collected from 25 farms across six provinces in China, between November 2017 and September 2018. 20.4% of the samples were detected as BNoV-positive by RT-PCR. Phylogenetic analyses based on RdRp, VP1, and VP2 fragments revealed these BNoV strains had unique evolutionary characteristics. The complete genome of strain Bo/BET-17/18/CH was successfully sequenced. It was 7321 nucleotides (nt) in length, shared 79.4-80.9% nt identity with all five BNoV genomes, clustered on a separate branch of the phylogenetic tree, suggesting that strain Bo/BET-17/18/CH could represent a novel BNoV strain. Two interesting characteristics were found in the genome: (i) the VP1 sequence differed greatly from known BNoV VP1 sequences; (ii) a recombination event is predicted within the ORF1-ORF2 overlap. Moreover 16.3% (7/43) of the BNoV were identified as the novel VP1 genotype, which were distributed on four farms across two provinces, indicating that the novel VP1 genotype strain has spread. To our knowledge, this is first description of the molecular and genomic characteristics of BNoV in China. These findings extend our understanding of the genetic evolution and epidemics of BnoV.">
