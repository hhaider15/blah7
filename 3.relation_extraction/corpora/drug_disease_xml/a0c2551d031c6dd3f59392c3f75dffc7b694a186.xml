However, general use of the technique is hampered by its complexity and the lack of standardization."/>

The specificity and sensitivity of the assay were evaluated on blood samples from 60 Chagas non-endemic and 48 endemic control persons and on biological samples from 33 patients, 7 reservoir animals, and 14 vectors collected in Chile."/>

The test showed a specificity of 100% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 96.6%-100%) on the control samples and a sensitivity of 93.9% (95% CI: 80.4%-98.3%), 100% (95% CI: 64.6%-100%), and 100% (95% CI: 78.5%-100%) on the human, rodent, and vector samples, respectively.">
