The median age was 63 years (47% ≥65 years and 5Á2% &lt;5 years). During hospitalization, 51 of 230 (22%) patients required intubation, 120 of 297 (40%) were admitted to intensive care unit, and 28 of 278 (10%) died. Influenza vaccination was 56%. Of 309 cases tested, 49 (16%) were positive for influenza viruses, 25 (8Á1%) for human metapneumovirus, 20 (6Á5%) for parainfluenza viruses, 16 (5Á2%) for coronavirus, 11 (3Á6%) for respiratory syncytial virus, 10 (3Á2%) for rhinovirus, 4 (1Á3%) for rhinovirus/ enterovirus, 3 (1Á0%) for enteroviruses, and 3 (1Á0%) for adenovirus. Among the 49 influenza-positive specimens, 76% were influenza A (19 H3N2, 17 H1N1pdm09, and 1 not subtyped), and 24% were influenza B.">
