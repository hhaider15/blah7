Because interferon-gamma (IFN-c) plays an important role in inflammation, this work assessed IFN-c single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) that may be associated with sepsis.">

  <chunk id="89e039e0e861069bedfb158e43844d3730b5abbb.c2" text="Methods: A total of 196 patients with pneumonia-induced sepsis and 213 age-and sex-matched healthy volunteers participated in our study from July 2012 to July 2013 in Guangzhou, China. Patient clinical information was collected. Clinical pathology was assessed in subgroups defined based on clinical criteria, APACHE II (acute physiology and chronic health evaluation) and SOFA (sepsis-related organ failure assessment) scores and discharge rate. Four functional SNPs, 21616T/C (rs2069705), 2764G/C (rs2069707), +874A/T (rs2430561) and +3234C/T (rs2069718), were genotyped by Snapshot in both sepsis patients and healthy controls. Pearson's chi-square test or Fisher's exact test were used to analyze the distribution of the SNPs, and the probability values (P values), odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated."/>

The +874A/T and +3234C/T SNPs were in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) (r 2 = 0.894). The 21616 TC+TT, +874 AT+AA genotype and the TAC haplotype were significantly associated with sepsis susceptibility, while the CTT haplotype was associated with protection against sepsis incidence. Genotype of 21616 TT wasn't only protective against severity of sepsis, but also against higher APACHE II and SOFA scores as +874 AA and +3234 CC. The TAC haplotype was was protective against progression to severe sepsis either.">
