The placing of entire cities in 'lockdown' directly affects urban economies on a multi-lateral level, including from social and economic standpoints. This is being emphasised as the outbreak gains ground in other countries, leading towards a global health emergency, and as global collaboration is sought in numerous quarters. However, while effective protocols in regard to the sharing of health data is emphasised, urban data, on the other hand, specifically relating to urban health and safe city concepts, is still viewed from a nationalist perspective as solely benefiting a nation's economy and its economic and political influence. This perspective paper, written one month after detection and during the outbreak, surveys the virus outbreak from an urban standpoint and advances how smart city networks should work towards enhancing standardization protocols for increased data sharing in the event of outbreaks or disasters, leading to better global understanding and management of the same.">

On this front, it is argued that the lack of standardization between smart city technology suppliers can lead and is leading to noncommunication between cities and data platforms. Such can, and is, resulting in a non-productive system in the case of virus outbreaks because early detection and management of the same can become increasingly dependent upon the technological backbone of smart cities. This paper thus highlights the urgent need to work towards the standardization of protocols for enhanced smart city communication and the need to democratize the smart city technology sphere to encourage equity and transparency amongst stakeholders, thereby providing more possible cooperation in the case of disasters.">
