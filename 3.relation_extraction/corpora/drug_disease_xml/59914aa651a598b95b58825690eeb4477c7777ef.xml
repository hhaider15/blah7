Study subjects included adults (aged ≥18 years) with pneumococcal pneumonia who had undergone laboratory tests for RVI. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify risk factors associated with severe pneumococcal pneumonia, defined as severity with the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) score ≥91.">

Preceding RVIs were detected in 48 patients, including influenza A virus (n = 20), influenza B virus (n = 4), parainfluenza viruses (n = 5), metapneumovirus (n = 4), rhinovirus (n = 4), respiratory syncytial viruses (n = 6), coronaviruses (n = 2), and mixed viral infections (n = 3). In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, preceding RVIs (odds ratio [OR], 2Á49; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1Á10-5Á60), male sex (OR, 2Á58; 95% CI, 1Á24-5Á38), old age (OR, 2Á92; 95% CI, 1Á37-6Á24), hypoalbuminemia (OR, 3Á26; 95% CI, 1Á56-6Á84)], and azotemia (OR, 2Á24; 95% CI, 1Á08-4Á67) were significantly associated with severe pneumococcal pneumonia.">
