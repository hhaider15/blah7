  <chunk id="bc343b504f04146857602c5800c99ab7d08162d1.c1" text="Background: Upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs), including rhinitis, nasopharyngitis, tonsillitis and otitis media (OM), comprise of 88% of total respiratory infections, especially in children. Therefore effective prevention and treatment of RTIs remain a high priority worldwide. Preclinical and clinical data highlight the rationale for the use and effectiveness of immunity-targeted approaches, including targeted immunisations and nonspecific immunomodulation in the prevention and management of recurrent upper RTIs.">

In total, 84 articles were retrieved and reviewed. Two independent researchers focused on primary and secondary endpoints in systematic reviews, metaanalyses and randomised, controlled trials, using immunity-directed strategies as the control group or within a subpopulation of larger studies. Existing guidelines and interventional/observational studies on novel applications were also included."/>
  <chunk id="bc343b504f04146857602c5800c99ab7d08162d1.c4" text="Results: Children are particularly susceptible to RTIs due to the relative immaturity of their immune systems, as well as other potential predisposing factors such as day care attendance and/or toxic environmental factors (eg increased pathogenic microbial exposure and air pollutants). Recurrent URTIs can affect otherwise healthy children, leading to clinical sequelae and complications, including the development of chronic conditions or the need for surgery. Available pre-clinical and clinical data highlight the rationale for the use and effectiveness of immunity-targeted approaches, including targeted immunisations (flu and pneumococcal vaccines) and non-specific immunomodulation (bacterial lysates), in the prevention and management of recurrent croup, tonsillitis, otitis media, recurrent acute rhinosinusitis and chronic rhinosinusitis.">
