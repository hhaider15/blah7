  <chunk id="cde537507323b28a413a559c934c435b24546c63.c1" text="Mammalian orthoreoviruses (MRVs) have a wide geographic distribution and can infect virtually all mammals. Infections in humans may be either symptomatic or asymptomatic. This study describes the isolation and identification of a natural reassortant MRV from least horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus pusillu) in China, referred to as RpMRV-YN2012."/>

Negative-staining electron microscopy revealed that RpMRV-YN2012 was a non-enveloped icosahedral virus with *75 nm in diameter. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) migration patterns of the genome segments showed that RpMRV-YN2012 contained 10 segments in a 3:3:4 arrangement. The whole genome sequence of RpMRV2012 was determined. The consensus terminal sequences of all segments of 5'-GCUAh. . .yUCAUC-3' (h = A, U or C; y = C or U) were similar to the MRV species within the genus Orthoreovirus. Its evolution and evidence of genetic reassortment were analyzed by sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis. The results showed that RpMRV-YN2012 is a novel serotype 2 MRV that may have originated from reassortment among bat, human, and/or pig MRV strains which associated with diarrhea, acute gastroenteritis and necrotizing encephalopathy in animals and humans.">

The fresh urine and fecal samples were collected at the following morning (approximately 7:30 to 8:00). Pharyngeal swab and anal swab samples from captured bats were immersed into maintenance media in a virus sampling tube (Yocon, China). After collecting the swab samples, all bats were released at their capture site. The samples were transported to the laboratory under chilled conditions and stored at −80°C until being processed.">
