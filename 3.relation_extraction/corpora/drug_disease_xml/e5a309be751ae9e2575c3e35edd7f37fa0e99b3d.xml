We then present a detailed analysis of selected virus sequences in the avian samples that were somewhat similar to known viruses, and had good quality (Q20 or higher) and quantity of next-generation sequencing reads, and was of interest from a virological point of view, for example, avian coronavirus and avian paramyxovirus 6. Some of these viruses were closely related to known viruses while others were more distantly related with 70% or less identity to currently known/ sequenced viruses. Besides detecting viruses, the technique also allowed the characterisation of host mitochondrial DNA present and thus identifying host species, while ribosomal RNA sequences provided insight into the &quot;ribosomal activity microbiome&quot;; of gut parasites; and of food eaten such as plants or insects, which we correlated to non-avian host associated viruses.">

  <chunk id="e5a309be751ae9e2575c3e35edd7f37fa0e99b3d.c2" text="Detection and characterisation of viruses by metagenomics (VM) is a relatively new technique that takes advantage of the sensitivity of next-generation sequencing (NGS) while being broadly non-specific for any particular virus present in a given sample. Virus communities (viromes) are structurally and functionally diverse and distinct to habitats in hosts and environments, and prior to VM there was limited understanding of the virome present in human and non-human hosts. Now with the growing use of VM, information on eukaryotic viruses, prokaryotic viruses and even viruses that infect other viruses are increasing 1-5 . The objectives of the physical preparation of samples for metagenomic sequencing of viruses are (i) to eliminate as many nucleic acids from the host and other elements like bacteria, fungi, parasites and, (ii) to ensure that as much of the virus nucleic acids are retained during the entire process and (iii) to generate good quality NGS reads.">

Among such proposed protocols, one designated NetoVIR by N et al. 6 was optimised on mock communities and later tested on actual and complex biological samples by the same research group 11-13 . The latter testing was performed without spiking the biological samples with known viruses, which would have served as a useful positive control to validate the protocol. As the overall aim of our project was to detect and characterise viruses in faecal samples from wild birds in Australia, we initially evaluated and compared the existing protocol (NetoVIR), including some additional modifications, and determined the optimum procedure for robust virus detection and characterisation in spiked and non-spiked bird faecal samples. Furthermore, we adopted the protocol downstream of the nucleic acid purification for library preparation and sequencing on the Ion Torrent platform. Using the optimised method, we identified viruses present in selected faecal samples from a Muscovy duck (designated as MUD) and a group of Pacific black ducks (designated as MAD) and from selected human faecal samples to show the broad applicability of the method. Finally, we demonstrate that additional information can be extracted from the sequencing reads, e.g. derived from mitochondrial DNA and ribosomal RNA present in the samples, allowing identification of host species, parasites present, food eaten and faecal bacterial populations present.
