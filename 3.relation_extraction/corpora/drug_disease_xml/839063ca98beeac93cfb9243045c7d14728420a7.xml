  <chunk id="839063ca98beeac93cfb9243045c7d14728420a7.c1" text="Background: Western European porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) strains cause limited and mild clinical signs whereas more virulent strains are circulating in Eastern Europe. The emergence of such highly virulent strains in Western Europe might result in severe clinical problems and a financial disaster. In this context, the efficacy of the commercial modified-live PRRSV subtype 1 vaccine UNISTRAIN ® PRRS was tested upon challenge with the East European subtype 3 PRRSV strain Lena. Results: The mean duration of fever was shortened and the number of fever days was significantly lower in vaccinated pigs than in control pigs. Moreover, a lower number of vaccinated animals showed fever, respiratory disorders and conjunctivitis. The mean virus titers in the nasal secretions post challenge (AUC) were significantly lower in the vaccinated group than in the control group. The duration of viremia was slightly shorter (not significantly different) in the vaccinated group as compared to the control group. Conclusions: Vaccination of pigs with the modified-live vaccine UNISTRAIN ® PRRS provides a partial clinical and virological protection against the PRRSV subtype 3 strain Lena.">
