  <chunk id="36e757c81ded2a278e917ab9030d1f682e4c4b9f.c1" text="Background and Objective: Every year 2-3 million Muslims gather for a few days around the Holy city of Makkah in Saudi Arabia to perform Hajj. Managing enormous health issues associated with such a mass gathering requires a very vibrant health delivery plan. Related research is part of the strategy. This study was done to assess the pattern of patients and illnesses encountered at one health facility at Arafat on the 2nd day of Hajj, when all the pilgrims move from Mina and stay in Arafat for a few hours . The objective of the study was to provide input so that recommendations can be given for future improvement of health care during this mass transit. Methods: All patients reporting sick to the Nimra Hospital on the Day of Arafat were included and documented on a detailed Performa and analyzed. Results: We received 211 patients, essentially all of those were in need of acute medical intervention. Acute severe asthma and injuries were the major problems encountered. There were two deaths both related to heat stroke. Patients received were predominantly Arabic speaking. Conclusions: Only those needing acute intervention seek medical advice during transit. Well equipped and staffed health facilities are, however, needed to cater these and for any mass casualties. Pre Hajj training and mandatory Flu vaccination can help.">
