The current study investigated the prevalence and risk factors of BRSV in cattle in the Nineveh Province, Iraq."/>
  <chunk id="437a7f66e0cb7f9fdf9d6b3ff4da80939e9ac546.c2" text="Between September 2017 and September 2018, 450 serum samples were collected from nonvaccinated cattle of different ages and breeds for BRSV testing. The epidemiological information of the animals was recorded. The prevalence of the disease was determined using an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit.">

  <chunk id="437a7f66e0cb7f9fdf9d6b3ff4da80939e9ac546.c3" text="The prevalence of BRSV was 83.11%, and it was significantly (p&lt;0.05) higher in cattle aged greater than 7 months-1.5 years than in older animals; in imported cattle than in Native animals; and in animals originating from large herds (100 animals) than in those from smaller herds (40 animals). There was no significant difference between BRSV prevalence in male and female animals. When samples from different regions of the Nineveh Governorate were compared, the northern region was associated with the highest prevalence of the disease. Samples harvested in the winter displayed the highest BRSV titer, compared to those collected during the other seasons."/>
  <chunk id="437a7f66e0cb7f9fdf9d6b3ff4da80939e9ac546.c4" text="Conclusion: BRSV is prevalent in cattle from the Nineveh Governorate. Risk factors such as animal age, origin, herd size, and the herd's geographical location are associated with an increased prevalence of the disease in this region. Routine vaccination programs should be adopted to reduce the prevalence of BRSV.">
