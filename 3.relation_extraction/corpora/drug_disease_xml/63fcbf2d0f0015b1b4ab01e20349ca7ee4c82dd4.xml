Members of this family include both human pathogens, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS-CoV) 1 , and animal pathogens, such as porcine epidemic diarrhea virus 2 . Currently, the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) recognizes four genera in the Coronaviridae family: Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus and Deltacoronavirus. While the reservoirs of the Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus genera are believed to be bats, the Gammacoronavirus and Deltacoronavirus genera have been shown to spread primarily through birds 3 . The first three species of the Deltacoronavirus genus were discovered in 2009 4 and recent work has vastly expanded the Deltacoronavirus genus, adding seven additional species 3 .">

  <chunk id="63fcbf2d0f0015b1b4ab01e20349ca7ee4c82dd4.c4" text="By contrast relatively few species within the Gammacoronavirus genus have been identified. There are currently two recognized species in the Gammacoronavirus genus: avian coronavirus (ACoV) and beluga whale coronavirus SW1 (SW1). ACoVs infect multiple avian hosts and include several important poultry pathogens, such as infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and turkey coronavirus (TCoV) 5 . IBV was first described in the United States 6 but has since been described around the globe 7 . Turkey Coronavirus is the cause of acute enteritis in domestic turkeys 8 . The second species in the Gammacornavirus genus SW1 was first discovered in beluga whales 9 but has since been detected in other cetaceans, such as Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins 10 . Despite IBV being the first discovered coronavirus and the impact it has on the poultry industry 11 , the number of identified species within the Gammacoronavirus genus remains small in comparison to the other coronavirus genera. Coronaviruses from several other avian hosts for which partial sequences are available suggest relatedness to IBV and TCoV. These viruses, which include goose coronavirus (GCoV), were tentatively classified as part of the ACoV species. An approximately 3 kb region, including the nucleocapsid gene and several accessory genes, of GCoV were previously sequenced from a greylag goose in Norway 12 .">
