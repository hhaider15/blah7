Our recent studies have found that one subset of hematopoietic cells can be induced to dedifferentiate into multipotent stem cells by means of a proliferating fibroblast releasable factor, M-CSF. Understanding the importance of stem cells on skin wound healing, here we evaluate the biological significance of M-CSF on skin wound healing. In an in vivo mouse skin excisional wound model, we found that SSEA-positive stem cells were present in wounded but not normal skin. After isolating skin cells from either normal or wounded skin by collagenase digestion, and analyzing the SSEA-1 positive cells by flow cytometry, we found a significant increase in the number of SSEA-1 positive cells in wounded skin. Topical application of M-CSF in skin wounds accelerated healing remarkably, while application of M-CSF-neutralizing antibody slowed wound healing."/>
  <chunk id="6907124581ac28f6712e3676396cfc4a3b8a9502.c2" text="Skin wound healing proceeds through several overlapping patterns of events: coagulation, inflammation response, migration and proliferation of local resident cells, and tissue remodeling. The inflammation phase begins at the time of injury and lasts for 24 to 48 hours. In this phase, neutrophils and macrophages infiltrate from circulation into the wound site and cooperate to remove necrotic tissue, debris, and bacteria from the wound. CD4 + T lymphocytes including regulatory T cells also infiltrate to the wound site, but their role in wound healing is still unclear. In the migration and proliferation phase, epithelial cells and fibroblasts migrate from the edge of the wound toward the wound site and proliferate after receiving signals from platelets and inflammatory cells. The last phase of healing is tissue remodeling, beginning at about two to three weeks and lasting up to two years. Wound healing largely relies on the coordinated activation of resident cells and the infiltration of blood cells 1 . In addition, endogenous adult stem cells are considered to be key contributors to replenishing lost cells after injury. Studies have shown that adult stem cells could contribute to liver regeneration 2,3 , lung regeneration 4,5 , neuron regeneration 6,7 , heart repair 8,9 and kidney repair 10, 11 . Under the skin, after injury, stem cells from hair follicles 12 and sweat glands 13 at the edge of the uninjured area can migrate into the wound site and help support re-epithelialization and granulation.">

We have recently identified a proliferating fibroblast-releasable factor, macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), which can directly induce a subset of hematopoietic cells to be dedifferentiated into multipotent stem cells that are positive for stage-specific embryonic antigen-1 and -3 (SSEA-1 and SSEA-3) at the physiological concentration 24 . We have demonstrated that these hematopoietic cell-derived multipotent stem cells do in fact have the capacity to be differentiated into the cell type of three germ layers in vitro 24 .">
