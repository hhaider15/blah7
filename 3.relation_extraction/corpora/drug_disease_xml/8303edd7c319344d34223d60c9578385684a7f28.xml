Surveillance and largescale whole-genome sequencing of RSV is currently limited but would help identify its evolutionary dynamics and sites of selective immune evasion. In this study, we performed complete-genome nextgeneration sequencing of 92 RSV isolates from infants in central Tennessee during the 2012-2014 RSV seasons. We identified multiple co-circulating clades of RSV from both the A and B groups. Each clade is defined by signature N-and O-linked glycosylation patterns. Analyses of specific RSV genes revealed high rates of positive selection in the attachment (G) gene. We identified RSV-A viruses in circulation with and without a recently reported 72-nucleotide G gene sequence duplication. Furthermore, we show evidence of convergent evolution of G gene sequence duplication and fixation over time, which suggests a potential fitness advantage of RSV with the G sequence duplication."/>

In 2005, RSV caused an estimated 33.8 million new episodes of ALRIs in children under five worldwide, with 3.4 million cases requiring hospitalization due to severe illness 1,7,8 . Global estimates of disease burden show RSV to account for 30 million ALRIs and 50,000 annual deaths of children &lt; five years of age 1, 7, 8 . Nearly all children have had at least one RSV infection by two years of age 7 . It is well established that RSV infections during infancy (&lt; six months of age) are associated with an increased incidence of subsequent childhood wheezing and asthma 9 . Despite its global public health impact, no licensed vaccines nor effective treatments for acute infection are currently available for RSV 9 . The only approved prophylaxis is passive immunization with palivizumab, a humanized mouse monoclonal antibody against the RSV fusion (F) protein 10,11 . The efficacy trials of palivizumab resulted in a 39-78% decrease in hospitalization rates for RSV in premature infants and children with chronic lung disease 10 ; however, a recent review shows inconsistent cost-effectiveness of palivizumab 12 .">

The 11 RSV proteins include the polymerase (L), nucleocapsid (N), phosphoprotein (P), transcriptional regulators (M2-1, M2-2), matrix (M), small hydrophobic protein (SH), non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2) and two major surface glycoproteins (F and G) that are responsible for virus entry and are the major target of human immune responses. The F protein is responsible for the fusion of the viral envelop with the host cell membrane for the viral entry into the cell. The attachment G protein has a short cytoplasmic domain followed by a transmembrane domain and two hypervariable mucin-like domains joined by a conserved sequence, which is responsible for cellular attachment. The G protein also has an immune decoy function in its soluble, extracellularly secreted form.">

RSV can be classified into two antigenic groups (A and B), each containing several distinct subgroups based on antigenic and genomic sequence differences, especially in the G glycoprotein 15-17 . Studies suggest group A viruses cause more severe disease and transmit more readily than group B viruses in infants 9 . These two groups tend to alternate in prevalence between RSV seasons and also show evidence of multiple co-circulating intra-group viral genotypes, or clades, during any given season 9, 13, 16, 18, 19 , resulting in a diverse set of circulating viruses that can adapt to herd immunity. It is unclear if this represents a gradual evolution of viral genomes or stochastic differences in infection rates by co-circulating strains.">
