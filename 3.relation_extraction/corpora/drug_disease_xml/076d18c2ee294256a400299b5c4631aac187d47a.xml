  <chunk id="076d18c2ee294256a400299b5c4631aac187d47a.c1" text="Background: Since late April, 2009, a novel influenza virus A (H1N1), generally referred to as the ''swine flu,'' has spread around the globe and infected hundreds of thousands of people. During the first few days after the initial outbreak in Mexico, extensive media coverage together with a high degree of uncertainty about the transmissibility and mortality rate associated with the virus caused widespread concern in the population. The spread of an infectious disease can be strongly influenced by behavioral changes (e.g., social distancing) during the early phase of an epidemic, but data on risk perception and behavioral response to a novel virus is usually collected with a substantial delay or after an epidemic has run its course.">
