We will conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the prevalence and factors associated with respiratory viral infection in people of all ages with ARTI residing in Africa.">

  <chunk id="8da224b5eba13cee28c3a95cb3c1e3c4d26e5a3a.c2" text="Methods: This work will include cross-sectional studies published between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2017, without any language restriction, on populations residing in African countries. We will consider studies that reported the prevalence of respiratory viruses in people with ARTI confirmed by a polymerase chain reaction technique. We will be searching PubMed, Embase, African Journals Online, Web of Science, and Global Index Medicus. The selection of relevant studies, extraction of data, and evaluation of the quality of the articles will be carried out independently by two review authors, and the discrepancies will be resolved by consensus or intervention of a third author. The heterogeneity of the studies will be assessed using the Ï‡ 2 test on Cochrane's Q statistic. Publication bias will be assessed by the Egger test. Studies will be pooled using a random-effect meta-analysis model. Results will be presented by age group and subregion of Africa. Using meta-regression models, we will identify factors associated with viral infections in people with ARTI."/>
  <chunk id="8da224b5eba13cee28c3a95cb3c1e3c4d26e5a3a.c3" text="Discussion: This systematic review and meta-analysis is based on published data and therefore does not require ethical approval. This work will serve as a basis for the development of strategies for prevention and control ARTI in Africa and will also serve to identify data gaps and guide future investigations. The final report will be published in peer-reviewed journals as a scientific article and presented in workshops, conferences, and scientific conferences. Systematic review registration: PROSPERO, CRD42018088261."/>
