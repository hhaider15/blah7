The human rhinovirus (HRV) has been suggested to have delayed the pandemic through viral interference. The importance of co-infections over time during the pandemic and in terms of severity of the disease needs to be assessed.">

A secondary aim was to investigate if co-infections were associated with severity of disease.">

Respiratory samples were analyzed for a panel of 16 viruses by real-time polymerase chain reaction."/>

Of these, 85.4% were single infections and 14.6% coinfections (2-4 viruses). The number of co-infections increased throughout the study period. H1N1 was found in 83 (16.5%) children and of these 12 (14.5%) were co-infections. HRV and H1N1 circulated to a large extent at the same time and 6.0% of the H1N1-positive children were also positive for HRV. There was no correlation between co-infections and severity of disease in children with H1N1.">

Population-based longitudinal studies with repeated sampling are needed to improve the understanding of the importance of co-infections and viral interference."/>
