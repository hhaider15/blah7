  <chunk id="d10f84b9e2232aef0a3d90771b3f861208456d2d.c3" text="Rhinoviruses in Lower Respiratory Tract a distinct phylogenetic group; only strains RI/HR409-18 (along with a reference strain MF978777) clustered with RV-C strains. Strains belonging to the group C were the most diverse (41.6% identity among strains), while group B was the most conserved (71.5% identity among strains). Despite such differences in strain groups (hitherto undescribed in Croatia), clinical presentation of infected children was rather similar. Our results are consistent with newer studies that investigated the etiology of acute respiratory infections, especially those focused on children with lower respiratory tract infections, where RVs should always be considered as potentially serious pathogens."/>
