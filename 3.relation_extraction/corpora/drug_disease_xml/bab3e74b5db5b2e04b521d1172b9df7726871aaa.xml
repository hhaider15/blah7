However, the trilateral relationship among them remains unclear."/>

  <chunk id="bab3e74b5db5b2e04b521d1172b9df7726871aaa.c3" text="Methods: Six hundred thirty college students from two general universities completed a questionnaire packet containing life orientation test-revised (LOT-R), core self-evaluations, and satisfaction with life scale. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted to assess the dimension of LOT-R. Bootstrap was used in structural equation modeling to analyze mediation effect."/>
  <chunk id="bab3e74b5db5b2e04b521d1172b9df7726871aaa.c4" text="Results: Results revealed that dispositional optimism and core self-evaluations were significantly correlated with life satisfaction. CFA identified the bidimensional structure of dispositional optimism. SEM indicated that core self-evaluations partially mediated the effect of dispositional optimism on life satisfaction. The final model also revealed significant paths from optimism and pessimism to life satisfaction through core-self evaluations.">

This study provides valuable evidence on how to promote the life satisfaction of human beings in positive psychology. A further study can fully explore the relationship among them in multi-cultural follow-up studies.">
