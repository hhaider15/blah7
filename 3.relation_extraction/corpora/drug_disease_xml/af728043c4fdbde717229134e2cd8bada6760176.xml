Recently, the outbreak of the epidemic disease has been a serious problem in swine industry. The objective of this study is to develop a rapid, sensitive, and real-time reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) method for the detection of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) in less equipped laboratories. Results: The optimal reaction condition of the current real-time RT-LAMP for PEDV was 62Â°C for 45 min. It was capable of detecting PEDV from clinical samples and differentiating PEDV from several related porcine viruses, while it did not require additional expensive equipment. The minimum detection limit of the real-time RT-LAMP assay was 0.07PFU per reaction for PEDV RNA, making this assay approximately 100-fold more sensitive than that of one-step RT-PCR. By screening a panel of clinical specimens, the results showed that this method presented a similar sensitivity with real-time RT-PCR and was somewhat sensitive than one-step RT-PCR in detection of clinical samples.">
