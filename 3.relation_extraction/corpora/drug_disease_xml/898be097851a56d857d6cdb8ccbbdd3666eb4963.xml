For solving pseudoknot (PK) problems, a method of handles, exit tags and maps has been developed. In addition, many tools are built around these handles and mapping methods. These tools permit a methodology that considers the context of the structure. In total, these techniques permit back editing of structural data and free energy (FE) data.">

Likewise, KineFold is an elaborate local folding model that handles sequential 5' to 3' folding [8, 9] . Notable in these latter two methods is that realistic considerations about the three dimensional (3D) structure of a pseudoknot and polymer dynamics are seriously considered in the models. However, convergence for all these folding algorithms is typically slow and except for Cao et al. (which is 6 N ), not necessarily guaranteed. Other techniques consist of alignment of sequence or structure. One of the earlier systematic approaches employed maximum weight matching (MWM) for sequence alignment including pseudoknots [10]. More recently, dynamic MWM [11] has also been proposed. These can run rather fast, but suffer some loss of accuracy. A hybrid method of loop matching with thermodynamics and sequence alignment known as iterative loop matching (ILM) is a significant extension of the original MWM approach [12]. PSTAG is a structure alignment technique using pair stochastic tree adjoining grammars [13]; an approach that has its origins in studies in language processing [14]. A language processing strategy is potentially powerful [14,15]; however, they are rather costly in time complexity ( 5 N ) and memory ( 4 N ) [13]. A simplified approach that applies only the parsing part of this procedure was also developed with some success [16]. Of these alignment strategies, ILM claims the smallest time complexity ( 4 N ) and memory ( 3 N ). Recently, a hybrid method has been developed that employs other methods to gain a consensus for H-type pseudoknots [17]. The last two groups involve exact thermodynamic models that follow in the tradition of the secondary structure calculations. Of these, the first group finds only the mFE with no suboptimal structures. The most precise model, PKNOTS, that guarantees the minimum free energy is computationally costly in time ( 6 N ) and memory ( 4 N ) [18]. Recently, a simplified approach has been developed that sacrifices some detail by applying canonical rules but only requires a time of 4 N and memory 2 N [19]. Knowledge of the structural features of typical pseudoknots is used in this approach to help in the search and reduce the search space [19]. The final strategy follows in the traditions of partition functions for secondary structure [20] and therefore provides the possibility of suboptimal structure prediction [21].This approach sacrifices some detail and has a costly time complexity ( 6 N ).">

It has scored close to 80% success on secondary structure predictions of a complete genome of tRNA sequences, which approaches the typical success of sequence alignment approaches. However, vsfold4 can only calculate secondary structure, which restricts its utility. The current version, vsfold5, has made the important leap to predicting pseudoknots, and, at the same time, does not add significantly to the overall time complexity of the calculation.">
