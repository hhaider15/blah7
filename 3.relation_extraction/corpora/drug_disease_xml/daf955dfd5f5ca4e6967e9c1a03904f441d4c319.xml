  <chunk id="daf955dfd5f5ca4e6967e9c1a03904f441d4c319.c1" text="Myocarditis can present in many different forms and can be overlooked by more life-threatening conditions. At times it may mimic conditions such as acute myocardial infarction and although it may have features highly suggestive of myocarditis, other etiologies need to be excluded. Thus, due to its clinical presentation, lab findings, and electrocardiogram analysis, it often can be confused with other conditions, making it a diagnostic dilemma of uncertainty. Myopericarditis is normally caused by viral infections, most common of which is coxsackievirus.">
