  <chunk id="50897189565f10bfa3b4884058b5a51cf75c091e.c1" text="Filovirus serological diagnosis and epidemiological investigations are hampered due to the unavailability of validated immunoassays. Diagnostic performance of three indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (I-ELISA) was evaluated for the detection of IgG antibody to Ebola virus (EBOV) in human sera. One I-ELISA was based on a whole EBOV antigen (WAg) and two utilized recombinant nucleocapsid (NP) and glycoproteins (GP), respectively. Validation data sets derived from individual sera collected in South Africa (SA), representing an EBOV non-endemic country, and from sera collected during an Ebola disease (EBOD) outbreak in Sierra Leone (SL), were categorized according to the compounded results of the three I-ELISAs and real time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). At the cut-off values selected at 95% accuracy level by the two-graph receiver operating characteristic analysis, specificity in the SA EBOV negative serum panel (n = 273) ranged from 98.17% (GP ELISA) to 99.27% (WAg ELISA). Diagnostic specificity in the SL EBOV negative panel (n = 676) was 100% by the three ELISAs. The diagnostic sensitivity in 423 RT-PCR confirmed EBOD patients was dependent on the time when the serum was collected after onset of disease. It significantly increased 2 weeks post-onset, reaching 100% sensitivity by WAg and NP and 98.1% by GP I-ELISA. the development of diagnostic assays that can address limited laboratory infrastructure, resources and personnel in affected areas and fulfill requirements for point-of-care (POC) rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), including real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) based on Cepheid GeneXpert technology [15, 16] and antigen detection lateral flow immunoassays [17, 18] . While Ebola virus (EBOV) POC and RDTs molecular and virological methods have been successfully developed and evaluated, serological diagnosis, disease serosurveillance and control programs and monitoring of the immune responses in vaccines remain a challenging subject due to unavailability of validated serological assays. Collection of diagnostic specimens after viral clearance and inappropriate transportation methods and storage conditions may negatively impact molecular assays [19, 20] making serology testing an important tool in the public health response to outbreaks occurring in remote locations where limited resources are available. Serological tests such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) are used for the detection of antibody responses to antigens associated with filovirus infection or vaccination. Establishment of such assays is dependent on the production of high quality immunoreagents [21] . Recombinant antigen technology offers the advantage of development and production under biosafety level two conditions.">

The NPs of filoviruses are highly conserved [23] , and ELISAs based on recombinant EBOV NP antigens have been reported to cross-react with sera from humans and animals infected with different filovirus species [24] [25] [26] . Recombinant NPs are therefore useful for genus-specific screening ELISAs where the specific filovirus species with which a patient is infected is unknown [24, 26] . The glycoprotein (GP) is another ideal antigen for filovirus ELISAs as it contains epitopes known to be targets for filovirus-neutralizing antibody responses [27] . Contrary to the NP, the GP is highly diverse [23] and is useful for ELISAs where the main purpose is to detect species-specific filoviral antibodies.">

  <chunk id="50897189565f10bfa3b4884058b5a51cf75c091e.c3" text="Recombinant protein-based ELISAs for filoviruses were first developed by Prehaud and colleagues in 1998 [28] . The assays made use of either recombinant NP antigens expressed in an Escherichia coli (E. coli) system, or recombinant GP antigens expressed in a baculovirus-Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cell expression system. The antigens reacted positively with sera from previously EBOV-infected human patients [28] . Several other groups have since used and adapted these protein expression techniques for the development of serological assays for EBOV and have reported high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of anti-EBOV IgG [24, [29] [30] [31] . However, recombinant antigens expressed in a bacterial expression system are often problematic due to a lack of molecular folding and post-translational modifications such as glycosylation [32] . Recombinant antigens expressed in baculovirus-insect cell systems prevail over some of the problems presented by those expressed in bacterial expression systems, but the antigenic properties of these antigens may be considerably affected by the differing glycosylation pathways between insect and mammalian cells [33] . To overcome the above-mentioned problems, Nakayama and colleagues [26] developed the first filovirus ELISAs based on recombinant Histidine-tagged GP expressed in human embryonic kidney 293T cells using the mammalian expression vector pCAGGS-MCS [26] . Vu and colleagues developed, optimized, and evaluated a similar ELISA for the quantification of antibodies to EBOV in vaccinated non-human primates, but human samples were unavailable for testing [31] . A field-validated ELISA based on commercially available recombinant EBOV GP has been reported for the detection of immunoglobulin G (IgG) in oral fluid [34] . However, due to the lower sensitivity of oral fluid-based assays compared to serum-based assays, there is a risk of misdiagnosing patients with a low oral concentration of anti-EBOV IgG.">
