1|chunk|In comparison with its economic importance, available genomic information of the olive flounder is very limited. The mass mortality caused by variety of pathogens (virus, bacteria and parasites) is main problem in aquaculture industry, including in olive flounder culture. In this study, we carried out transcriptome analysis using the olive flounder gill tissues after infection of three types of pathogens (Virus; Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus, Bacteria; Streptococcus parauberis, and Parasite; Miamiensis avidus), respectively. As a result, we identified total 12,415 differentially expressed genes (DEG) from viral infection, 1,754 from bacterial infection, and 795 from parasite infection, respectively. To investigate the effects of pathogenic infection on immune response, we analyzed Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis with DEGs and sorted immune-related GO terms per three pathogen groups. Especially, we verified various GO terms, and genes in these terms showed down-regulated expression pattern. In addition, we identified 67 common genes (10 up-regulated and 57 down-regulated) present in three pathogen infection groups. Our goals are to provide plenty of genomic knowledge about olive flounder transcripts for further research and report genes, which were changed in their expression after specific pathogen infection.

2|chunk|Olive flounder is one of main marine species having high economic value in the countries of East Asia. Because of industrial importance by increasing of demand, it is serious subject to understand the pathogenic infection and production performance of olive flounder. Mass mortality of fishes is the most severe problem, accompanying vast deficit in aquaculture farm. Efforts to prevent regrettable death have especially been conducted in immunology 1-3 . However, so far, it is hard to figure out cause of death exactly in short time because of variables of expansive marine ecosystem. Mass mortality of olive flounder was normally caused by diseases via various sources of infection such as virus, bacteria, or parasite from external environment.

3|chunk|Viruses depend on host cell ribosomes to produce their proteins, and sometime use host cell DNA and RNA polymerases for replication and transcription, respectively. Many viruses encode proteins that modify the host transcription or translation apparatus to favor the synthesis of viral proteins over those of the host cell. Among
