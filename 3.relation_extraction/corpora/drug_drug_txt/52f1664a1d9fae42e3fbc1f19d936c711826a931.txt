1|chunk|It has been demonstrated that, in addition to genomic RNA, sgmRNA is able to serve as a template for the synthesis of the negative-strand [()-strand] complement. However, the cis-acting elements on the positive-strand [(+)-strand] sgmRNA required for ()-strand sgmRNA synthesis have not yet been systematically identified. In this study, we employed real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction to analyze the cis-acting elements on bovine coronavirus (BCoV) sgmRNA 7 required for the synthesis of its ()-strand counterpart by deletion mutagenesis. The major findings are as follows.

(2) Deletions of the 3' untranslated region (UTR) bulged stem-loop showed no effect on ()-strand sgmRNA synthesis; however, deletion of the 3' UTR pseudoknot decreased the yield of ()-strand sgmRNA. (3) Nucleotides positioned from 15 to 34 of the sgmRNA 7 3'-terminal region are required for efficient ()-strand sgmRNA synthesis. (4) Nucleotide species at the 3'-most position (1) of sgmRNA 7 is correlated to the efficiency of ()-strand sgmRNA synthesis. These results together suggest, in principle, that the 5'-and 3'-terminal sequences on sgmRNA 7 harbor cis-acting elements are critical for efficient ()-strand sgmRNA synthesis in BCoV.
