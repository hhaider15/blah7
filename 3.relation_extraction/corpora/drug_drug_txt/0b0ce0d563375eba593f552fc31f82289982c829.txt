1|chunk|Background The Binational Border Infectious Disease Surveillance program began surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) on the US-Mexico border in 2009. Here, we describe patients in Southern Arizona.

2|chunk|Methods Patients admitted to five acute care hospitals that met the SARI case definition (temperature 378C or reported fever or chills with history of cough, sore throat, or shortness of breath in a hospitalized person) were enrolled. Staff completed a standard form and collected a nasopharyngeal swab which was tested for selected respiratory viruses by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.

3|chunk|Results From October 2010-September 2014, we enrolled 332 SARI patients. Fifty-two percent were male and 48% were white non-Hispanic. The median age was 63 years (47% 65 years and 52% <5 years). During hospitalization, 51 of 230 (22%) patients required intubation, 120 of 297 (40%) were admitted to intensive care unit, and 28 of 278 (10%) died. Influenza vaccination was 56%. Of 309 cases tested, 49 (16%) were positive for influenza viruses, 25 (81%) for human metapneumovirus, 20 (65%) for parainfluenza viruses, 16 (52%) for coronavirus, 11 (36%) for respiratory syncytial virus, 10 (32%) for rhinovirus, 4 (13%) for rhinovirus/ enterovirus, 3 (10%) for enteroviruses, and 3 (10%) for adenovirus. Among the 49 influenza-positive specimens, 76% were influenza A (19 H3N2, 17 H1N1pdm09, and 1 not subtyped), and 24% were influenza B.

4|chunk|Conclusion Influenza viruses were a frequent cause of SARI in hospitalized patients in Southern Arizona. Monitoring respiratory illness in border populations will help better understand the etiologies. Improving influenza vaccination coverage may help prevent some SARI cases.
