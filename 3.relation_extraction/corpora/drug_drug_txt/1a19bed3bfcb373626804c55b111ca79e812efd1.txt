1|chunk|Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and Newcastle disease virus (NDV) are two poultry pathogens seriously affecting the poultry industry. Here, IBV S1 and the ectodomain of NDV F proteins were separately linked with the trans-membrane and carboxy-terminal domain of IBV S protein (S TMCT ), composing rS and rF; thus, a novel chimeric infectious bronchitis-Newcastle disease (IB-ND) virus-like particles (VLPs) vaccine containing the rS, rF, and IBV M protein was constructed. Under the transmission electron microscope (TEM), VLPs possessing similar morphology to natural IBV were observed. To evaluate the immunogenicity of chimeric IB-ND VLPs, specific pathogen-free (SPF) chickens were immunized with three increasing doses (50, 75, and 100 g protein of VLPs). Results of ELISAs detecting IBV and NDV specific antibodies and IL-4 and IFN- T cell cytokines indicated that vaccination with chimeric IB-ND VLPs could efficiently induce humoral and cellular immune responses. In the challenge study, chimeric IB-ND VLPs (100 g protein) provided 100% protection against IBV or NDV virulent challenge from death, and viral RNA levels in tissues and swabs were greatly reduced. Collectively, chimeric IB-ND VLPs are highly immunogenic and could provide complete protection from an IBV or NDV virulent challenge. Chimeric IB-ND VLPs are an appealing vaccine candidate and a promising vaccine platform bearing multivalent antigens.
