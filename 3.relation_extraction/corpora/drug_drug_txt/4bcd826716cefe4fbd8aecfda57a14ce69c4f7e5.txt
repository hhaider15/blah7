A retrospective cohort design was used to conduct an epidemiological field investigation. Real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR, bacterial culture, and serological identification methods were used for pathogen detection and identification. Result. ere were 7 cases of illness, and the attack rate was 46.67%. e onset date was concentrated on May 9 and 10. All cases were found in the tour group, and no cases occurred in the nontour group. e results of this retrospective cohort study showed that the consumption of boiled eggs for breakfast on May 9 was a common factor (R 2  6.67, P  0.023). Salmonella enteritidis was identified from the patients' stool and vomit. Conclusion. e food poisoning epidemic was caused by Salmonella enteritidis.
