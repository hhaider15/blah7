0|chunk|4. Supporting Information S4 -The signature performance remains robust across different patient subgroups

1|chunk|We demonstrated that the signature remained robust across a wide range of patient characteristics including age, clinical syndrome, time from symptom onset, maximal temperature, pathogen species, comorbidities, and the clinical site with AUCs ranging from 0.87 to 1.0 (Fig. 4) . In this section, we review the performance of the signature across additional patient subgroups.
