1|chunk|The HIV-1 accessory protein Vpu enhances virus release by counteracting the host restriction factor tetherin. To further understand the role of host cell proteins in Vpu function, we carried out yeast twohybrid screening and identified a previously reported Vpu-interacting host factor, small glutaminerich tetratricopeptide repeat-containing protein (SGTA). While RNAi-mediated depletion of SGTA did not significantly affect levels of tetherin or virus release efficiency, we observed that overexpression of SGTA inhibited HIV-1 release in a Vpu-and tetherin-independent manner. Overexpression of SGTA in the presence of Vpu, but not in its absence, resulted in a marked stabilization and cytosolic relocalization of a 23-kDa, non-glycosylated tetherin species. Coimmunoprecipitation studies indicated that non-glycosylated tetherin is stabilized through the formation of a ternary SGTA/Vpu/tetherin complex. This accumulation of non-glycosylated tetherin is due to inhibition of its degradation, independent of the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. Because the SGTA-stabilized tetherin species is partially localized to the cytosol, we propose that overexpression of SGTA in the presence of Vpu blocks the translocation of tetherin across the ER membrane, resulting in cytosolic accumulation of a non-glycosylated tetherin species. Although our results do not provide support for a physiological function of SGTA in HIV-1 replication, they demonstrate that SGTA overexpression regulates tetherin expression and stability, thus providing insights into the function of SGTA in ER translocation and protein degradation.

2|chunk|Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), the causative agent of AIDS, encodes three essential structural polyproteins (Gag, Pol and Env), two regulatory proteins (Tat and Rev), and four accessory proteins (Vif, Vpr, Vpu and Nef) 1 . The vpu gene is present in HIV-1 and certain simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs; SIVgsn, SIVmus, SIVmon) but not in HIV-2 or other SIVs. Vpu is a 16-kDa, type I integral membrane phosphoprotein that is expressed from a bicistronic mRNA together with the Env glycoprotein 2 . Vpu contains an amino-terminal transmembrane (TM) domain and a carboxy-terminal cytoplasmic tail (CT). The CT of Vpu consists of two  -helices linked by a short loop. Two serine residues (S52 and S56) that undergo phosphorylation to recruit  -TrCP, a key component of the SkpI-Cullin-F-box E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, are located in the short loop 3 . Vpu is primarily localized in the ER and Golgi and also to some extent at the plasma membrane 4 .

3|chunk|The two primary functions of Vpu are (i) degradation of CD4, the primary receptor for HIV-1 and other primate lentiviruses 5-7 and (ii) enhancement of the release of newly formed virus particles from the cell surface by inhibiting the activity of the host restriction factor tetherin/BST-2/CD317/HM1.24 (hereafter referred to as tetherin) 8, 9 . The degradation of CD4 involves the interaction of Vpu and CD4 via their cytoplasmic domains, followed by recruitment of  -TrCP to the Vpu-CD4 complex, which leads to ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation of CD4 10 . In this case, Vpu acts as a linker between CD4 and  -TrCP. In contrast, enhancement of virus release involves the TM domain of Vpu to counteract the antiviral activity of tetherin 11 . Vpu also downregulates the expression of major histocompatibility complex class II 12 and tetraspanin proteins 13,14 from the cell surface. It has been reported that Vpu also protects HIV-1-infected cells from antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) through down-regulation of CD4 and tetherin 15 .
