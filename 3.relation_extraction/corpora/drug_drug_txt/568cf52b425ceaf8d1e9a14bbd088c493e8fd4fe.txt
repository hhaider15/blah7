1|chunk|Background: Poliovirus, the causative agent of poliomyelitis, is a human enterovirus and a member of the family of Picornaviridae and among the most rapidly evolving viruses known. Analysis of codon usage can reveal much about the molecular evolution of the viruses. However, little information about synonymous codon usage pattern of polioviruses genome has been acquired to date.

2|chunk|The relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) values, effective number of codon (ENC) values, nucleotide contents and dinucleotides were investigated and a comparative analysis of codon usage pattern for open reading frames (ORFs) among 48 polioviruses isolates including 31 of genotype 1, 13 of genotype 2 and 4 of genotype 3.
