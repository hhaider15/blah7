1|chunk|Ebolaviruses comprises 5 species that exert varying degrees of mortality/infectivity in humans with

2|chunk|showing the highest. However, the molecular basis of this differential mortality/infectivity remains unclear. Here, we report that the structural features of ebolavirus envelope glycoproteins (GPs) and one of their counter receptors, macrophage galactose-type calcium-type lectin (MGL/CD301), play crucial roles in determining viral infectivity. The low infectivity of REBOV mediated by the interaction between GPs and MGL/CD301 dramatically increased when the N-terminal 18 amino acids (33rd through 50th) of GPs were replaced with that of ZEBOV. Furthermore, structural analysis of glycans of GPs revealed that N-glycans were more extended in REBOV than in ZEBOV. N-glycan extension was reversed by the replacement of aforementioned N-terminal 18 amino acid residues. Therefore, these data strongly suggest that extended N-glycans on GPs reduce MGL/CD301-mediated viral infectivity by hindering the interaction between GPs and MGL/CD301 preferentially binds O-glycans.

3|chunk|Involvement of glycan-lectin binding in the initiation of virus-host interactions is widely known, yet the structural basis of the interactions is not fully understood. Lectins on the surfaces of viruses such as influenza virus, and surface glycans such as those present on ebolavirus (EBOV), are supposed to play significant roles. EBOV belongs to the family Filoviridae and causes severe hemorrhagic fevers in humans and nonhuman primates 1-3 . The mechanism of pathogenesis of EBOV infection remains mostly unknown, making it paramount to understand the mechanism of infection, develop effective therapies and solve the biological questions why and how such virulent viral disease gave rise. Since the pathogenesis of EBOV involves inflammation and vascular stability, the glycan-lectin interactions taking place on the surfaces of macrophages and dendritic cells are likely to play crucial roles.

Although it appears that a variety of mechanisms collectively modulate the processes leading to the establishment of infection and pathogenesis 4 , the EBOV envelope glycoproteins (GPs) are known to function as one of the crucial factors that determine the differential virulence.

6|chunk|GPs are type I transmembrane glycoproteins composed of GP1 and GP2. GP1 has a mucin-like motif, highly modified with N-and O-glycans, and GP2 has a transmembrane region tethering the GP1-GP2 complex on the viral surface 2,3 . During the course of infection, GPs are apparently involved in viral attachment and fusion of viral envelope with host membranes, leading to the subsequent entry into cells 2,5,6 . Recent findings that GP-specific neutralizing antibodies and pseudosaccharides, which could be a ligand of lectins expressed on host cell surfaces, were reported to protect experimental animals from lethal EBOV infection also support the notion that GPs function as crucial elements in determining the degree of infection 7-10 . Additionally, the mucin-like domain of ZEBOV GP1 was previously reported to be essential to the infectivity of ZEBOV 11 . C-Type lectins on myeloid and other cells were previously reported to act as entry sites for EBOV through their interaction with GPs [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . As examples, hepatic asialoglycoprotein receptor was reported to interact with N-glycans promoting viral entry into hepatocytes 14 , and dendritic cell-specific ICAM3 (intercellular adhesion molecule 3)-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) and DC-SIGN-related receptor (DC-SIGNR) were shown to bind high mannose-type N-glycans to promote entry into dendritic cells 12, 13, 16, 17 . Endothelial LSECtin (liver and lymph node sinusoidal endothelial cell C-type lectin) recognizes N-glycans and enhances viral infection 15 . We previously showed that K562 cells became susceptible to infection by vesicular stomatitis virus that lacks native G protein (VSVG*, hereafter described as VSV) 5 pseudotyped with EBOV GPs when macrophage galactose-type calcium-type lectin (MGL/CD301) was expressed 18 . Since MGL/CD301 preferentially binds O-glycans, mucin-like domain was thought to play important roles in the interaction.

7|chunk|In the present report, we aimed to answer the question why the lethality/pathogenicity of REBOV is lower than that of ZEBOV. To this end, we prepared pseudotyped viruses and virus-like particles (VLPs) 19,20 with ZEBOV GP (ZGP), REBOV GP (RGP), or chimeric GPs using HEK293T cells and compared these GPs with respect to: (1) their binding to recombinant MGL/CD301, (2) the roles of N-glycans and O-glycans of GPs on the binding to recombinant MGL/CD301, and (3) the structures of N-glycans present on the GPs. Our exhaustive structural analysis demonstrated that RGP's N-glycans are more extended than ZGP's N-glycans. When N-glycans were removed from GPs, the difference in the binding capacity to MGL/CD301 observed between RGP and ZGP diminished. It is likely that preferential binding of MGL/CD301 to O-glycans on GPs is interfered by the presence of extended N-glycans. By preparing chimeric GPs between RGP and ZGP, we found that the structural characteristics of RGP and ZGP were biosynthetically determined by a surprisingly short stretch of amino acid residues irrelevant to major glycosylation sites. Our results clearly showed that this short stretch of amino acid residues of GP controls the extension of N-glycans of the entire GP and, in turn, the degree of viral infectivity by modulating the interaction of GPs with MGL/CD301.
