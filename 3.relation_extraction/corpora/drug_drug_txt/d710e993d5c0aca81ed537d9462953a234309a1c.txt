1|chunk|To date, a number of mannose-specific lectins have been isolated and characterized from seaweeds, especially from red algae. In fact, man-specific seaweed lectins consist of different structural scaffolds harboring a single or a few carbohydrate-binding sites which specifically recognize mannose-containing glycans. Depending on the structural scaffold, man-specific seaweed lectins belong to five distinct structurally-related lectin families, namely (1) the griffithsin lectin family (-prism I scaffold); (2) the Oscillatoria agardhii agglutinin homolog (OAAH) lectin family (-barrel scaffold); (3) the legume lectin-like lectin family (-sandwich scaffold); (4) the Galanthus nivalis agglutinin (GNA)-like lectin family (-prism II scaffold); and, (5) the MFP2-like lectin family (MFP2-like scaffold). Another algal lectin from Ulva pertusa, has been inferred to the methanol dehydrogenase related lectin family, because it displays a rather different GlcNAc-specificity. In spite of these structural discrepancies, all members from the five lectin families share a common ability to specifically recognize man-containing glycans and, especially, high-mannose type glycans. Because of their mannose-binding specificity, these lectins have been used as valuable tools for deciphering and characterizing the complex mannose-containing glycans from the glycocalyx covering both normal and transformed cells, and as diagnostic tools and therapeutic drugs that specifically recognize the altered high-mannose N-glycans occurring at the surface of various cancer cells. In addition to these anti-cancer properties, man-specific seaweed lectins have been widely used as potent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1)-inactivating proteins, due to their capacity to specifically interact with the envelope glycoprotein gp120 and prevent the virion infectivity of HIV-1 towards the host CD4+ T-lymphocyte cells in vitro.

3|chunk|Compared to other plant and animal man-specific lectins, not much attention has been paid to man-specific seaweed lectins, with the exception of griffithsin, a man-specific lectin isolated from the red alga Griffithsia sp.

4|chunk|[3], owing to its outstanding anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) properties. Like other man-specific lectins, griffithsin specifically recognize some of the high-mannose N-glycans exposed at the surface of gp120, thus interfering with the recognition of gp120 by the CD4+ T lymphocytes. In fact, the association of three gp120-gp41 tandems forms the HIV-1-envelope spike, which facilitates HIV-1 entry into cells. The Env spike of HIV-1 consists of a transmembrane trimer of gp41 associated to an extracellular trimer of gp120, offering exposed high-mannose glycans to the CD4 recognition process (see Section 6.1). In addition to griffithsin, other man-specific lectins belonging to different groups of algae including Rhodophyta (red algae), Pheophyceae (brown algae), Xanthophyceae (yellow-green algae), and Chlorophyta (green algae), have been identified and characterized, particularly with respect to their anti-HIV properties [4, 5] . In addition to their affinity for high-mannose glycans, both cloning and structural information have become available for a few seaweed lectins.

5|chunk|The present review presents an exhaustive overview on the structure-function relationships of man-specific lectins from seaweeds, particularly in relation with their potential biomedical applications as anti-HIV and anticancer agents.

6|chunk|Mannose-specific lectins have been identified in almost all the different families of higher plants belonging to monocot and dicot groups [6] . In addition to higher plant lectins, other man-specific lectins were found in lower plant species, algae and mushrooms [7] . To date, however, a still discrete number of alga species were successfully investigated with the aim of identifying and characterizing man-specific lectins, susceptible to be used as relevant biomarkers for HIV gp120 and cancer high-mannose glycoforms. In this respect, red algae or Rhodophyta, appear as the most promising source for man-specific lectins (Table 1) .
