1|chunk|Intracellular pathogenic microorganisms and toxins exploit host cell mechanisms to enter, exert their deleterious effects as well as hijack host nutrition for their development. A potential approach to treat multiple pathogen infections and that should not induce drug resistance is the use of small molecules that target host components. We identified the compound 1-adamantyl (5-bromo-2-methoxybenzyl) amine (ABMA) from a cell-based high throughput screening for its capacity to protect human cells and mice against ricin toxin without toxicity. This compound efficiently protects cells against various toxins and pathogens including viruses, intracellular bacteria and parasite. ABMA provokes Rab7-positive late endosomal compartment accumulation in mammalian cells without affecting other organelles (early endosomes, lysosomes, the Golgi apparatus, the endoplasmic reticulum or the nucleus). As the mechanism of action of ABMA is restricted to host-endosomal compartments, it reduces cell infection by pathogens that depend on this pathway to invade cells. ABMA may represent a novel class of broadspectrum compounds with therapeutic potential against diverse severe infectious diseases.

2|chunk|There is a growing need for broad-spectrum drugs to fight existing and emerging infectious diseases (EID) and to be prepared for potential bioterror attacks with toxins or microorganism 1 . Each new EID crisis reveals our level of unpreparedness that is due to the difficulty to predict which pathogen will emerge and to the impossibility to develop new drugs within a few months. A strategy for broad-spectrum drug discovery is the search for molecules targeting host components indispensible for entry and/or multiplication of many different toxins and Published: xx xx xxxx OPEN www.nature.com/scientificreports/ 2 SCIENTIFIC REPORTS | 7: 15567 |
