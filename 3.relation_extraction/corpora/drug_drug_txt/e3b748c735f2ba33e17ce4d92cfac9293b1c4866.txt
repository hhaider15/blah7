1|chunk|Medical College Hospital between April 2003 to December 2012 were retrospectively analyzed. Using immunohistochemical analyses, CD20+ B cells were counted in the lymphoid follicles, perivascular, interstitial, and peribronchiolar regions of lung tissure. The CD20+ lymphocytes were mainly present in the lymphoid follicles. The number of follicular CD20+ lymphocytes was higher in the fibrosing than cellular NSIP pattern [255.08 (132.92-449.71) vs. 121.33 (63.54-282.88)/0.1 mm 2 , p = 0.017].

2|chunk|After 1 year of therapy, the follicular CD20+ lymphocytes were significantly higher in patients whose forced vital capacity (FVC) worsened as compared to those who improved (p = 0.014). Additionally, follicular CD20+ lymphocytes were negatively correlated with the post-treatment percentage change in FVC (rho = 0.397, p = 0.004). However, follicular CD20+ lymphocytes were not correlated with survival. These results suggested that pulmonary follicular CD20+ lymphocytes were correlated with the fibrosing pattern of NSIP and predicted less clinical improvement after treatment.

3|chunk|Nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) is an interstitial lung disease (ILD) that may be idiopathic or secondary to connective tissue disease, toxins, or numerous other causes. Although its aetiology and clinical course are highly heterogeneous, NSIP is histopathologically characterised by lymphocytic interstitial infiltration with occasional foci of fibroblasts and variable collagen deposition 1 . The precise mechanism of NSIP is unclear, but inflammation appears to be consistently present in the lungs of affected patients 2 . Thus, medical treatments for NSIP are typically based on glucocorticoids with or without cytotoxic agents.

4|chunk|Besides their capacity for antibody secretion, B lymphocytes act as antigen-presenting cells for T lymphocytes, provide additional co-stimulatory signals, and produce diverse inflammatory and regulatory cytokines 3,4 . CD20 is expressed on B cells beginning in the late pre-B-cell stage in the bone marrow and maintained during B-cell differentiation and development in the periphery. The expression of surface CD20 is then down-regulated on antibody-secreting plasmablasts and extinguished on plasma cells 5 . B lymphocytes are associated with a number of inflammatory respiratory diseases such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypersensitivity pneumonitis, sarcoidosis, and lung transplant rejection 4,6 . B lymphocytes also play a role in the Published: xx xx xxxx OPEN www.nature.com/scientificreports/
