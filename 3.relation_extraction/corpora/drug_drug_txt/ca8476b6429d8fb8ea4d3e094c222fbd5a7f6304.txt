1|chunk|Antibodies play a crucial role in host defense against viruses, both by preventing infection and by controlling viral replication. Besides their capacity to neutralize viruses, antibodies also exert their antiviral effects by crystallizable fragment (Fc)-mediated effector mechanisms. This involves a bridge between innate and adaptive immune systems, wherein antibodies form immune complexes that drive numerous innate immune effector functions, including antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, antibody-dependent complement-mediated lysis, and antibody-dependent phagocytosis. Here, we review certain mechanisms that modulate these antibody-mediated effector functions against virally infected cells, such as viral glycoprotein shedding, viral glycoprotein internalization, antibody cooperativity, and antibody glycosylation. These mechanisms can either protect viral replication or enhance infected cell clearance. Here we discuss the importance of these understudied factors in modulating Fc-mediated effector functions.

These antibody-mediated effector functions have been implicated in the protection and control against many viruses, including influenza viruses [13] , Ebola virus (EboV) [14, 15] , and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) [16] .

3|chunk|In the context of HIV-1 infection, the use of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) has been well studied and is currently being evaluated to both prevent and control infection (NCT03571204) [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . These are HIV envelope (Env)-specific antibodies that exhibit high potency and neutralization breadth across different clades of HIV-1. Numerous studies have passively administrated bNAbs in non-human primate models to protect from chimeric simian-human immunodeficiency (SHIV) challenges and control viremia [17, 22, 23] . Interestingly, recent studies have also suggested that beside the neutralization activity of bNAbs, Fc-mediated effector responses, such as ADCC, are important in preventing and controlling viral replication in vivo [24] . Diminishing the FcR binding of bNAbs by introducing leucine-to-alanine substitutions (L234A/L235A or LALA) in their Fc regions significantly reduced the protection from either high-dose or multiple low dose SHIV challenges in rhesus macaques [25, 26] . Similarly, studies using bNAbs with glycine to arginine and leucine to arginine substitutions in their Fc regions (G236R/L328R or GRLR) to diminish Fc-dependent functions reduced both the bNAb capacity to block viral entry and clear HIV-1-infected cells in a humanized mice model [24, 27, 28] . Interestingly, a recent study found that for some bNAbs, such as PGT121, neutralization alone might be sufficient to protect from SHIV-infected cell challenges in rhesus macaques. This conclusion was made by comparing PGT121 and its LALA counterpart, and also by depleting NK cells, both of which had no effect on protection [29] . Despite this study, there are still numerous lines of evidence suggesting the importance of Fc-mediated effector functions in eliminating HIV-1-infected cells [30] . Other studies have shown that ADCC activity of HIV-1-specific antibodies has been positively correlated with slower disease progression [31, 32] . Infected individuals harboring higher titers of ADCC-inducing antibodies were shown to have lower viral titers and higher CD4+ T cell counts [33, 34] . Lastly, antibodies with ADCC activity, in the presence of low plasma IgA Env-specific antibodies, correlated with decreased HIV-1 acquisition in the partially successful HIV-1 RV144 vaccine trial [35] .

4|chunk|Numerous factors govern the magnitude of antibody-mediated effector functions against virally infected cells, and the majority of these are dependent on the ability of immune complex formation and the efficiency with which effector cell are activated. It has been demonstrated that the degree of antibody binding to antigens correlates with ADCC susceptibility, with lack or excess binding disrupting the ability of immune complexes to engage effector functions [36, 37] . However, antigen binding per se does not always trigger ADCC responses [38, 39] , proper engagement and clustering of FcRs is required to activate effector cells [40] . Since the affinity of antibodies for the majority of FcRs, including FcRIIa and FcRIIIa, is low and in the micromolar range, only multivalent antibody-antigen immune complexes can exert enough avidity to cluster and activate them [1, 2, 8, 41] . Similarly, the stoichiometry and the orientation of the antibodies bound to the antigen, which dictate the accessibility of Fc domains to engage FcRs, appear to play an important role [42] . FcR polymorphisms in humans that have greater Fc binding affinity can also influence the occurrence of infection or disease progression of viral infections, including HIV-1 [43, 44] . Overall, the level, specificity, isotype, and subclass of antibodies are characteristics that dictate the balance between Fc-mediated protection and disease progression.

5|chunk|Despite the recent surge in the study of Fc-mediated effector functions in controlling viral infections, there remain some understudied parameters. These include viral glycoprotein shedding that can redirect humoral immune responses from infected to uninfected cells, glycoprotein internalization that can modulate immune complex formation and the ability of different families of antibodies to synergize for effector cell activation, as well as antibody glycosylation. This review summarizes these mechanisms with a focus on HIV-1, while drawing parallels with other viruses. Finally, the consequences of these mechanisms in determining the efficacy of Fc-mediated effector responses and their implication for vaccine design and therapeutics are discussed.
