1|chunk|Background: Cyclooxygenase-2-derived prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2 ), a bioactive eicosanoid, has been implicated in many biological processes including reproduction, inflammation and tumor growth. We previously showed that PGE 2 stimulated lung cancer cell growth and progression through PGE 2 receptor EP2/EP4-mediated kinase signaling pathways. However, the role of PGE 2 in controlling lung airway epithelial cell phenotype remains unknown. We evaluated the effects of c-Jun and 3-phosphoinositede dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) in mediating epithelial cell hyperplasia induced by PGE 2 .

2|chunk|Method: The bronchial epithelial cell lines BEAS-2B and HBEc14-KT were cultured and then treated with PGE 2 . PDK1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) and a PDK1 inhibitor, an antagonist of the PGE 2 receptor subtype EP4 and EP4 siRNA, c-Jun siRNA, and overexpressions of c-Jun and PDK1 have been used to evaluate the effects on cell proliferation.

3|chunk|We demonstrated that PGE 2 increased normal bronchial epithelial cell proliferation through induction of PDK1, an ankyrin repeat-containing Ser/Thr kinase implicated in the induction of apoptosis and the suppression of tumor growth. PDK1 siRNA and a PDK1 inhibitor blocked the effects of PGE 2 on normal cell growth. The PGE 2induced PDK1 expression was blocked by an antagonist of the PGE 2 receptor subtype EP4 and by EP4 siRNA. In addition, we showed that induction of PDK1 by PGE 2 was associated with induction of the transcription factor, c-Jun protein. Silencing of c-Jun using siRNA and point mutations of c-Jun sites in the PDK1 gene promoter resulted in blockade of PDK1 expression and promoter activity induced by PGE 2 . In contrast, overexpression of c-Jun induced PDK1 gene promoter activity and expression followed increased cell proliferation.

4|chunk|Conclusion: PGE 2 increases normal bronchial epithelial cell proliferation through increased PDK1 gene expression that is dependent on EP4 and induction of c-Jun. Therewith, our data suggest a new role of c-Jun and PDK1 in mediating epithelial cell hyperplasia induced by PGE 2 .
