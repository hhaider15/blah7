1|chunk|Some viruses within the Caliciviridae family initiate their replication cycle by attachment to cell surface carbohydrate moieties, histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs), and/or terminal sialic acids (SAs). Although bovine nebovirus (BNeV), one of the enteric caliciviruses, is an important causative agent of acute gastroenteritis in cattle, its attachment factors and possibly other cellular receptors remain unknown. Using a comprehensive series of protein-ligand biochemical assays, we sought to determine whether BNeV recognizes cell surface HBGAs and/or SAs as attachment factors. It was found that BNeV virus-like particles (VLPs) bound to A type/H type 2/Le y HBGAs expressed in the bovine digestive tract and are related to HBGAs expressed in humans and other host species, suggesting a wide spectrum of HBGA recognition by BNeV. BNeV VLPs also bound to a large variety of different bovine and human saliva samples of all ABH and Lewis types, supporting previously obtained results and suggesting a zoonotic potential of BNeV transmission. Removal of 1,2-linked fucose and 1,3/4-linked fucose epitopes of target HBGAs by confirmation-specific enzymes reduced the binding of BNeV VLPs to synthetic HBGAs, bovine and human saliva, cultured cell lines, and bovine small intestine mucosa, further supporting a wide HBGA binding spectrum of BNeV through recognition of 1,2linked fucose and 1,3/4-linked fucose epitopes of targeted HBGAs. However, removal of terminal 2,3and 2,6-linked SAs by their specific enzyme had no inhibitory effects on binding of BNeV VLPs, indicating that BNeV does not use terminal SAs as attachment factors. Further details of the binding specificity of BNeV remain to be explored. IMPORTANCE Enteric caliciviruses such as noroviruses, sapoviruses, and recoviruses are the most important etiological agents of severe acute gastroenteritis in humans and many other mammalian host species. They initiate infection by attachment to cell surface carbohydrate moieties, HBGAs, and/or terminal SAs. However, the attachment factor(s) for BNeV, a recently classified enteric calicivirus genus/type species, remains unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that BNeV VLPs have a wide spectrum of binding to synthetic HBGAs, bovine and human saliva samples, and bovine duodenal sections. We further discovered that 1,2-linked fucose and 1,3/4-linked fucose epitopes are essential for binding of BNeV VLPs. However, BNeV VLPs do not bind to terminal SAs on cell carbohydrates. Continued investigation regarding the proteinaceous receptor(s) will be necessary for better understanding of the tropism, pathogenesis, and host range of this important viral genus.
