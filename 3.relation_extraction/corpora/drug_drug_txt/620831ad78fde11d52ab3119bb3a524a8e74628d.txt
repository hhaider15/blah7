1|chunk|In order to thrive, viruses have evolved to manipulate host cell machinery for their own benefit. One major obstacle faced by pathogens is the immunological synapse.

2|chunk|To enable efficient replication and latency in immune cells, viruses have developed a range of strategies to manipulate cellular processes involved in immunological synapse formation to evade immune detection and control T-cell activation.

3|chunk|In vitro, viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus 1 and human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 utilise structures known as virological synapses to aid transmission of viral particles from cell to cell in a process termed trans-infection. The formation of the virological synapse provides a gateway for virus to be transferred between cells avoiding the extracellular space, preventing antibody neutralisation or recognition by complement.

4|chunk|This review looks at how viruses are able to subvert intracellular signalling to modulate immune function to their advantage and explores the role synapse formation has in viral persistence and cell-to-cell transmission.
