1|chunk|Pearl River Delta (PRD) clades. Molecular clock analysis indicated that they emerged several months before the HP human strains. Collectively, our results suggest that IAV(H7N9) viruses evolve in chickens through antigenic drift to include a signature HP sequence in the HA gene, which highlights challenges in risk assessment and public health management of IAV(H7N9) infections at the human-animal interface.
