1|chunk|Background: Toxoplasmosis causes loss of life, cognitive and motor function, and sight. A vaccine is greatly needed to prevent this disease. The purpose of this study was to use an immmunosense approach to develop a foundation for development of vaccines to protect humans with the HLA-A03 supertype. Three peptides had been identified with high binding scores for HLA-A03 supertypes using bioinformatic algorhythms, high measured binding affinity for HLA-A03 supertype molecules, and ability to elicit IFN- production by human HLA-A03 supertype peripheral blood CD8 + T cells from seropositive but not seronegative persons.

2|chunk|Results: Herein, when these peptides were administered with the universal CD4 + T cell epitope PADRE (AKFVAAWTLKAAA) and formulated as lipopeptides, or administered with GLA-SE either alone, or with Pam 2 Cys added, we found we successfully created preparations that induced IFN- and reduced parasite burden in HLA-A*1101(an HLA-A03 supertype allele) transgenic mice. GLA-SE is a novel emulsified synthetic TLR4 ligand that is known to facilitate development of T Helper 1 cell (TH1) responses. Then, so our peptides would include those expressed in tachyzoites, bradyzoites and sporozoites from both Type I and II parasites, we used our approaches which had identified the initial peptides. We identified additional peptides using bioinformatics, binding affinity assays, and study of responses of HLA-A03 human cells. Lastly, we found that immunization of HLA-A*1101 transgenic mice with all the pooled peptides administered with PADRE, GLA-SE, and Pam 2 Cys is an effective way to elicit IFN- producing CD8 + splenic T cells and protection. Immunizations included the following peptides together: KSFKDILPK (SAG1 224-232 ); AMLTAFFLR (GRA6 164-172 ); RSFKDLLKK (GRA7 134-142 ); STFWPCLLR (SAG2C 13-21 ); SSAYVFSVK( SPA250-258 ); and AVVSLLRLLK(SPA 89-98 ). This immunization elicited robust protection, measured as reduced
