1|chunk|Complex interactions between effector T cells and Foxp3 + regulatory T cells (Treg) contribute to clinical outcomes in cancer, and autoimmune and infectious diseases. Previous work showed that IL-12 reversed Treg-mediated suppression of CD4 + Foxp3 2 T cell (Tconv) proliferation. We and others have also shown that Tregs express T-bet and IFN-c at sites of Th1 inflammation and that IL-12 induces IFN-c production by Tregs in vitro. To investigate whether loss of immunosuppression occurs when IFN-c is expressed by Tregs we treated mouse lymphocyte cultures with IL-12. IFN-c expression did not decrease the ability of Tregs to suppress Tconv proliferation. Rather, IL-12 treatment decreased Treg frequency and Foxp3 levels in Tregs. We further showed that IL-12 increased IL-2R expression on Tconv and CD8 T cells, diminished its expression on Tregs and decreased IL-2 production by Tconv and CD8 T cells. Together, these IL-12 mediated changes favored the outgrowth of non-Tregs. Additionally, we showed that treatment with a second cytokine, IL-27, decreased IL-2 expression without augmenting Tconv and CD8 T cell proliferation. Notably, IL-27 only slightly modified levels of IL-2R on non-Treg T cells. Together, these results show that IL-12 has multiple effects that modify the balance between Tregs and non-Tregs and support an important role for relative levels of IL-2R but not for IFN-c expression in IL-12-mediated reversal of Treg immunosuppression.
