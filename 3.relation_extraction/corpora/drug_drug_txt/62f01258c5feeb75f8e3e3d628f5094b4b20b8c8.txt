1|chunk|The lack of effective therapeutics for Coxsackievirus B 4 (CVB 4 ) infection underscores the importance of finding novel antiviral compounds. Emodin (1,3,8-trihydroxy-6-methylanthraquinone) is one of the natural anthraquinone derivatives obtained from the root and rhizome of Polygonum cuspidatum. In the present study, the possibility of using emodin as a potential antiviral to treat CVB 4 infection was explored in vitro and in mice. Emodin reduced CVB 4 entry and replication on Hep-2 cells in a concentration-and time-dependent manner, with a 50% effective concentration (EC 50 ) of 12.06 M and selectivity index (SI) of 5.08, respectively. The inhibitory effect of emodin for CVB 4 entry and replication was further confirmed by a quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) assay. The results further showed that the mice orally treated with different dosages of emodin displayed a dose dependent increase of survival rate, body weight and prolonged mean time of death (MTD), accompanied by significantly decreased myocardial virus titers and pathologic scores/lesions. Moreover, emodin could inhibit CVB 4 -induced apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. Our results indicated that emodin could be used as potential antiviral in the post-exposure prophylaxis for CVB 4 infection.
