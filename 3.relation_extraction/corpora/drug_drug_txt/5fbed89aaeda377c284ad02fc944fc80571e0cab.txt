1|chunk|Here we report the design, generation and characterization of BiKEs which consist of CD16A binding human antibody domains fused through a flexible linker to an engineered one-domain soluble human CD4. In presence of cells expressing HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins (Envs), these BiKEs activated specifically CD16Aexpressing Jurkat T cells, degranulated NK cells, induced cytokine production and killed Env-expressing cells. They also effectively mediated killing of chronically and acutely HIV-1 infected T cells by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The presumed ability of these CD4-based BiKEs to bind all HIV-1 isolates, their small size and fully human origin, combined with high efficacy suggest their potential for HIV-1 eradication.

2|chunk|HIV-1 continues to be a major public health problem, and new safer and more effective therapies are needed. Therapeutics approved for clinical use have varying degrees of side effects and none can eradicate the HIV-1. Protein therapeutics are typically cell target-specific and relatively safe 1 . Currently, antibody therapeutics are dominant protein therapeutics with more than 50 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) approved for clinical use 2 . However, there are no mAbs approved for therapy against any viral diseases. The humanized mAb Synagis is the only one approved by the FDA against a viral disease, however, it is only for prevention and not for therapy 3 .

3|chunk|The identification of novel potent broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) against HIV-1 during the last several years gave new hopes to the old idea to use antibodies as anti-HIV-1 therapeutics. Attempts to use bnAbs alone or in combination or as components of chimeric antigen receptors (CARs), bispecific T cell engagers (BiTEs) and other bispecific proteins resulted in promising results both in vitro and in vivo 4-8 . A major problem with all known bnAbs is that none of them neutralize all HIV-1 isolates which can result in generation of escape mutants.

4|chunk|All HIV-1 isolates (including those few which can enter cells using only a coreceptor) bind to their primary receptor CD4. Recently, we engineered a soluble one domain CD4 (mD1.22) which can bind and neutralize all tested isolates as a component of a bispecific multivalent protein 9 . Thus, we have hypothesized that a bispecific fusion protein containing mD1.22 fused to an antibody arm that binds to CD16A on NK cells, not only would presumably neutralize all HIV-1 isolates but also could guide and activate natural killer (NK) cells to find and kill HIV-1 infected cells expressing its envelope glycoprotein (Env, gp120-gp41) at their surface. The capability of NK cells to kill target cells specifically by using bispecific antibodies to both CD16 and target cells was demonstrated Published: xx xx xxxx OPEN www.nature.com/scientificreports/ 2 Scientific RepoRts | 7: 9130 | more than 30 years ago 10 . However, it was not until relatively recently when such bispecific molecules called Bispecific Killer cell Engagers (BiKEs) were successfully used against cancer in a clinical trial 11 .

5|chunk|In general, large fusion proteins (150 kDa) do not penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and their diffusion through the lymphoid tissue where HIV-1 mostly replicates is relatively slow. Decreasing the size of the proteins can dramatically increase their effective diffusion coefficients, e.g., decreasing the size from 150 kDa to about 15 kDa can increase the diffusion through normal solid tissue about 100-fold 12 . Therefore, in an attempt to decrease the size of BiKEs we also used antibody domain binders to CD16A which we recently identified and described 13 . We have hypothesized that BiKEs generated by fusing the one domain CD4 through a flexible linker to an antibody domain binder to CD16A would have relatively small size which could allow them to effectively penetrate tissues and guide the NK cells to kill HIV-1 infected cells.

6|chunk|A major component of a BiKE is the antibody that binds to CD16A. Most (but not all, e.g., 14 ) previously reported antibodies (e.g., 15 ) are from animal origin. The animal antibodies can be humanized and some, e.g., from llama 16 , are similar in sequence to human antibodies; however, the probability for immunogenicity when administered in humans is still on average higher than that for fully human antibodies 17 . Therefore, we used two V H antibody domains (Ads) derived from a human library displayed on phage which bind to CD16A with high affinity, are highly specific and allotype independent 13 .

7|chunk|Here, we show that small BiKEs constructed by fusing these Ads to mD1.22 retain the high affinity, specific binding to both CD16A and gp140. Importantly, in the presence of cells expressing Env, these BiKEs activated specifically the CD16A-expressing Jurkat T cells as well as induced the degranulation of NK cells and resulted in killing of the Env-expressing cells. Furthermore, these BiKEs mediated effective killing of HIV-1 infected T cells by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). To our knowledge these are the first human domain-based BiKEs and the first against HIV-1 based on CD4; we found only one other report published as an extended abstract about BiKEs against HIV-1 based on an anti-CD16A llama domain and the VRC01 Fab 18 . The possibility that our CD4-based BiKEs can bind all HIV-1 isolates, their small size and fully human origin, combined with their high-affinity and specific, activating interactions with CD16A resulting in lysis of HIV-1 infected cells suggest that they are promising candidate therapeutics and worth of further evaluation in animal models and potentially in humans for therapy of HIV-1 infections with the final goal of its eradication.

8|chunk|Design and initial characterization of anti-HIV-1 BiKEs. We have previously identified antibody domains (Ads), D6 and E11, which bind with high affinity to human CD16A 13 . We fused them through a flexible linker to an engineered one domain soluble CD4 (mD1.22) which binds with high affinity to gp120 9 (Fig. 1a) . These BiKEs, designated as mbk6 and mbk11, exhibited single homogeneous bands on both reducing and
