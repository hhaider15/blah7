1|chunk|A series of substituted ethyl 1-[(tert-butoxycarbonyl)amino]-2-methyl-5-(1-methyl-1H-indol-3-yl)-4-[(1-methyl-1H-indol-3-yl)carbonyl]-1H-pyrrole-3-carboxylates were prepared in excellent yields (82-98%) by one-pot reactions between -dicarbonyl compounds 12a-e and 1,2-diaza-1,3-diene (DD) 13. Derivatives 10a,c-e, deazaanalogues of the bis-indole alkaloid topsentin, screened by the National Cancer Institute (Bethesda, MD, USA) in the in vitro one dose primary anticancer assay against a panel of about 60 human tumor cell lines, showed no significant activity, with the exception of compound 9e, which showed moderate activity against the HOP-92 cell line of the non small cell lung cancer sub-panel and the SNB-75 cell line of the CNS sub-panel.
