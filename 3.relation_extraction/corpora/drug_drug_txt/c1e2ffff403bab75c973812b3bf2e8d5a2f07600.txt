1|chunk|Illuminating the role of specific gene duplications within the human lineage can provide insights into human-specific adaptations. The so-called human core duplicon gene families have received particular attention in this respect, due to special features, such as expansion along single chromosomes, newly acquired protein domains and signatures of positive selection. Here, we summarize the data available for 10 such families and include some new analyses. A picture emerges that suggests broad functions for these protein families, possibly through modification of core cellular pathways. Still, more dedicated studies are required to elucidate the function of core-duplicons gene families and how they have shaped adaptations and evolution of humans.
