1|chunk|Macrodomain (MD), a highly conserved protein fold present in a subset of plus-strand RNA viruses, binds to and hydrolyzes ADP-ribose (ADPr) from ADPribosylated proteins. ADPr-binding by the alphavirus nonstructural protein 3 (nsP3) MD is necessary for the initiation of virus replication in neural cells, whereas hydrolase activity facilitates replication complex amplification. To determine the importance of these activities for pathogenesis of alphavirus encephalomyelitis, mutations were introduced into the nsP3 MD of Sindbis virus (SINV), and the effects on ADPr binding and hydrolase activities, virus replication, immune responses, and disease were assessed. Elimination of ADPr-binding and hydrolase activities (G32E) severely impaired in vitro replication of SINV in neural cells and in vivo replication in the central nervous systems of 2-week-old mice with reversion to wild type (WT) (G) or selection of a less compromising change (S) during replication. SINVs with decreased binding and hydrolase activities (G32S and G32A) or with hydrolase deficiency combined with better ADPr-binding (Y114A) were less virulent than WT virus. Compared to the WT, the G32S virus replicated less well in both the brain and spinal cord, induced similar innate responses, and caused less severe disease with full recovery of survivors, whereas the Y114A virus replicated well, induced higher expression of interferon-stimulated and NF-B-induced genes, and was cleared more slowly from the spinal cord with persistent paralysis in survivors. Therefore, MD function was important for neural cell replication both in vitro and in vivo and determined the outcome from alphavirus encephalomyelitis in mice. IMPORTANCE Viral encephalomyelitis is an important cause of long-term disability, as well as acute fatal disease. Identifying viral determinants of outcome helps in assessing disease severity and developing new treatments. Mosquito-borne alphaviruses infect neurons and cause fatal disease in mice. The highly conserved macrodomain of nonstructural protein 3 binds and can remove ADP-ribose (ADPr) from ADPribosylated proteins. To determine the importance of these functions for virulence, recombinant mutant viruses were produced. If macrodomain mutations eliminated ADPr-binding or hydrolase activity, viruses did not grow. If the binding and hydrolase activities were impaired, the viruses grew less well than the wild-type virus, induced similar innate responses, and caused less severe disease, and most of the infected mice recovered. If binding was improved, but hydrolase activity was decreased, the virus replicated well and induced greater innate responses than did the WT, but clearance from the nervous system was impaired, and mice remained paralyzed. Therefore, macrodomain function determined the outcome of alphavirus encephalomyelitis. Citation Abraham R, McPherson RL, Dasovich M, Badiee M, Leung AKL, Griffin DE. 2020.

2|chunk|A lphaviruses are icosahedral, enveloped, message-sense RNA viruses that are transmitted by mosquitoes and cause fever, rash, myalgia, arthralgia, and encephalomyelitis (1-4). Determinants of alphavirus virulence are present in both the structural and nonstructural proteins with changes in surface glycoprotein E2 and nonstructural protein 3 (nsP3) most often associated with altered neurovirulence in mice (5-10). E2 changes affect binding and entry into target cells, while the function(s) of nsP3 important for virulence has been more difficult to discern (11, 12) .

3|chunk|Alphavirus nsP3 has three domains: a phosphorylated C-terminal unstructured hypervariable domain, a zinc-binding alphavirus unique domain and an N-terminal macrodomain (MD). The hypervariable domain interacts with multiple cellular proteins important for virus replication (13-18), and the zinc-binding domain has a role in the synthesis of viral RNA (19-22). The highly conserved MD consists of a central beta sheet surrounded by four to six helices, a protein fold that exists in all kingdoms of life, including a few families of plus-strand RNA viruses (23-27). MDs bind ADP-ribose (ADPr) on proteins posttranslationally modified by either monomers or polymers of ADPr, a modification known as ADP-ribosylation. ADP-ribosylation is catalyzed by enzymes of the ADP-ribosyltransferase diphtheria toxin-like family of proteins commonly known as poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) that transfer ADPr from NAD  to specific residues on target proteins (28-34).

4|chunk|MDs are also present in the nonstructural proteins of coronaviruses, hepatitis E virus, and rubella virus (25, 26, 35) , with roles in determining RNA synthesis, replication, and virulence (36-40). Viral MDs are of the Macro D subclass that also has ADPribosylhydrolase activity and therefore can remove ADP-ribosylation from modified proteins (26, (41) (42) (43) (44) (45) . Because several PARPs are regulated by interferon (IFN), have antiviral properties, and are under evolutionary diversifying selection (46-49), it has been postulated that the primary function of viral MDs is to counter the host response to infection by removing ADPr from modified host proteins (50, 51). However, chikungunya virus (CHIKV) with nsP3 MD mutations resulting in little or no hydrolase or binding activity is not viable in either mammalian or insect cells, indicating an important role for the alphavirus MD in virus replication (43). CHIKV with mutations that reduced, but did not eliminate, ADPr-binding or hydrolase activity were viable, but replication in neural cells and virulence for newborn mice were impaired. Further in vitro studies showed that ADPr-binding is necessary for initiation of replication in neural cells, whereas hydrolase activity facilitates the amplification of replication complexes (37). However, the effects on neurovirulence have received limited attention.

5|chunk|To analyze the importance of nsP3 MD function for neurovirulence and the induction of innate and adaptive antiviral immune responses in the CNS, we have introduced similar mutations into the nsP3 MD of the TE strain of SINV, a well-characterized mouse model of alphavirus encephalomyelitis that causes fatal disease in 2-week-old mice (5, (52) (53) (54) . Previous studies have shown that mutation D10A in the ADPr-binding site is not tolerated, while mutation N24A results in viable virus with impaired shutoff of host protein synthesis and decreased virulence (55, 56). In the current studies, multiple SINV MD mutants were characterized biochemically and assessed for replication in neural cells, neurovirulence, and immune responses in the central nervous system (CNS) and showed that ADPr-binding and hydrolase functions of the nsP3 MD differentially affect the outcome of CNS infection.

6|chunk|Development of mutations in the nsP3 MD and characterization of the effects on ADPr-binding and hydrolase activities. Based on information gained from the structure of the alphavirus nsP3 MD (27) and previous mutational analyses of the binding and hydrolase functions of the CHIKV MD (43), we introduced alanine substitutions into highly conserved amino acids in the ADPr-binding site (positions 24 and Abraham et al.

(A) Representative image of results from the PARP10 catalytic domain (PARP10 CD ) demodification assay. PARP10 CD was incubated with 32 P-NAD  to generate 32 P-MARylated PARP10 CD , which was incubated with buffer alone, nsP3 MDs from WT and mutants for 1 h at 37C, followed by analysis by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Changes in the intensity of 32 P-MARylated PARP10 CD in samples containing nsP3 MD from WT and mutants were quantified. (B) Quantitative representation of MAR hydrolase activity of nsP3 MD mutants relative to WT. Assays were performed in triplicate, buffer control was subtracted, and values were normalized to the activity levels of nsP3 MD WT. The data are presented as the percent WT activity values obtained from three independent experiments. Significance was determined by one-way ANOVA with Dunnett's multiple-comparison test. ****, P  0.0001 (WT versus N24A, G32E, TM [G32E/I113R/Y114N], and Y114A).
