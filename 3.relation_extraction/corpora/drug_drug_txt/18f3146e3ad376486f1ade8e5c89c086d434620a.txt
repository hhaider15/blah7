0|chunk|cells Recent Advances in EPAC-Targeted Therapies: A Biophysical Perspective

1|chunk|The universal second messenger cAMP regulates diverse intracellular processes by interacting with ubiquitously expressed proteins, such as Protein Kinase A (PKA) and the Exchange Protein directly Activated by cAMP (EPAC). EPAC is implicated in multiple pathologies, thus several EPAC-specific inhibitors have been identified in recent years. However, the mechanisms and molecular interactions underlying the EPAC inhibition elicited by such compounds are still poorly understood. Additionally, being hydrophobic low molecular weight species, EPAC-specific inhibitors are prone to forming colloidal aggregates, which result in non-specific aggregation-based inhibition (ABI) in aqueous systems. Here, we review from a biophysical perspective the molecular basis of the specific and non-specific interactions of two EPAC antagonists-CE3F4R, a non-competitive inhibitor, and ESI-09, a competitive inhibitor of EPAC. Additionally, we discuss the value of common ABI attenuators (e.g., TX and HSA) to reduce false positives at the expense of introducing false negatives when screening aggregation-prone compounds. We hope this review provides the EPAC community effective criteria to evaluate similar compounds, aiding in the optimization of existing drug leads, and informing the development of the next generation of EPAC-specific inhibitors.

Importantly, in 1998, a new cAMP receptor was discovered after observing cAMP-dependent activation for the small GTPase Rap1, which was independent of PKA [16] . The new cAMP receptor, now known as the exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (EPAC), was then identified through a database screen for putative cAMP-binding domains [16] . There are two isoforms of EPAC (EPAC1 and EPAC2) that serve as guanine exchange factors for Ras-like GTPases, primarily Rap1 and Rap2 [16, 17] . EPAC1 is more broadly expressed, e.g., in the circulatory, excretory, reproductive and digestive systems, whereas EPAC2 is more abundant in the central nervous system (CNS), pancreas and adrenal gland [16, 17] .

3|chunk|EPAC regulates several critical cAMP-related signaling pathways, including cardiac calcium homeostasis, vascular remodeling, tissue homeostasis, regulation of smooth muscle contraction, insulin secretion from pancreatic  cells, integrin-dependent cell adhesion, neuronal excitability and memory consolidation in the hippocampus [8, [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . Thus, EPAC inhibition has been recognized as a promising therapeutic route for a wide spectrum of diseases, including pancreatic cancer [24], breast cancer [25], cardiac hypertrophy [26], vascular inflammation [27], Alzheimer's disease [28], as well as infections, e.g., Coronavirus' [29] and malaria [30] . For further details about the physiological role of EPAC and subsequent disease implications, we refer to excellent reviews, which have been published in recent years [18, [31] [32] [33] .

4|chunk|Given the critical role played by EPAC in multiple pathologies, several EPAC-specific modulators have been screened to target EPAC proteins (vide infra). Despite their wide commercial availability and seemingly ubiquitous use in experimental studies, for several EPAC inhibitors, the molecular basis of their interactions with EPAC and the related mechanism of action are currently not fully understood, thus limiting further improvement on existing inhibitor design, lead optimization and EPAC-targeted drug development.

5|chunk|Another notable impediment in drug discovery and development [34, 35] arises from the hydrophobic nature of the aforementioned EPAC inhibitors, which makes them susceptible to the formation of colloidal aggregates in a hydrophilic environment. These aggregation prone-compounds can modulate specific enzyme-substrate interactions due to non-specific enzyme-aggregate absorption, ultimately modifying enzyme activity due to protein misfolding/unfolding, decrease in free substrate concentration, alteration of effective enzyme-substrate affinity and/or physical separation of the enzyme and substrate [34] [35] [36] . Overall, the phenomenon of non-specific enzyme inhibition is typically referred to as aggregation-prone inhibition (ABI) and is notorious for introducing false positives in drug screens [34, 37] as well as posing several challenges in terms of dosage optimization and drug delivery in physiological systems.

6|chunk|Many of the aforementioned EPAC inhibitors have shown great therapeutic potential in cell-based and in vivo models despite their propensity to form colloidal aggregates [38] [39] [40] [41] . Interestingly, several drug-like small molecules, lead compounds and even marketed drugs show aggregation-prone tendencies, particularly at micromolar concentrations [42] , raising the question of how the specific interactions between enzymes and enzyme-specific inhibitors are affected by the latter's aggregation-prone tendencies. Moreover, it has not been conclusively determined if all ligand-aggregates involved in ABI bind enzymes in the first place. Thus, a comprehensive understanding of the mechanism of ABI as well as the underlying specific enzyme:inhibitor interactions is critical to further optimize EPAC inhibitors.

7|chunk|As ABI is ubiquitous, several strategies have been implemented to counter aggregate formation, mainly exploiting the sensitivity of ligand aggregates to non-ionic detergents and other solubilizing agents [37, 43] . As such, the detergent Triton X100 (TX) and human or bovine serum albumin (HSA or BSA) are commonly used to attenuate false positives associated with ABI in drug screens. However, they introduce the added risk of generating false negatives [34, 44] . Therefore, in addition to understanding the basis of ABI when evaluating the therapeutic potential of EPAC-specific inhibitors (ESIs), if attenuators are used, awareness of the mechanism of ABI attenuation is also crucial to carefully define and consider the false positive vs. false negative balance.
