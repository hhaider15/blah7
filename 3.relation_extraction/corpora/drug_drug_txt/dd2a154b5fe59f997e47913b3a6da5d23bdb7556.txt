1|chunk|The population of hepatitis B combined with a number of metabolic disorders is increasing significantly. Resveratrol (RSV) has been used as a preclinical drug for the treatment of the metabolic disorders. However, the impact of RSV on HBV replication remains unknown. In this study, the HBV-expressing hepatocelluar carcinoma cell line and mouse model created by hydrodynamic injection of viral DNA were used. We found that RSV activates Sirt1, which in turn deacetylates PGC-1 and subsequently increases the transcriptional activity of PPAR, leading to the enhanced HBV transcription and replication in vitro and in vivo. In addition, we found that this pathway is also required for fastinginduced HBV transcription. Taken together, this study identifies that RSV enhances HBV transcription and replication especially acting on the core promoter, which depends on Sirt1-PGC-1-PPAR pathway. We conclude that RSV may exacerbate the progression of hepatitis B and that patients with hepatitis B infection should be cautious taking RSV as a dietary supplement.

2|chunk|Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a small enveloped DNA virus, which has chronically infected more than 350 million people worldwide and caused about 1 million people death per year due to HBV-associated liver pathologies 1 . Current first-line drugs for HBV treatment include interferon  (IFN ) and nucleoside or nucleotide analogues. While these drugs can minimize HBV replication, they are unable to cure hepatitis B. Therefore, protecting HBV patients from recurring of high HBV DNA levels to minimize the liver damages is still one of the most important strategies for managing this infectious disease.

3|chunk|Increasing evidence shows that, as a result of sedentary behaviors and poor dietary choices, more and more people suffer metabolic syndromes 2 . It correlates with an increased risk of diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and stroke 3-6 . HBV patients have also been subjected to the metabolic disorders and, at present, the prevalence of combined metabolic syndrome and chronic HBV infection in the general population is around 0.99-1.74% 7-9 . Although the interaction between chronic hepatitis B and metabolic diseases is controversial, the presence of both chronic HBV infection and metabolic syndrome further increases the risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 10-13 .

4|chunk|Resveratrol (trans-3,5,40-trihydroxystilbene, RSV) is a polyphenol found in a variety of plant species. RSV has been shown to exert beneficial effects across species and various disease models. It prevents or slows down the progression of a variety of illnesses, especially metabolic diseases 14-16 . Recently it has been shown that RSV has impacts on various viral infections via different pathways. For instance, RSV has been shown to antagonize the respiratory syncytial virus infection in the lung via inhibiting the TRIF/TBK1/IRF-3 complex 17 . RSV was also found to be effective in treating influenza virus 18 and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) 19 . RSV has also been shown to synergize with several antiretroviral drugs in the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 20 and herpes simplex viruses (HSV) 21 . In an in vivo study, 25% RSV cream can achieve the same efficacy in the treatment of HSV-1-induced skin lesions on the abraded epidermis of SKH1 mice as 5% acyclovir cream 22 . In addition, RSV has been confirmed to enhance replication of hepatitis C virus, which indicates that RSV was not suitable as an antioxidant therapy for chronic hepatitis C 23 .

5|chunk|However, the effect of RSV on hepatitis B virus remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the role of RSV in regulation of HBV replication. Surprisingly, we found that RSV administration dramatically up-regulated HBV DNA production in HBV-expressing cells and the mouse model via activating the Sirt1-PGC-1 -PPAR pathway.
