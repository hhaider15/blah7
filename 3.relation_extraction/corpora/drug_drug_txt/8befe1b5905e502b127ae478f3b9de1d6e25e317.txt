1|chunk|Enveloped viruses represent a significant category of pathogens that cause serious diseases in animals. These viruses express envelope glycoproteins that are singularly important during the infection of host cells by mediating fusion between the viral envelope and host cell membranes. Despite low homology at protein levels, three classes of viral fusion proteins have, as of yet, been identified based on structural similarities. Their incorporation into viral particles is dependent upon their proper sub-cellular localization after being expressed and folded properly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). However, viral protein expression can cause stress in the ER, and host cells respond to alleviate the ER stress in the form of the unfolded protein response (UPR); the effects of which have been observed to potentiate or inhibit viral infection. One important arm of UPR is to elevate the capacity of the ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD) pathway, which is comprised of host quality control machinery that ensures proper protein folding. In this review, we provide relevant details regarding viral envelope glycoproteins, UPR, ERAD, and their interactions in host cells.

The membrane penetration mechanism differs fundamentally in non-enveloped viruses, but similar strategies are used for their entry [5] . In general, enveloped animal viruses possess greater adaptability than non-enveloped animal viruses, and consequently, cause a number of severe diseases, such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), hemorrhagic fever, hepatitis, encephalitis, and microcephaly.

3|chunk|The fusion between viral envelope and cell membranes is absolutely critical for the entry of enveloped viruses, which is usually triggered by the insertion of a viral envelope glycoprotein's (Env) fusion peptide into the host membrane. The vast majority of viral fusion proteins are type I transmembrane proteins, which have a single transmembrane domain (TMD), with their N-terminus outside cells and C-terminus inside cells. Most viral envelope proteins have been modeled as existing in a less stable pre-fusion state or a stable post-fusion state. Many of these proteins also oligomerize into trimeric fusogenic complexes in their post-fusion states, forming trimeric hairpin structures on the viral envelope.

4|chunk|Based on their structural and mechanistic properties, viral fusion proteins have been classified into three distinct classes [6] . Class I fusion proteins are found in influenza viruses, paramyxoviruses, retroviruses, and filoviruses. These envelope proteins are first expressed as a polypeptide precursor and then cleaved by cellular proteases, yielding a transmembrane protein with an amino-terminal fusion peptide and a surface protein, which are attached either non-covalently or by a disulfide-bond. The core of the class I protein fusogenic domain is predominantly composed of -helices, which contain an N-terminally located fusion peptide. These proteins trimerize and form a central coiled-coil structure with a three--helix bundle in the pre-fusion state, which refolds into a six--helix bundle in the post-fusion state.

5|chunk|Class II fusion proteins are found in flaviviruses, hepaciviruses, alphaviruses, togaviruses, and Rift Valley fever viruses. They depend on a viral chaperone for folding, which is produced from the same polypeptide precursor where they are arrayed in tandem. When the chaperone is cleaved off, the fusion protein gains the fusogenic activity. These fusion proteins are mostly made of -sheets and exist as homo-or hetero-dimers with the fusion peptides buried in internal loops in the pre-fusion state. In the post-fusion state, these proteins undergo self-rearrangement into stable trimeric hairpins, exposing the fusion peptide and resulting in viral and host membrane fusion.

6|chunk|Class III fusion proteins are found in rhabdoviruses, herpesviruses, and baculoviruses. These proteins are directly translated as a single protein from viral mRNA without protease cleavage, and trimerize in both pre-and post-fusion states. Notably, they combine structural signatures found in both classes I and II, which include a central trimeric coiled coil, three domains predominantly made of -sheets, and internal fusion peptides in the pre-fusion state. However, unlike in class I and II fusion proteins, the pre-fusion and post-fusion states are reversible in class III fusion proteins.

7|chunk|In addition to these structural features, viral fusion proteins are subject to N-glycosylation at varying degrees. Although some viral envelope proteins such as the dengue virus (DENV) E protein are glycosylated at relatively low levels [7] , most of the other important human viruses are subject to heavy glycosylation. For example, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Env precursor gp160 has~34 potential N-linked glycosylation sites (PNGSs):~30 in gp120 and~4 in gp41 [8]; influenza hemagglutinin (HA) molecules have 5 to 11 PNGSs depending on subtypes, with the majority of sites residing in the globular head of the molecule [9]; hepatitis C virus (HCV) E1 has 4 PNGSs and E2 has 9 PNGSs [10]; and Ebola virus envelope glycoprotein (GP) has 17 PNGSs (15 in GP1 and 2 in GP2) [11] . HIV-1 Env and HCV E1 and E2 are so heavily glycosylated that~50% of their respective molar masses are derived from N-linked glycans. Most of the critical sites in these viral glycoproteins are conserved during viral evolution, suggesting the important function of glycosylation in viral infections.
