1|chunk|Murine herpesvirus-68 (MHV-68) productively infects mouse lungs, exhibiting a complex pathology characteristic of both acute viral infections and chronic respiratory diseases. We sought to discover proteins differentially expressed in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) from mice infected with MHV-68. Mice were infected intranasally with MHV-68. After nine days, as the lytic phase of infection resolved, differential BAL proteins were identified by two-dimensional (2D) electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. Of 23 unique proteins, acute phase proteins, vitamin A transport, and oxidative stress response factors Pdx6 and EC-SOD (Sod3) were enriched. Correspondingly, iNOS2 was induced in lung tissue by seven days post-infection. Oxidative stress was partly a direct result of MHV-68 infection, as reactive oxygen species (ROS) were induced in cultured murine NIH3T3 fibroblasts and human lung A549 cells infected with MHV-68. Finally, mice infected with a recombinant MHV-68 co-expressing inflammatory cytokine murine interleukin 6 (IL6) showed exacerbated oxidative stress and soluble type I collagen characteristic of tissue recovery. Thus, oxidative stress appears to be a salient feature of MHV-68 pathogenesis, in part caused by lytic replication of the virus and IL6. Proteins and small molecules in lung oxidative stress networks therefore may provide new therapeutic targets to ameliorate respiratory virus infections.

2|chunk|Viruses 2018, 10, 670 2 of 24 idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) might have an infectious viral component to their onset and/or pathogenesis. The gammaherpesviruses Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV/HHV-8) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) have been detected in the lung tissue of patients with IPF and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related lymphocytic interstitial pneumonias [12] [13] [14] . In contrast, a murine gammaherpesvirus is protective in mice challenged with lethal influenza A virus, suggesting immunomodulatory roles for gammaherpesviruses in the pathogenesis of lung infections [14] . Thus, the application of new genomics technologies for understanding respiratory virus infections under isogenic host conditions might yield deeper insight into the pathological changes that occur in virus infection of the mammalian lung, and provide targets for diagnostic biomarkers or therapeutic intervention.

3|chunk|Murine gammaherpesvirus-68 (MHV-68) infects the lungs of wild and laboratory mice, productively infecting type I and II alveolar epithelial cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells (DCs) [15, 16] . MHV-68 exhibits characteristics of both acute and chronic respiratory pathogens. Even though MHV-68 can inhibit type I interferon secretion by DCs [17], the lungs of mice infected by the virus eventually exhibit discernable pathology, including usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) with diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), and infiltration of inflammatory cells [16, 18, 19] . MHV-68 infection induces pro-inflammatory chemokines including MCP-1, MIP-1a, MIP-1b, IP-10 and RANTES [20] in the lung, and interleukin-6 (IL6) and type II interferon (IFN-gamma in the draining (mediastinal) lymph nodes) [21] . Acute infection is resolved and lytic replication of the virus is cleared from the lungs in a CD8+ cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL-) and type I alpha/beta-interferon receptor (IFNAR)-dependent manner [22, 23] . Clearance also requires CD80/CD86 antigen presentation [24] , , and some degree of CD4+ T-cell help reliant on PKC [26] . However, as gammaherpesvirus infection progresses into latency, MHV-68 DNA remains detectable in the lung parenchyma, recapitulating a chronic disease characterized by increased interstitial collagen deposition, immune deregulation, and fibroblast proliferative events similar to those thought to occur early in the development of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). This chronic pathology phenotype is more clearly observed under experimental conditions where the lungs have been insulted prior to infection by an agent that induces pulmonary fibrosis [27] , such as fluorescein isothyocyanate (FITC), or in mice deficient in immune responses, such as interferon gamma receptor-null mice [15] .

4|chunk|The pro-inflammatory cytokine IL6 is thought to be involved in the host response to respiratory infections. IL6 is upregulated in ARDS caused by bacterial pneumonias in human patients [28] , and in LPS-treated human lung cells infected with RSV [29]. While no differences in viral life cycle, cytokine profiles, nor cytotoxic T-cell responses were observed in MHV-68 infection of IL6-deficient mice, IL6 does appear to regulate natural killer (NK) cells responding to MHV-68 infection [30] . Interestingly, KSHV also encodes a viral homologue of IL6 (vIL6) with distinct signaling activity during lytic infection [31, 32] . To study the role of exogenous expression of this cytokine in gammaherpesvirus infection of the lung, we constructed a recombinant MHV-68 virus expressing murine IL6.

5|chunk|Proteomics analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid has emerged as a new approach to understand pathophysiological events occurring in acute, infectious, malignant or chronic obstructive lung diseases, both in human patients and animal models [33, 34] . BAL is a rich source of information about lung cytokine and chemokine responses, inflammatory proteins, and immune cells present or infiltrating into the alveolar lumen. In proteomics studies, proteins isolated from BAL fluid have been typically analyzed by isoelectric focusing followed by two-dimensional electrophoresis (IEF/2DE), or by multidimensional protein identification technology (MudPIT), allowing for the identification of differentially-expressed proteins secreted or released via pathological processes into the alveolar lumen. These studies have begun to add a new dimension into the characterization of human or mouse physiological responses to acute lung injury (ALI) [33] , acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [35, 36] , and diffuse interstitial lung diseases including IPF [37] , COPD [38], and oxidative or toxicological damage to the lung [39, 40] . In animal models of infectious diseases, BAL has revealed lung cytokine and chemokine profiles and immune cell populations in response to virus infections [15, 20, 41] .
