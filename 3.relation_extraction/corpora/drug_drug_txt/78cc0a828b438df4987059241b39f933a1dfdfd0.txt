0|chunk|Sample descriptors linked to metagenomic sequencing data from human and animal enteric samples from Vietnam

1|chunk|there is still limited information on the diversity of viruses co-circulating in humans and animals. Here, we report data obtained from a large field collection of enteric samples taken from humans, pigs, rodents and other mammal hosts in Vietnam between 2012 and 2016. Each of 2100 stool or rectal swab samples was subjected to virally-enriched agnostic metagenomic sequencing; the short read sequence data are accessible from the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA). We link the sequence data to metadata on host type and demography and geographic location, distinguishing hospital patients, members of a cohort identified as a high risk of zoonotic infections (e.g. abattoir workers, rat traders) and animals. these data are suitable for further studies of virus diversity and virus discovery in humans and animals from Vietnam and to identify viruses found in multiple hosts that are potentially zoonotic.

2|chunk|The sample metadata are available in xslx format via Edinburgh DataShare 23 . The metagenomic sequence data are freely available through the ENA via studies PRJEB6505 20 and PRJEB26687 21 (linked under study PRJEB27881 22 ). Data linkage is via ENA sample accession in Column T of the metadata file.

3|chunk|The metadata file contains the following information:

4|chunk|Column A (Batch) -Processing group identifier: samples with the same identifier were processed in the laboratory at approximately the same time. This may be useful information for users wanting to take batch effects into account. Column B (Run) -Illumina HiSeq run identifier: samples with the same identifier were multiplexed and sequenced together at the Sanger Institute. This may be useful information for users wanting to take batch effects into account. Column C (Sample ID) -Unique identifier for each sample and its corresponding sequence data. Column D (Subject ID) -Identifier for each individual study subject (hospital patient, cohort member or animal). Study subjects may have had multiple samples taken, hence this identifier is not unique to a sample. It consists of a study code (04VZ for the hospital study, 05VZ for the cohort study), a location code (10 for Dong Thap hospital, or 75-nn for cohort study sites), and an individual identifier. Column E (Study component) -VIZIONS study component under which the sample was collected.
