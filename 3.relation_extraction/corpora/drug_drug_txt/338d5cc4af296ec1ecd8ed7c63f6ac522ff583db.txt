1|chunk|Ubiquitin and NEDD8 conjugates decrease following infection with Listeria while ISG15 sites increase a-d) SDS-PAGE of liver homogenate from wild type or USP18 C61A/C61A mice either uninfected or infected with 5 x 10 5 Listeria for 72 hours (three mice of each genotype and condition). e) SDS-PAGE of ubiquitin, NEDD8, ISG15 and ACTIN from MEFs (wild type or Isg15 -/-) uninfected or infected with

2|chunk|Listeria for 24 hours f) Pie chart showing the distribution of the quantified GlyGly(K) sites between clusters 1 to 4 and the non-significantly regulated sites after two-way ANOVA test (Respectively cluster 1 to 4: 8%, 15.5%, 5.5%, 25.4% and 45.6% of non-significantly regulated sites). g) Volcano plots showing significantly regulated GlyGly(K) sites after pair-wise t-test. The fold change (in log2) of each GlyGly(K) site is shown on the x-axis, while the statistical significance (-log P value) is shown on the y-axis (FDR=0.05, S=1). From left to right: Listeria infection upregulated 746 sites in wild type animals while 435 sites were downregulated. In Isg15 -/animals Listeria upregulated only 168 sites while 1,137 sites were downregulated. No sites were significantly regulated between uninfected wild type and Isg15 -/mice. Finally, Listeria infection led to 886 upregulated sites in wild type and 54 sites were upregulated in Isg15 -/mice. Raw data are available in the source data file.
