1|chunk|Background: Egg drop syndrome (EDS), caused by the adenovirus "egg drop syndrome virus" (EDSV) causes severe economic losses through reduced egg production in breeder and layer flocks. The diagnosis of EDSV has been done by molecular tools since its complete genome sequence was identified. In order to enhance the capabilities of the realtime fluorescence loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RealAmp) assay, we aimed to apply the method for direct detection of the EDSV without viral DNA extraction. In order to detect the presence of the EDSV DNA, three pairs of primers were designed, from the conserved region of fiber gene of the EDSV. Results: For our assay, test and control samples were directly used in the reaction mixture in 10-fold serial dilution. The target DNA was amplified at 65C, which yield positive results in a relatively short period of 40-45 min. The method reported in this study is highly sensitive as compared to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and showed no sign of cross-reactivity or false positive results. The RealAmp accomplished specific identification of EDSV among a variety of poultry disease viruses. Conclusions: The direct RealAmp can be used to detect the presence of EDSV. As our result showed, the RealAmp method could be suitable for the direct detection of other DNA viruses.
