1|chunk|Phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate 5-kinase (PIKfyve) is a lipid kinase involved in endosome maturation that emerged from a haploid genetic screen as being required for Ebola virus (EBOV) infection. Here we analyzed the effects of apilimod, a PIKfyve inhibitor that was reported to be well tolerated in humans in phase 2 clinical trials, for its effects on entry and infection of EBOV and Marburg virus (MARV). We first found that apilimod blocks infections by EBOV and MARV in Huh 7, Vero E6 and primary human macrophage cells, with notable potency in the macrophages (IC 50 , 10 nM). We next observed that similar doses of apilimod block EBOV-glycoprotein-virus like particle (VLP) entry and transcription-replication competent VLP infection, suggesting that the primary mode of action of apilimod is as an entry inhibitor, preventing release of the viral genome into the cytoplasm to initiate replication. After providing evidence that the anti-EBOV action of apilimod is via PIKfyve, we showed that it blocks trafficking of EBOV VLPs to endolysosomes containing Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1), the intracellular receptor for EBOV. Concurrently apilimod caused VLPs to accumulate in early endosome antigen 1-positive endosomes. We did not detect any effects of apilimod on bulk endosome acidification, on the activity of cathepsins B and L, or on cholesterol export from endolysosomes. Hence by antagonizing PIKfyve, apilimod appears to block EBOV trafficking to its site of fusion and entry into the cytoplasm. Given the drug's observed anti-filoviral activity, relatively unexplored mechanism of entry inhibition, and reported tolerability in humans, we propose that apilimod be further explored as part of a therapeutic regimen to treat filoviral infections. PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | https://doi.The recent outbreak of Ebola virus (EBOV) disease in Western Africa highlights the urgent need to develop therapeutics to help quell this devastating hemorrhagic fever virus, especially in resource-limited areas around the globe. Here we show that apilimod, an investigational drug that was well-tolerated in phase 2 clinical trials for rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, and psoriasis, is a strong inhibitor of both EBOV and Marburgvirus infections in multiple cell types. Further work shows that apilimod blocks the entry of EBOV particles into the host cell cytoplasm and that it does so by blocking the particles from reaching their normal portal of entry, in Niemann-Pick C1-positive endolysosomes. Our findings are consistent with the identity of phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate 5kinase as the molecular target of apilimod, as the kinase and its product phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate are required for the proper maturation of late endocytic organelles. Hence we propose that apilimod be further explored for repositioning as part of a therapeutic regimen to help ameliorate the sequelae of filoviral infections.
