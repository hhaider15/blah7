3|chunk|Define the space of probability distributions on the action space (0  a i  1) [0, 1] as ([0, 1]). A mixed strategy profile  () is a function that maps the state s  {0, 1} n to the space of probability distributions on the actions space, i.e.,  i : {0, 1} n  ([0, 1]). The definition of a mixed MMPE strategy profile  * := { * i : {0, 1} n  [0, 1]} is a distribution on the action space that satisfies the following, for all t = 1, 2, . . . , and i  N ,
