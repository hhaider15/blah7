0|chunk|An evaluation of contaminated complete feed as a vehicle for porcine epidemic diarrhea virus infection of nave pigs following consumption via natural feeding behavior: proof of concept

1|chunk|Background: Since its initial detection in May 2013, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) has spread rapidly throughout the US swine industry. Initially, contaminated feed was proposed as a risk factor for PEDV; however, data were not available to support this theory. Here we provide proof of concept of this risk by describing a novel means for recovering PEDV-contaminated complete feed material from commercial swine sites and conducting an in vivo experiment to prove its infectivity.

2|chunk|Results: For on-farm detection of PEDV RNA in feed, paint rollers were used to collect material from at-risk feed bins from 3 clinically affected breeding herds. This material was tested by PCR and determined to be positive for PEDV-RNA (Ct = 19.50-22.20 range). To test infectivity, this material was pooled (Ct = 20.65) and a Treatment group of 3-week old PEDV-nave piglets were allowed to consume it via natural feeding behavior. For the purpose of a Positive control, piglets were allowed to ingest feed spiked with stock PEDV (Ct = 18.23) while the negative control group received PEDV-free feed. Clinical signs of PEDV infection (vomiting and diarrhea) and viral shedding were observed in both the Positive control and Treatment group' post-consumption with virus and microscopic lesions detected in intestinal samples No evidence of infection was observed in the Negative controls. Conclusions: These data provide proof of concept that contaminated complete feed can serve as a vehicle for PEDV infection of nave pigs using natural feeding behavior.
