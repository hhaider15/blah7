1|chunk|The success rate of pre-hospital endotracheal intubation (ETI) by paramedics is lower than physicians. We aimed to establish a remote robot-assisted intubation system (RRAIS) and expected it to improve success rate of pre-hospital ETI. To test the robot's feasibility, 20 pigs were intubated by direct laryngoscope or the robot system. Intubation time, success rate, airway complications were recorded during the experiment. The animal experiment showed that participants achieved a higher success rate in absolute numbers by the robot system. In summary, we have successfully developed a remote robotassisted intubation system. It is promising for RRAIS to improve the success rate of pre-hospital ETI and change the current rescue model.

2|chunk|Since the Operation Lindbergh was performed in 2001, telecommunication technique, which demonstrated the feasibility of remote operation in this event, has played a significant role in medicine 1 . A model of combining network with medicine has unique features, which goes beyond the obstacle of long distance and enables people to have access to the latest medical resources. As a result, telemedicine, such as remote consultation and telesurgery, have developed fast in the last decade. We can envisage that telemedicine has a wider application value at places inconvenient for people to reach, such as earthquake zones, aircraft carriers, and nuclear polluted areas.

3|chunk|Endotracheal intubation (ETI) is one of the most commonly performed procedures in first aid and surgery. However, some emergency medical technicians (EMTs) who lack qualifications are unable to perform pre-hospital ETI by themselves. Inexperienced EMTs contribute to more unsuccessful pre-hospital intubations 2 . In addition, success rate of pre-hospital intubation differs widely for different manipulators' experience. Intubation success rate of non-physician clinicians is lower than physicians 3 .

4|chunk|In order to solve the problem, we originally designed and established a remote robot-assisted intubation system (RRAIS) to fulfil remote ETI. RRAIS can divert intubation job from front-line EMTs to rear anesthesiologists and other specialists who have qualifications and richer experience. It is possible for medical specialists away from the accident sites to perform ETI in the future.
