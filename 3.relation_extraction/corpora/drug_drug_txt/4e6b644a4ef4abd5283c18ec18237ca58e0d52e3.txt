1|chunk|HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis (TB), and malaria are 3 major global public health threats that undermine development in many resource-poor settings. Recently, the notion that positive selection during epidemics or longer periods of exposure to common infectious diseases may have had a major effect in modifying the constitution of the human genome is being interrogated at a large scale in many populations around the world. is positive selection from infectious diseases increases power to detect associations in genome-wide association studies (GWASs). High-throughput sequencing (HTS) has transformed both the management of infectious diseases and continues to enable large-scale functional characterization of host resistance/susceptibility alleles and loci; a paradigm shift from single candidate gene studies. Application of genome sequencing technologies and genomics has enabled us to interrogate the host-pathogen interface for improving human health. Human populations are constantly locked in evolutionary arms races with pathogens; therefore, identification of common infectious disease-associated genomic variants/markers is important in therapeutic, vaccine development, and screening susceptible individuals in a population. is review describes a range of host-pathogen genomic loci that have been associated with disease susceptibility and resistant patterns in the era of HTS. We further highlight potential opportunities for these genetic markers.
