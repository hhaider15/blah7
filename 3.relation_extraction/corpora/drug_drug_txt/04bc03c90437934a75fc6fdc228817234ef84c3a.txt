1|chunk|FigUre 5 | Emodin also augments the percentages and numbers of CD8 + CD122 + regulatory T cells (Tregs). Draining lymph node (LN) and spleen cells from emodin-or CsA-treated B6 mice transplanted with BALB/c skin were isolated 10 days after transplantation. The percentages and absolute numbers of CD8 + CD122 + Tregs from LNs and spleens of recipient mice were measured via a flow cytometer. Data are shown as means  SD (n = 6-8 mice). One of three separate experiments is shown.
