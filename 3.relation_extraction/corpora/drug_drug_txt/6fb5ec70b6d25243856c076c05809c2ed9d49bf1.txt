The nsp2 PRF signal of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus is distinctive in directing both 2 and 1 PRF and in its requirement for a trans-acting protein factor, the viral replicase subunit nsp1. Here we show that the the trans-activation of frameshifting is carried out by a protein complex composed of nsp1 and a cellular poly(C) binding protein (PCBP). From the results of in vitro translation and electrophoretic mobility shift assays, we demonstrate that a PCBP/nsp1 complex binds to a C-rich sequence downstream of the slippery sequence and here mimics the activity of a structured mRNA stimulator of PRF. This is the first description of a role for a trans-acting cellular protein in PRF. The discovery broadens the repertoire of activities associated with poly(C) binding proteins and prototypes a new class of virus-host interactions.
