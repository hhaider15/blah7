0|chunk|Full-Length Genome Sequence of Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus Strain CH/GX/2015/750A

1|chunk|We report here the complete genome sequence of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) strain CH/GX/2015/750A (750A), which was isolated from a suckling piglet with watery diarrhea in Guangxi, China. The isolate is genetically close to other recent Chinese variant PEDVs and distinct from the classical PEDVs.
