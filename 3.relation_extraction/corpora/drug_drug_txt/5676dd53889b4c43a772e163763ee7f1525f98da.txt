1|chunk|As chemical drugs, separation and quantification of the specific enantiomer from the chiral compounds in herbal medicines are becoming more important. To clarify the chemical characterization of chiral glucosinolates-the antiviral active ingredients of Radix Isatidis, an optimized efficient method of HPLC-UV-CD was developed to simultaneously separate and quantify the four main chiral glucosinolates: progoitrin, epiprogoitrin, and R,S-goitrin. The first step was to determine progoitrin, epiprogoitrin, and R,S-goitrin using HPLC-UV, and then determine the R-goitrin and S-goitrin by coupling with CD detection. Subsequently, through the linear relations between anisotropy factor (g factor) and the percent optical purity of R-goitrin, the contents of R-goitrin and S-goitrin from the R,S-goitrin mixture were calculated separately. Furthermore, the chemical composition features of the four chiral glucosinolates in 37 samples from crude drugs, decoction pieces, and granules of R. Isatidis were conducted. The total content of the four glucosinolates was obviously higher in crude drugs, and the variance character of each glucosinolate contents was different. In summary, the accurate measurement method reported here allows for better control of the internal quality of R. Isatidis and its granules and provides a powerful approach for the analysis of other chiral components in traditional Chinese medicines.

2|chunk|Molecules 2018, 23, 1305 2 of 9 natural products of TCMs are chiral. Here, one isomer possesses a desired therapeutic effect, whereas its paired enantiomer could be inactive or even have undesirable effects [2] . For example, S-ibuprofen, the first chiral drugs of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug approved in 1994, was over a 100-fold more potent as an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase 1 enzyme than R-ibuprofen [3] . Notably, 45 new drugs approved by the US food and Drug Administration in 2015 were single enantiomers, except for lesinurad [4] . For this reason, investigating the biological activities of specific enantiomers of chiral compounds in TCMs is becoming more important. Chiral analysis of the chemical constituents in TCMs is therefore urgent and desired.

3|chunk|Radix Isatidis, the dried roots of Isatis indigotica Fort. (Fam. Brassicaceae), have been used to remove heat and toxins, cool the blood, and clear the throat in oriental countries for thousands of years [5] [6] [7] . Since 1985, it has been recorded in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia and recognized as an important traditional Chinese herb for the prevention and treatment of cold and malignant infectious diseases, especially SARS coronavirus and H1N1 influenza virus [8-10]. R. Isatidis and its granules have been occupying a huge share of the international market in recent decades.

4|chunk|The aqueous extract of R. Isatidis and their chiral glucosinolates, such as epiprogoitrin, progoitrin, and R,S-goitrin, have attracted more attention due to their antiviral activity [11] [12] [13] . In our previous studies, the specific marker of R,S-goitrin has been used for quality evaluation of R. Isatidis and its granules, which has been recorded in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia (2015 Edition) [6, 14, 15] . R-goitrin and S-goitrin were separately transferred from epiprogoitrin and progoitrin via the effect of myrosinase and considered to be the most noteworthy glucosinolate-biotransformed products [16] . The contents of degradation products might be influenced by the procedures of traditional processing and extraction in crude drugs, decoction pieces, and granules of R. Isatidis [17] . Furthermore, the pharmacological properties of R. Isatidis is related to R-goitrin. The inhibitory effect of R-goitrin against influenza viral neuraminidase was revealed by fluorescent enzyme immunoassay method [11, 13] , while S-goitrin is known as an antithyroid factor [18] .

5|chunk|To date, X-ray crystallography, NMR, vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) and enantioselective chromatography have been frequently adopted to determine the chiral components of TCMs [1, 2] . Several enantioselective chromatography such as reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) coupled with the type of ChrialpakIC chiral column [19, 20] and supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) have been used for chiral separation of R,S-goitrin in R. Isatidis [21, 22] . However, these methods were limited owing to the complex operation, high cost, and lack of simultaneous quantification of other chiral glucosinolates. Therefore, it is desired and urgent to establish a more efficient enantioselective method to simultaneously quantify the four glucosinolates, and furthermore resolve Rand S-goitrin for the effective use and quality control of R. Isatidis and its granules.

6|chunk|In the present study, a high-performance liquid chromatography/diode array detector coupled with circular dichroism detection (HPLC-DAD-CD) was adopted to develop a more efficient method for simultaneous separation and quantification of the four chiral glucosinolates-epiprogoitrin, progoitrin, R-goitrin, and S-goitrin-in R. Isatidis. Progoitrin, epiprogoitrin and Rand S-goitrin were simultaneously determined using HPLC-UV, whereas R-goitrin was detected and quantified by coupling with CD detection. Through the linear relations between anisotropy factor (g = A CD /A UV ) and the percent optical purity of R-goitrin, the contents of R-goitrin and S-goitrin in the mixture R,S-goitrin was calculated. Furthermore, glucosinolate profiling of 37 samples from crude drugs, decoction pieces, and granules of R. Isatidis was carried out to clarify their chemical characteristics and to find their content distribution.
