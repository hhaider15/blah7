0|chunk|Complete genome sequence of K14JB01, a novel variant strain of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus in South Korea

1|chunk|A novel variant strain of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) emerged on pig farms in South Korea during late 2013. Genomic DNA isolated from a K14JB01 strain identified in a diarrheal pig showed high sequence similarity to PEDV strains prevailing in the United States in 2013. This is the first study to identify the complete genome sequence of a novel variant PEDV in South Korea.
