1|chunk|H9N2 viruses are the most widespread influenza viruses in poultry in Asia. We evaluated the infection and tropism of human and avian H9 influenza virus in the human respiratory tract using ex vivo respiratory organ culture. H9 viruses infected the upper and lower respiratory tract and the majority of H9 viruses had a decreased ability to release virus from the bronchus rather than the lung. This may be attributed to a weak neuraminidase (NA) cleavage of carbon-6-linked sialic acid (Sia) rather than carbon-3-linked Sia. The modified cleavage of N-acetlylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) and N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) by NA in H9 virus replication was observed by reverse genetics, and recombinant H9N2 viruses with amino acids (38KQ) deleted in the NA stalk, and changing the amino acid at position 431 from Proline-to-Lysine. Using recombinant H9 viruses previously evaluated in the ferret, we found that viruses which replicated well in the ferret did not replicate to the same extent in the human ex vivo cultures. The existing risk assessment models for H9N2 viruses in ferrets may not always have a strong correlation with the replication in the human upper respiratory tract. The inclusion of the human ex vivo cultures would further strengthen the future risk-assessment strategies.

2|chunk|Most influenza viruses are widely established in the waterfowl population. While much attention has been given to the H5N1 and H7N9 subtypes, because of their disease severity in humans, another subtype, H9N2, has widely circulated in poultry in many regions of the world. H9N2 was first detected in turkeys in 1966, shorebirds in 1988, and then in ducks and chickens 1, 2 . It is now the most widespread and prevalent influenza virus in Asia. The government of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region implemented interventions starting from 2001 to control this infection, by executing a mandatory monthly rest day, live quail sale ban, and in the subsequent years a biweekly rest day in the wet markets. Prior to these interventions in live bird market trading, the H9N2 virus isolation rate in Hong Kong's live poultry markets was around 5% of all birds tested increasing to almost 20% in game-birds such as quail 3 . These isolation rates are presumably similar in the greater China region in which H9N2 is regarded as the most prevalent subtype of influenza in chickens (reviewed in ref. 4), where market interventions applied in Hong Kong have not been used. Phylogenetic analysis has shown that the three main lineages (Korean, G1 and Chicken/Beijing/1/94-like) of H9N2 viruses have developed from Ck/Bei and reassorted, with other H9 strains 1 .
