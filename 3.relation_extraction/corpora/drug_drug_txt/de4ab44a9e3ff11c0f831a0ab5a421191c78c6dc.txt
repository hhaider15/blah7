1|chunk|Our study aimed to assess the nationwide trends in the incidence of severe gallstone disease in Taiwan among adults aged 20.

2|chunk|Methods: A retrospective longitudinal study was conducted using Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database collected during 1997-2005. Patients with incident severe gallstone disease (acute cholecystitis, biliary pancreatitis, acute cholangitis) and gallstone-related procedures (elective and non-elective cholecystectomy, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography [ERCP]) that led to hospital admission were identified using ICD-9-CM diagnostic and procedure codes. Annual incidence rates of gallstone-related complications and procedures were calculated and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated assuming a Poisson distribution.

3|chunk|The hospital admission rate for severe gallstone disease increased with advancing age and the age-standardized rate (95% CI) per 1000 population was 0.60 (0.59-0.60) for men and 0.59 (0.59-0.60) for women. Men had a higher rate of acute cholecystitis, probably due to the substantially lower rate of elective cholecystectomy among men than women. For those aged 20-39, hospital admissions for all gallstone-related complications and procedures increased significantly. For those aged 60, incidences of biliary pancreatitis, acute cholangitis, and hospital admission for gallstone receiving ERCP increased significantly without substantial change in the incidence of acute cholecystitis and despite a decreased rate of elective cholecystectomy.

4|chunk|Conclusion: This population-based study found a substantial increase in the rate of admission for severe gallstone disease among those aged 20-39. Concurrently, the incidences of biliary pancreatitis and acute cholangitis have risen among those aged 60.
