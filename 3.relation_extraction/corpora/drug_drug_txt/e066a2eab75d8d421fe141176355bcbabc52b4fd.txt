1|chunk|Limited data is available about the etiology of influenza like illnesses (ILIs) in Qatar.

2|chunk|This study aimed at providing preliminary estimates of influenza and other respiratory infections circulating among adults in Qatar.

3|chunk|We retrospectively collected data of about 44,000 patients who visited Hamad General Hospital clinics, sentinel sites, and all primary healthcare centers in Qatar between 2012 and 2017. All samples were tested for influenza viruses, whereas about 38,000 samples were tested for influenza and a panel of respiratory viruses using Fast Track Diagnostics (FTD) RT-PCR kit.

4|chunk|Among all ILIs cases, 20,278 (46.5%) tested positive for at least one respiratory pathogen. Influenza virus was predominating (22.6%), followed by human rhinoviruses (HRVs) (9.5%), and human coronaviruses (HCoVs) (5%). A detection rate of 2-3% was recorded for mycoplasma pneumonia, adenoviruses, human parainfluenza viruses (HPIVs), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and human metapneumovirus (HMPV). ILIs cases were reported throughout the year, however, influenza, RSV, and HMPV exhibited strong seasonal peaks in the winter, while HRVs circulated more during fall and spring. Elderly (>50 years) had the lowest rates of influenza A (13.9%) and B (4.2%), while presenting the highest rates of RSV (3.4%) and HMPV (3.3%). While males had higher rates of HRVs (11.9%), enteroviruses (1.1%) and MERS CoV (0.2%), females had higher proportions of influenza (26.3%), HPIVs (3.2%) and RSV (3.6%) infections.

5|chunk|This report provides a comprehensive insight about the epidemiology of ILIs among adults in the Qatar, as a representative of Gulf States. These results would help in improvement and optimization of diagnostic procedures, as well as control and prevention of the respiratory infections.

7|chunk|Specimens were collected from patients with an age of 15 years or above and presented with ILI attending Hamad General Hospital clinics, sentinel sites, and all primary healthcare centers in Doha between January 2012 to December 2017. A standardized ILI case definition according to the WHO was strictly followed, which defines ILI as fever 38C and cough or sore throat with onset within the last 10 days [12] . For viral detection, specimens from throat swabs (oropharyngeal), nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs, and nasal aspirate were collected. In addition, sputum samples were collected for follow-up analysis from patients who were identified with confirmed Middle East Respiratory Syndrome virus (MERS CoV) infection. All specimens were collected in viral transport medium, stored at 4C, and sent to the virology laboratory of Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC) for testing.
