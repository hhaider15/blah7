0|chunk|A permanent host shift of rabies virus from Chiroptera to Carnivora associated with recombination OPEN

1|chunk|(RABV) is able to infect almost all mammals and is therefore a useful model for the study of host shift mechanisms. Carnivore RABVs originated from two historical host shifts from bat viruses. To reveal the genetic pathways by which bat RABVs changed their host tropism from bats to carnivores, we investigated the second permanent bat-to-carnivore shift resulting in two carnivore variants, known as raccoon RABV (RRV) and south-central skunk RABV (SCSKV). We found that their glycoprotein (G) genes are the result of recombination between an American bat virus and a carnivore virus. This recombination allowed the bat RABV to acquire the head of the G-protein ectodomain of the carnivore virus. This region is involved in receptor recognition and binding, response to changes in the pH microenvironment, trimerization of G proteins, and cell-to-cell transmission during the viral infection. Therefore, this recombination event may have significantly improved the variant's adaptability to carnivores, altering its host tropism and thus leading to large-scale epidemics in striped skunk and raccoon.

Before the 1970s, rabid raccoons were limited to the southeastern United States 15 . Following the detection of RRV in West Virginia in the 1970s, however, the distribution of rabid raccoons has spread at an alarming rate, becoming an epizootic that affects many thousands of square kilometers in North America 15, 16 . Until 1998, raccoons have had the highest incidence of rabies of all species in the United States 17 . Elucidating the genetic mechanism underlying the second historical permanent host shift may aid in controlling future pandemics of bat RABV and other viruses in terrestrial animals.

3|chunk|RABV has a single, non-segmented negative-strand RNA genome encoding five viral proteins: nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix protein (M), glycoprotein (G), and large protein (L) 18 . Of these, G is inserted into the envelope and is responsible for viral attachment to the host cell surface, receptor binding, and membrane fusion 19 . In addition, G also influences viral pathogenicity and neurotropism 20 , inducing the production of virus-neutralizing antibodies 21 . Thus, the G protein clearly plays a key role in determining RABV infection and adaptation to the host. In this study, we dissected the phylogenetic history of the G genes of SCSKV and RRV and found that they are recombinants stemming from the same recombination events. The key genetic component responsible for receptor binding in RRV and SCSKV derives from a carnivore RABV, while the remaining half of the gene derives from a bat RABV. Therefore, the homologous recombination (HR) event appears to have allowed the bat RABV to rapidly adapt to a carnivore host, initiating an epidemic among the carnivores of North America.

4|chunk|Viruses and sequences. In order to ensure the authenticity of the data, sequences of RRV and SCSKV G genes were collected from several previous reports (n = 148, see Additional File 1) 11, 15, 22-24 and from reference RABVs from GenBank (n = 450, see Additional File 2) including global RABV lineages. These were aligned using CLUSTALX v1.81 25 . Xia's test was performed to measure substitution saturation of the sequence alignment 26 . The alignment files for the recombination analysis are available upon request.
