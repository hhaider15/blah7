1|chunk|Canine influenza virus (CIV) subtype H3N2 is a newly identified, highly contagious respiratory pathogen that causes cough, pneumonia and other respiratory symptoms in dogs. Data indicate that the virus is responsible for recent clinical cases of dog disease in China. However, therapeutic options for this disease are very limited. In this study, seven monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against CIV JS/10 (an H3N2 subtype virus) were produced and characterized. Among them, mAb D7, which is specific for the HA2 glycopeptide (gp), induced the highest neutralization titers. The protection provided by mAb D7 was evaluated in BALB/c mice challenged with homologous or heterologous strains of H3N2 influenza virus, including two strains of CIV and one strain of swine influenza virus (SIV). The data show that mAb D7 protected the mice from infection with the three viral strains, especially the homologous strain, which was indicated by the recovery of body weight, reduction of viral load, and reduction of tissue damage. Moreover, the levels of IFN- and TNF- in the lungs, as detected by ELISA, were reduced in the infected mice treated with the mAb D7 compared with those without mAb D7 treatment. Thus, our findings demonstrate, for the first time, that a mAb could reduce the release of IFN- and TNF- associated with tissue damage by CIV infection and that the mAb might be of great therapeutic value for CIV infection.
