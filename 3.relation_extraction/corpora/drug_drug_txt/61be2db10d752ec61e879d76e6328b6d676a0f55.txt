1|chunk|FigURe 1 | TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) in humoral responses. TBK1 functions downstream of TLR3/4-TRIF and DNA receptor cGAS-STING pathways leading to the activation of the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 3 and the production of interferons (IFN-Is). Chronic IFN-Is prime cytotoxic functions promote the survival of NK and CD8 + T cells, presumed to have pathogenic roles in autoimmunity, as well as the formation of extrafollicular plasmablasts. TBK1 is also implicated in the inducible T cell co-stimulator (ICOS) signaling pathway in T follicular B helper (TFH) cells to thymus-dependent (TD) antigens. TBK1 is recruited to and activated upon ICOS engagement to ICOS ligand, and promotes the maturation of pre-TFH to germinal center (GC) TFH cells. TBK1 targets downstream of ICOS signaling remain to be determined. TBK1-driven ICOS signaling is necessary for the generation of GC-derived memory B and plasma cells, and TD antibody responses. Finally, TBK1 can promote autophagy through the phosphorylation of autophagy receptors proteins (optineurin, p62, or NDP52), which sequester ubiquitinated cargo (damaged or redundant organelles). Mitophagy in memory B cells and reticulophagy in plasma cells are required for their longevity in vivo. TBK1 involvement in these processes remains to be determined.
