1|chunk|Library design can be guided by information regarding each position's mutational tolerance and naturally evolved sequence to reduce the prevalence of overly destabilizing mutations as well as identifying structurally stabilizing mutations. Additionally, the chemical diversity found at the interfaces of well characterized natural binders, such as the complementarity determining regions (CDR) of antibodies, can be applied to protein scaffolds to accommodate for strong binding interactions. Here, a model for library design was built based on a linear combination of (A) computational stability, (B) natural homolog sequence frequency, and (C) CDR diversity input matrices. These three elements were weighted based on the (D) target exposure (i.e. proximity to the binding interface) and solvent exposed surface area (i.e. orientation and packing) of each site. !
