1|chunk|Lassa mammarenavirus (LASV) is an enveloped RNA virus that can cause Lassa fever, an acute hemorrhagic fever syndrome associated with significant morbidity and high rates of fatality in endemic regions of western Africa. The arenavirus matrix protein Z has several functions during the virus life cycle, including coordinating viral assembly, driving the release of new virus particles, regulating viral polymerase activity, and antagonizing the host antiviral response. There is limited knowledge regarding how the various functions of Z are regulated. To investigate possible means of regulation, mass spectrometry was used to identify potential sites of phosphorylation in the LASV Z protein. This analysis revealed that two serines (S18, S98) and one tyrosine (Y97) are phosphorylated in the flexible N-and C-terminal regions of the protein. Notably, two of these sites, Y97 and S98, are located in (Y97) or directly adjacent to (S98) the PPXY late domain, an important motif for virus release. Studies with non-phosphorylatable and phosphomimetic Z proteins revealed that these sites are important regulators of the release of LASV particles and that host-driven, reversible phosphorylation may play an important role in the regulation of LASV Z protein function.

2|chunk|Pathogens 2018, 7, 97 2 of 14 2008, outbreaks in Sierra Leone have resulted in an overall case fatality rate of 69% in hospitalized patients [12] . LASV infection results in fetal loss in most cases [13] . Further, pregnancy greatly increases the risk of fatality from Lassa fever for the mother [13] . Of Lassa fever survivors who were hospitalized, approximately one-third developed hearing loss, and in two-thirds of those patients, the hearing deficit was permanent [14] . Intravenous ribavirin treatment has been shown to reduce mortality from Lassa fever, particularly if administered during the first six days of fever onset, but there is a clear need for more effective therapies [5] . No United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved vaccines exist for the prevention of LASV infection.

3|chunk|Arenaviruses have a simple, negative-strand RNA genome that encodes a total of four proteins on two segments. The small (S) segment encodes both the nucleoprotein (NP), which encapsidates the viral genome and is required for its replication, and the envelope glycoprotein (GP), which interacts with cell surface receptors to mediate cell entry and membrane fusion [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . The large (L) genome segment encodes the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L), which replicates and transcribes the genome, and the viral matrix protein (Z) [19] [20] [21] [22] . The Z protein is a structural component of the virion, forming a matrix layer on the inner leaflet of the viral envelope, and carries out an array of important functions during viral propagation [23, 24] . The Z protein of pathogenic arenaviruses antagonizes interferon production by binding to retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) to disrupt interactions between RIG-I-like receptors and mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) [25] . Z can inhibit the translation of capped cellular mRNAs and also regulate the activity of the viral polymerase [26] [27] [28] . Z is also an important coordinator of virus particle assembly by interacting with each of the other three viral proteins [29, 30] .

4|chunk|In addition to these functions, the Z protein is both necessary and sufficient for driving the efficient release of nascent virus particles [23, 31, 32] . However, minimal levels of virus can be recovered without Z [33] . Two major motifs in the Z protein mediate the efficient release of virus particles. First, a myristoylation modification of the second residue in Z, a glycine, mediates Z's interaction with cellular membranes, a requirement for efficient release [34, 35] . Second, all arenavirus Z proteins, with the exception of the Tacaribe virus Z protein, contain one or two proline-rich, late domains near the C-terminus [23, 32] . These viral late domains are presumably responsible for recruiting the cellular endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) pathway to mediate membrane scission, which is the final step in the virus budding process [36] . New World arenavirus Z proteins contain a P(S/T)AP-type late domain, which can bind the ESCRT-I protein Tsg101, while the Old World Z proteins of the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) and Dandenong virus contain only a PPXY late domain, which can bind Nedd4-family E3 ubiquitin ligases [23, 24, 32, 37] . Additionally, the Z proteins of several Old World arenaviruses, including Lassa, Mobala, Mopeia, and Ippy viruses, encode both the PPXY and the P(S/T)AP late domains [23, 24, 32] . In the case of LASV, decreased virus-like particle (VLP) release occurs following mutation of either of LASV Z's PTAP and PPXY late domains, disruption of Z's recruitment of Nedd4-family proteins, and/or loss of specific ESCRT components [23, 24, 32, [37] [38] [39] . The release of VLPs for the related Old World arenavirus LCMV is similarly impacted by PPXY late domain or ESCRT component disruption [32] . However, recent work from our lab demonstrated that in a whole virus system, the sole late domain in the LCMV Z protein and the ESCRT pathway it recruits were specifically required for the production of defective interfering particles but not of infectious virus [40] . This illustrates the complexity and diversity in arenavirus release and highlights the need for a greater understanding of the factors involved in this process.

5|chunk|Protein phosphorylation is a reversible post-translational modification that can regulate the activity of enzymes, mediate protein-protein interactions, alter the subcellular localization, conformation, and/or oligomeric state of proteins, as well as regulate the addition or removal of other types of post-translation modifications [41] . This important type of modification is not limited to cellular proteins; a growing body of literature has demonstrated that phosphorylation of viral proteins has important consequences for different viral processes [42] [43] [44] [45] .
