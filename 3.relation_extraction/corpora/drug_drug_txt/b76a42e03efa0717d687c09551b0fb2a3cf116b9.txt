1|chunk|respiratory samples from 520 patients were analyzed for the presence of HMPV by real-time RT-PCR. Molecular and phylogenetic analyses were performed on partial fusion gene sequences of HMPV-positive patients. Results. HMPV-positive patients were detected in 2007-2008. The overall infection rate was 4%, while 57% of the patients were children. Sequence analysis demonstrated circulation of subgroup B viruses with predominance of lineage B2. Nucleotide sequence identity within lineage B1 was 98.8%-99.7% and higher than that in lineage B2 (94.3%-100%). Three new amino acid substitutions (T223N, R229K, and D280N) of lineage B2 were observed. Conclusion. HMPV is a major viral pathogen in the Egyptian population especially in children.

2|chunk|There is a high seroprevalence of HMPV in sera of adults older than 40 years old, suggesting that it is a newly recognized rather than a newly emerging virus [10, [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] .

3|chunk|Clinical symptoms caused by HMPV infection are similar to those of RSV and include fever, cough, wheezing, dyspnea, rhinorrhea, expectoration, and asthma [18] [19] [20] . Several studies have demonstrated that HMPV accounts for a high proportion of hospitalization for lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) in infants, young children, and other highrisk populations, such as immunocompromised patients [14, [21] [22] [23] . Rates of HMPV infection range from 5.5% to 25% among children hospitalized with respiratory illness [24] [25] [26] .

4|chunk|The clinical manifestations of HMPV infection in adults depend on age and health conditions [2] . In young adults (aged 14-25 years), the clinical symptoms of HMPV infection are similar to those of other respiratory viral infections which include cough, rhinorrhea, and expectoration. In contrast, in middle aged (aged 26-65 years) and healthy elderly adults (aged > 65 years), HMPV is similar to influenza infections and common colds [2] . Although the incidence of HMPV infection in healthy adults during winter is generally less than 6% [27] [28] [29] , HMPV is considered to be a major contributor to the burden of respiratory illnesses in older adults [29] .

5|chunk|Phylogenetic analysis of HMPV has identified two subgroups, A and B. Both can be subdivided into their genetic lineages A1 and A2 and B1 and B2, respectively. All virus variants were identified in various countries in the Americas, Asia, and Europe [8, 30, 31] .

6|chunk|Although reports have confirmed the prevalence of HMPV worldwide, data from North Africa and the Middle East remain limited. For the first time, the present study combines epidemiological data on HMPV prevalence and molecular, phylogenetic analyses of Egyptian HMPV.
