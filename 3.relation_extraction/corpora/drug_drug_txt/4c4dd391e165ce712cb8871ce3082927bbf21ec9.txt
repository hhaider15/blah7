1|chunk|Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the most common infectious cause of mental disability in newborns in developed countries. There is an urgent need to establish an early detection and high-throughput screening method for CMV infection using portable detection devices.

2|chunk|An antibody analysis method is reported for the detection and identification of CMV antibodies in serum using a biosensor based on high spatial resolution imaging ellipsometry (BIE). CMV antigen (CMV-3A) was immobilized on silicon wafers and used to capture CMV antibodies in serum. An antibody against human immunoglobulin G (anti-IgG) was used to confirm the IgG antibody against CMV captured by the CMV-3A.

3|chunk|Our results show that this assay is rapid and specific for the identification of IgG antibody against CMV. Further, patient serum was quantitatively assessed using the standard curve method, and the quantitative results were in agreement with the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The CMV antibody detection sensitivity of BIE reached 0.01 IU/mL.

4|chunk|This novel biosensor may be a valuable diagnostic tool for analysis of IgG antibody against CMV during CMV infection screening.
