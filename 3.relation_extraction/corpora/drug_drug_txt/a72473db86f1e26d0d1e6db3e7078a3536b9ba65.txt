1|chunk|Zika virus (ZIKV) infection is currently one of the major concerns in human public health due to its association with neurological disorders. Intensive effort has been implemented for the treatment of ZIKV, however there are not currently approved vaccines or antivirals available to combat ZIKV infection. In this sense, the identification of virulence factors associated with changes in ZIKV virulence could help to develop safe and effective countermeasures to treat ZIKV or to prevent future outbreaks. Here, we have compared the virulence of two related ZIKV strains from the recent outbreak in Brazil (2015), Rio Grande do Norte Natal (RGN) and Paraiba. In spite of both viruses being identified in the same period of time and region, significant differences in virulence and replication were observed using a validated mouse model of ZIKV infection. While ZIKV-RGN has a 50% mouse lethal dose (MLD 50 ) of ~10 5 focus forming units (FFUs), ZIKV-Paraiba infection resulted in 100% of lethality with less than 10 FFUs. Combining deep-sequencing analysis and our previously described infectious ZIKV-RGN cDNA clone, we identified a natural polymorphism in the non-structural protein 2 A (NS2A) that increase the virulence of ZIKV. Moreover, results demonstrate that the single amino acid alanine to valine substitution at position 117 (A117V) in the NS2A was sufficient to convert the attenuated rZIKV-RGN in a virulent Paraiba-like virus (MLD 50 < 10 FFU). The mechanism of action was also evaluated and data indicate that substitution A117V in ZIKV NS2A protein reduces host innate immune responses and viralinduced apoptosis in vitro. Therefore, amino acid substitution A117V in ZIKV NS2A could be used as a genetic risk-assessment marker for future ZIKV outbreaks.

2|chunk|Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging mosquito-borne flavivirus, which became a global public concern due to its association with an increase in congenital microcephaly cases in Brazil in 2015 1 . ZIKV was first isolated in 1947 from a sentinel rhesus monkey in the Zika forest of Uganda 2 . ZIKV infection in humans was first described during a jaundice epidemic in Nigeria in 1954 3 and only sporadic cases of ZIKV infection in humans have been reported in Africa and Asia over the last century 4-8 . It was not until 2007, when ZIKV caused the first outbreak on Yap Island in the Federated States of Micronesia with almost 75% of the population showing signs of infection 9 .

3|chunk|ZIKV was historically associated with a mild febrile illness, which is similar to that caused by other mosquito-borne diseases of public relevance such as Dengue virus (DENV), Yellow fever virus (YFV) or Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) 10 . The similarity of the clinical signs of ZIKV disease with those of DENV or CHIKV has interfered with ZIKV diagnosis and most probably underestimated the number of cases of ZIKV infections 11 . However, ZIKV has become a major human health concern due to its association with severe neurological complications, including an increased risk of Guillain-Barr syndrome in adults during the large outbreak in French Polynesia in 2013-2014 12,13 and a dramatic increase in severe congenital malformations, including fetal microcephaly in neonates during the massive epidemic that emerged in Brazil in 2015 [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . Since then, millions of infected individuals have been reported in South and Central America, the Caribbean and the South of United States 20-22 . ZIKV is primarily transmitted through the bite of an infected Aedes spp. mosquito (Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus) 6,23-25 . However, non-vector ZIKV transmission has been reported to occur by vertical transmission from mother to child 14, 26, 27 and by sexual transmission 25,28-30 . In addition, ZIKV RNA has been detected in body fluids including blood, urine, semen, saliva and breast milk, increasing the risk of a human to human transmission via direct contact with body fluids from infected people 31,32 .

4|chunk|ZIKV is a positive single-stranded RNA virus with a genome of about 10.8 kb that contains a cap structure at the 5-end and a single open reading frame (ORF) flanked by two 5 and 3 untranslated regions (UTRs) 33,34 . The ORF encodes a single polyprotein of approximately 3,424 amino acids that is co-and post-translationally processed by viral and cellular proteases to produce three structural proteins, capsid (C), pre-membrane (prM) and envelope (E), and seven non-structural (NS) proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B and NS5) 33,34 . Phylogenetic analyses of ZIKV genomes have identified two major genetic lineages, African and Asian 35 . ZIKV strains from the recent epidemic in the Americas are phylogenetically related to the Asian lineage 36,37 . The molecular determinants of ZIKV evolution, spread, virulence, and disease have not been totally established. It has been postulated that ZIKV genome changes may have evolved to modify tissue tropism, becoming more neurotrophic 8,38-41 , and/or more efficiently transmitted to humans 8,32,42-44 , but the virulence factors associated with ZIKV pathogenesis remain unknown.

5|chunk|During the last years, extensive efforts have been made to develop in vitro and in vivo approaches to study ZIKV infection and pathogenesis, including reverse genetic systems 34 and suitable animal models of infection 45 . In this sense, the emergence of ZIKV has promoted the rapid development of numerous reverse genetic approaches 34 , which constitute an essential tool for research to generate recombinant viruses containing specific substitutions to evaluate their contribution in viral replication or transcription, pathogenicity, virus-host interaction, viral tropism and transmissibility [46] [47] [48] . Recently, we have developed a reverse genetic approach based on the use of a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) to assemble the full-length cDNA of the viral genome of ZIKV Rio Grande do Norte Natal (RGN) strain (Brazil, 2015) 49 . On the other hand, animal models are essential to understand the biology and pathogenesis of ZIKV. It is known that infection of immunocompetent mice results in little to no virus production, and infected mice do not develop disease 50 . However, mice with deficiencies in the interferon (IFN) signaling pathway display enhanced susceptibility to infection by ZIKV and other flaviviruses, and they recapitulate many of the symptoms associated with infections in humans 45,51-54 . Therefore, these animal models are currently used to study ZIKV infection in vivo, including the development of new therapeutic approaches to combat and/or prevent ZIKV infections 24, 45, 50, 52, 55 .

6|chunk|In the present study, we have analyzed the virulence of ZIKV-RGN and Paraiba, two viral strains that have been identified from the recent outbreak in Brazil in 2015. Using the validated type-I IFN receptor deficient (IFNAR/) A129 mice model of ZIKV infection, we have observed that ZIKV-Paraiba is more virulent and replicates to higher levels compared to rZIKV-RGN. Combining deep-sequencing analysis and reverse genetic systems, we have identified a single amino acid polymorphism at position 117 in the viral protein NS2A responsible for the differences in virulence between both ZIKV strains. This polymorphism (A117V) in ZIKV NS2A affects host innate immune responses and viral-induced apoptosis, and, therefore, represents an important viral genetic marker for risk-assessment to prevent future ZIKV outbreaks.
