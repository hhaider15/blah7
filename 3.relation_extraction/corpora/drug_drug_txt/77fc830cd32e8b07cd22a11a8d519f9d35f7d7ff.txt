1|chunk|Genomic tools, including phylogenetic trees derived from sequence data, are increasingly used to understand outbreaks of infectious diseases. One challenge is to link phylogenetic trees to patterns of transmission. Particularly in bacteria that cause chronic infections, this inference is affected by variable infectious periods and infectivity over time. It is known that non-exponential infectious periods can have substantial effects on pathogens' transmission dynamics. Here we ask how this non-Markovian nature of an outbreak process affects the branching trees describing that process, with particular focus on tree shapes. We simulate Crump-Mode-Jagers branching processes and compare different patterns of infectivity over time. We find that memory (non-Markovian-ness) in the process can have a pronounced effect on the shapes of the outbreak's branching pattern. However, memory also has a pronounced effect on the sizes of the trees, even when the duration of the simulation is fixed. When the sizes of the trees are constrained to a constant value, memory in our processes has little direct effect on tree shapes, but can bias inference of the birth rate from trees. We compare simulated branching trees to phylogenetic trees from an outbreak of tuberculosis in Canada, and discuss the relevance of memory to this dataset.

2|chunk|Understanding outbreaks of an infectious disease is important for understanding how a pathogen spreads, and in determining the best steps to take to control it. Recently, the advent of next-generation sequencing has permitted the use of genomic data to assist in understanding outbreaks. Even small amounts of genetic variation within an outbreak can potentially be detected with whole-genome sequencing, and used to aid in reconstructing who infected whom 1-8 . Genomic data are typically analysed by inferring phylogenetic trees (phylogenies), namely trees in which the tips correspond to pathogen isolates from infected cases, and the internal nodes correspond to inferred ancestors. Phylogenies are usually rooted, binary trees. An ongoing challenge in epidemiology is to make the best use of genomic data, usually with the help of inference and analysis of phylogenetic trees that carry information on parameters including the basic reproduction number (R 0 ) 9,10 .

3|chunk|Phylogenetic trees are related to branching trees. In a branching process without multifurcations (ie where there is a positive time interval between successive branching events), the process defines a bifurcating tree moving forward in time; internal branch lengths reflect times between infection events, and pendant branch lengths reflect the time between an infection event and a sampling event. Under good conditions (where evolution is clock-like, within-host diversity is low and where sufficient diversity accrues across sampled individuals), a timed phylogenetic tree can be seen as an approximate representation of the true branching tree, though it does not include the information of who infected whom in a direct way. Indeed, the link between pairwise genetic diversity and who infected whom has been widely studied and discussed [6] [7] [8] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . These assumptions may break down for various reasons, but the study of branching trees remains a central tool for modelling phylogenetic trees.

4|chunk|Both the theory of branching processes and Kingman's coalescent theory provide models for branching trees; these have been used to good effect in theoretical epidemiology 11, 14, 15, [18] [19] [20] [21] . The constant rate birth-death and coalescent processes share the simplifying assumption that distribution of times between branching events is exponential, due to the constant rates, mirroring the exponential time distribution in the susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR)-type epidemic models that have been widely used to model the spread of infection 22 . However, exponentially distributed (memory-less) infectious periods are not very realistic for many infections 23-28 . Non-exponential distributions in models of the spread of infection have been a topic of study for decades, and it is well established that incorporating memory in these processes can have large effects on the models' dynamics 24, 26, [29] [30] [31] [32] . Non-exponential distributions, particularly in the infectious period, can also affect
