1|chunk|Background: Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) is the causal agent of postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS), causing large economical losses of the global swine industry. Nitric oxide (NO), as an important signaling molecule, has antiviral activity on some viruses. To date, there is little information on the role of NO during PCV2 infection. Results: We used indirect fluorescence assay (IFA), TCID 50 , real-time RT-qPCR and western blot assay to reveal the role of NO in restricting PCV2 replication. PCV2 replication was inhibited by a form of NO, NO  , whereas PCV2 was not susceptible to another form of NO, NO + . Conclusion: Our findings indicate that the form of NO  has a potential role in the fight against PCV2 infection.
