1|chunk|The results have been inconsistent with regards to the impact of uric acid (UA) on clinical outcomes both in the general population and in patients with chronic kidney disease. The aim of this study was to study the influence of serum UA levels on mortality in patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. Methods: Data on 492 patients from a single peritoneal dialysis unit were retrospectively analyzed. The mean age of the patients was 53.5  15.3 years, with 52% being female (n = 255). The concomitant comorbidities at the start of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) encompassed diabetes mellitus (n = 179, 34.6%), hypertension (n = 419, 85.2%), and cardiovascular disease (n = 186, 37.9%). The study cohort was divided into sex-specific tertiles according to baseline UA level. A Cox proportional hazard model was used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) of all-cause, cardiovascular, and infection-associated mortality with adjustments for demographic and laboratory data, medications, and comorbidities. Results: Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that, using UA tertile 1 as the reference, the adjusted HR of all-cause, cardiovascular, and infection-associated mortality for tertile 3 was 0.4 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.24-0.68, p = 0.001), 0.4 (95% CI 0.2-0.81, p = 0.01), and 0.47 (95% CI 0.19-1.08, p = 0.1). In the fully adjusted model, the adjusted HRs of all-cause, cardiovascular, and infection-associated mortality for each 1-mg/dL increase in UA level were 0.84 (95% CI, 0.69-0.9, p = 0.07), 0.79 (95% CI, 0.61-1.01, p = 0.06), and 0.79 (95% CI, 0.48-1.21, p = 0.32) for men and 0.57 (95% CI, 0.44-0.73, p < 0.001), 0.6 (95% CI, 0.41-0.87, p = 0.006), and 0.41 (95% CI, 0.26-0.6, p < 0.001) for women, respectively. Conclusions: Higher UA levels are associated with lower risks of all-cause, cardiovascular and infection-associated mortality in women treated with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.
