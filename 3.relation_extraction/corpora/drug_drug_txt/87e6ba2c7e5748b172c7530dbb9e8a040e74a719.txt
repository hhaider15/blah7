0|chunk|The CCR532 (rs333) polymorphism is not a predisposing factor for severe pandemic influenza in the Brazilian admixed population

1|chunk|Background: Recent studies have tried to identify host genetic variants that could explain severe cases and deaths in infection with Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, especially among children and young adults. CCR5 is a chemokine receptor expressed on T cells, macrophages and dendritic cells, which is an important mediator of leukocyte chemotaxis during the immune response. A deletion mutation (32) in this gene interferes with the response of immune cells, impairing viral clearance. We evaluated the CCR532 polymorphism (rs333) in individuals of the Brazilian admixed population with a diagnosis of Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection.

2|chunk|A total of 330 subjects with a diagnosis of Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, evaluated at health services in the northern and northeastern regions of Brazil between June 2009 and August 2010, were genotyped for the 32 deletion (rs333). The cases were classified according to the progression of infection into a group of hospitalized patients (n = 156) and a group of non-hospitalized patients (n = 174).

3|chunk|Results: No significant differences in the allele or genotype frequencies of the CCR532 polymorphism were observed between non-hospitalized and hospitalized patients (p = 0.289 and p = 0.431, respectively).

4|chunk|The 32 deletion in the CCR5 gene is not associated with an unfavorable outcome in patients infected with Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 in the Brazilian admixed population.
