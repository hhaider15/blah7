1|chunk|The coronavirus 3 chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL pro ) is a validated target in the design of potential anticoronavirus inhibitors. The high degree of homology within the protease's active site and substrate conservation supports the identification of broad spectrum lead compounds. A previous study identified the compound ML188, also termed 16R, as an inhibitor of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 3CL pro . This study will detail the generation of a homology model of the 3CL pro of the human coronavirus OC43 and determine the potential of 16R to form a broad-spectrum lead compound. MODELLER was used to generate a suitable three-dimensional model of the OC43 3CL pro and the Prime module of Schrdinger predicted the binding conformation and free energy of binding of 16R within the 3CL pro active site. Molecular dynamics further confirmed ligand stability and hydrogen bonding networks. Results: A high quality homology model of the OC43 3CL pro was successfully generated in an active conformation. Further studies reproduced the binding pose of 16R within the active site of the generated model, where its free energy of binding was shown to equal that of the 3CL pro of SARS-CoV, a receptor it is experimentally proven to inhibit. The stability of the ligand was subsequently confirmed by molecular dynamics. Conclusion: The lead compound 16R may represent a broad-spectrum inhibitor of the 3CL pro of OC43 and potentially other coronaviruses. This study provides an atomistic structure of the 3CL pro of OC43 and supports further experimental validation of the inhibitory effects of 16R. These findings further confirm that the 3CL pro of coronaviruses can be inhibited by broad spectrum lead compounds.
