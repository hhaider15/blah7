Non-human primates (NHP) are a highly humanrelevant disease model for infectious agents due to high genetic conservation between humans and NHP. 1-3 However, significant cost and ethical issues often necessitate the use of smaller animal models for both basic and translational research. Mice (Mus musculus) are a favoured small animal model due to widespread availability, incisive transgenic models, comprehensive genomic information 4 and readily available reagents. However, for many viruses, alternative animal models better recapitulate human physiology and disease. Ferrets (Mustela putorius furo) have been employed to study the pathogenesis of a variety of human pathogens, including human and avian influenzas, coronaviruses including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), 5-14 human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV), 15-20 human metapneumovirus (HMPV), 21 Ebola virus 22-28 and henipavirus (Nipah virus and Hendra virus). 29-34 While ferrets

Here, we review recent insights gained from ferret models of human respiratory diseases, with a major focus on influenza, and highlight several knowledge gaps whose closure will greatly enhance the informational gain from ferret models to advance development of human vaccines and therapeutics.

3|chunk|Ferrets are a well-established model for studying both the pathogenesis and transmission of human respiratory viruses and evaluation of antiviral vaccines. Advanced immunological studies would add substantial value to the ferret models of disease but are hindered by the low number of ferret-reactive reagents available for flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. Nevertheless, progress has been made to understand immune responses in the ferret model with a limited set of ferret-specific reagents and assays. This review examines current immunological insights gained from the ferret model across relevant human respiratory diseases, with a focus on influenza viruses. We highlight key knowledge gaps that need to be bridged to advance the utility of ferrets for immunological studies.
