1|chunk|Key indicators: single-crystal X-ray study; T = 120 K; mean (C-C) = 0.003 ; R factor = 0.048; wR factor = 0.127; data-to-parameter ratio = 12.4.

2|chunk|In the title pyrazolone derivative, C 15 H 12 N 2 O, the fivemembered ring is approximately planar (r.m.s. deviation = 0.018  ), and the N-and C-bound benzene rings are inclined to this plane [dihedral angles = 21.45 (10) and 6.96 (10) , respectively] and form a dihedral angle of 20.42 (10) with each other. Supramolecular layers are formed in the crystal structure via C-H  O and C-H  N interactions, and these are assembled into double layers by C-H   andinteractions between the pyrazole and C-bound benzene rings [ring centroid-centroid distance = 3.6476 (12)  ]. The double layers stack along the a axis being connected byinteractions between the N-and C-bound benzene rings [ring centroid-centroid distance = 3.7718 (12)  ].
