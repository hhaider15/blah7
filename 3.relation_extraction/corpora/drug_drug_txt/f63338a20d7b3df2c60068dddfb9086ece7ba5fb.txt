1|chunk|From 2002 to 2003, a global pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) spread to 5 continents and caused 8000 respiratory infections and 800 deaths. To ameliorate the effects of future outbreaks as well as to prepare for biodefense, a process for the production of a recombinant protein vaccine candidate is under development. Previously, we reported the 5 L scale expression and purification of a promising recombinant SARS vaccine candidate, RBD219-N1, the 218-amino acid residue receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS coronavirus expressed in yeast-Pichia pastoris X-33. When adjuvanted with aluminum hydroxide, this protein elicited high neutralizing antibody titers and high RBD-specific antibody titers. However, the yield of RBD219-N1 (60 mg RBD219-N1 per liter of fermentation supernatant; 60 mg/L FS) still required improvement to reach our target of >100 mg/L FS. In this study, we optimized the 10 L scale production process and increased the fermentation yield 6-to 7-fold to 400 mg/ L FS with purification recovery >50%. A panel of characterization tests indicated that the process is reproducible and that the purified, tag-free RBD219-N1 protein has high purity and a well-defined This is an open access article under the CC BY license structure and is therefore a suitable candidate for production under current Good Manufacturing Practice and future phase-1 clinical trials.

2|chunk|In our previous study, 13 we had developed a production process to express and purify several tag-free recombinant RBD constructs in yeast and had identified one of the yeast-expressed RBDs, RBD219-N1 (residues 319-536), as a promising SARS vaccine candidate due to its Chen et al.

3|chunk|Purified RBD219-N1 was diluted with deionized water to a final concentration of 0.3-0.4 mg/mL and analyzed by circular dichroism (CD) on a Jasco-810 spectropolarimeter (Easton, MD) with a 6-position Peltier temperature controller. The CD spectra were obtained from 260 to 185 nm with the Jasco J-1500s spectrophotometer set at 100 nm/min and a response time of 1 s at 25C. The obtained CD data were analyzed using CDPro software by comparing to the reference sets (SP43, SP37, SDP48, and SDP42) using 2 data-fitting programs (CONTIN and CDSSTR). The analyzed secondary structure was also compared with the secondary structure predicted by Phyre2 (Protein Homology/analogY Recognition Chen et al.
