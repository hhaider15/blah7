1|chunk|Human bocavirus (HBoV) is a member of the genus Bocavirus, family Parvoviridae, and subfamily Parvovirus and was first identified in nasopharyngeal aspirates of Swedish children with acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI) in 2005. It is the causative agent of nasopharyngeal aspirate disease and death in children. The HboV genomic structure is a linear single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Its clinical pathogenic characteristics have been extensively studied, however, at present the molecular mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of HBoV infection is not completely clear. In this study, a total of 293 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) between ARTI cases and healthy plasma samples were characterized using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)-coupled bioinformatics analysis, among which 148 were up-regulated and 135 were down-regulated. Gene Ontology (GO) and Cluster of Orthologous Groups of proteins (COG) annotated an enrichment of DEPs in complement activation and biological processes like immunity, inflammation, signal transduction, substance synthesis, and metabolism. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis enriched DEPs mainly in the Wnt signaling pathway (ko04310), PPAR signaling pathway (ko03320), intestinal immune network for IgA production (ko04672), complement and coagulation cascades (ko04610), Toll-like receptor signaling pathway (ko04620) and B cell receptor signaling pathway (ko04662). Further, expression levels of three candidate proteins (upregulated PPP2R1A and CUL1, and downregulated CETP) were validated using western blotting. Our investigation is the first analysis of the proteomic profile of HBoV-infected ARTI cases using the iTRAQ approach, providing a foundation for a better molecular understanding of the pathogenesis of ARTI in children.

2|chunk|which together are a significant worldwide contributor to morbidity and mortality in children up to age 5 [4, 5] . Since HBoV was first detected in 2005 in children with respiratory infections [1], four different subtypes have been identified (HBoV 1, 2, 3, and 4) [6-8]. HBoV-1 was predominantly detected in the respiratory tract, whereas the three other types (HBoV-2, HBoV-3, and HBoV-4) were mainly identified in stool and associated with gastroenteritis [8]. However, HBoV can also found in asymptomatic people [9] . A genomic study of HBoV suggested a rearrangement of the HBoV group into two classes: human bocaparvovirus 1 (including the previous HBoV-1 and HBoV-3) and human bocaparvovirus 2 (including the previous HBoV-2 and HBoV-4) [10] .

3|chunk|HBoV infects individuals worldwide with the average prevalence in respiratory tract samples ranged from 1.0% to 56.8% and in stool specimens from 1.3% to 63% [11]. HBoV is transmitted around the year but infections are enriched during winter and spring [12] . The prevalence of HBoV-1 ranged from 1.5 to 19% in children diagnosed with acute respiratory diseases [13] , whereas the prevalence of the three other types ranged from 1% to 26%, 0.4% to 5%, and 0% to 2% in fecal samples from subjects with gastrointestinal illnesses, respectively [14, 15] . Clinical symptoms in HBoV-infected patients include rhinitis, pharyngitis, cough, dyspnea, wheezing, pneumonia, acute otitis media, fever, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea [9]. The coinfection rates of cases with respiratory infections and HBoV-positivity ranges from 8.3% to 100%, and the coinfection ratio is 46.7% relative to gastrointestinal manifestations [16] . Lekana-Douki et al. (2018) reported that in 810 nasal swabs and 317 fecal specimens from up to 5-year old children with influenza-like illness or diarrhea in Gabon, 32 (4.4%) and 7 (2.2%) were positive for HBoV [17] . Further, coinfections ratio with at least one other respiratory virus, or intestinal viruses were 84.4% and 42.8%, respectively.

4|chunk|Delays in the diagnosis of infectious disease and the inappropriate use of antibiotics are generally caused by diagnostic uncertainty. Therefore, the development of diagnostic markers for infectious diseases will facilitate more rapid diagnosis and the distinction between infection and non-infectious diseases, leading to improved management, better treatment course and outcomes, and a reduction in the inappropriate use of antibiotics. Proteomics provides for a comprehensive global analysis and is widely used to investigate complex biological functions [18] for identification and characterization of proteins related to pathogenesis and virus-host interactions, contributing to new knowledge of the pathogenesis of various diseases. Twodimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE) and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-timeof-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/MS) are widely applied to study the proteomic expression profiles of host cells responding to viral infections, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome [19], H1N1 influenza virus [20], and spleen and kidney necrosis virus [21] . However, 2DE has certain distinct disadvantages, including the ability to identify only a limited number of proteins within a sample and its insensitivity to small and low-abundance proteins. Isobaric tags for the relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) along with nano liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (NanoLC-MS/MS) has emerged as a more powerful quantitative proteomic method because of its high sensitivity and reproducibility, particularly for quantifying low-abundance proteins in the examined samples [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] .

5|chunk|Knowledge of the pathogenesis of HBoV is very limited, mainly caused by the short of specific cell lines for virus culture or experimental animal models [9] . A deep knowledge of pathogenesis of HBoV is essential for the prevention and treatment of HBoV. Currently, iTRAQbased proteomics have been widely applied to study differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) of virus-host interactions for understanding the host response to viral infection [22, 24, 25] . In the present study, iTRAQ coupled with LC-MS/MS was used to detect and characterize differentially expressed proteins in the plasma of the respiratory tract in patients infected with HBoV and healthy controls. The results will provide novel insight into the regulatory High-throughput proteomics analysis reveals alterations of plasma proteins in patients infected with bocavirus PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.
