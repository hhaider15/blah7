1|chunk|The A2MC2 serially passaged 90 times (A2MC2-P90) retains the feature of interferon induction. The A2MC2-P90 replicates faster with a higher virus yield than wild type A2MC2 virus. Infection of primary pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAMs) also induces interferons. Sequence analysis showed that the A2MC2-P90 has genomic nucleic acid identity of 99.8% to the wild type but has a deletion of 543 nucleotides in nsp2. The deletion occurred in passage 60. The A2MC2-P90 genome has a total of 35 nucleotide variations from the wild type, leading to 26 amino acid differences. Inoculation of three-week-old piglets showed that A2MC2-P90 is avirulent and elicits immune response. Compared with Ingelvac PRRS  MLV strain, A2MC2-P90 elicits higher virus neutralizing antibodies. The attenuated IFN-inducing A2MC2-P90 should be useful for development of an improved PRRSV vaccine.

2|chunk|Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is an economically important swine contagious disease across the world, which has resulted in an estimated $664 million loss per year to the swine industry in the United States alone 1 . The causative agent of the contagious disease is PRRS virus (PRRSV), a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus of the family Arteriviridae 2,3 . The main target cells for PRRSV infection of pigs are pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAMs) 4 . PRRSV propagation in vitro is generally conducted in MARC-145 cells, derived from MA-104, a kidney cell line of an African green monkey 5 .

3|chunk|PRRSV appears to inhibit synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs) in pigs, whereas swine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) induce high levels of IFN- 6-8 . PRRSV antagonizes induction of type I IFNs in both PAMs and MARC-145 cells as infection of the cells in vitro leads to very low level interferon- (IFN- ) expression 6, 9, 10 . Type I IFNs are critical to the innate immunity against viral infections and play an important role in activation of the adaptive immune response 11,12 . Adenovirus-mediated expression of IFN- in pigs leads to reduction in disease signs when the animals were challenged with PRRSV 13 . Presence of the exogenous IFN- at the time of PRRSV infection alters innate and adaptive immune responses by increasing IFN- secreting cells and changing cytokine profile in the lung 14 days post-infection 14 .

4|chunk|An atypical type 2 PRRSV strain A2MC2 induces synthesis of type I IFNs in the cultured cells and replication of A2MC2 is needed for the IFN induction, whereas PRRSV strains VR-2332, Ingelvac PRRS  MLV, NVSL 97-7895 and VR-2385 do not induce detectable IFNs 15 . Experimental infection of pigs with the A2MC2 strain leads to earlier onset and higher levels of virus-neutralizing antibodies than the Ingelvac PRRS  MLV vaccine strain 16 . Virus neutralizing antibodies against PRRSV confer protection of pigs against challenge with virulent strain 17 . Passive transfer of PRRSV-neutralizing antibodies in pregnant sows confers sterilizing immunity against
