1|chunk|Background and Aims: Hepatitis C Virus (HCV)-related liver disease progresses more rapidly in individuals co-infected with Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 (HIV), although the underlying immunologic mechanisms are unknown. We examined whether HIV-specific T-cells are identified in the liver of HCV/HIV co-infected individuals and promote liver inflammation through bystander immune responses.

2|chunk|Methods: Ex-vivo intra-hepatic lymphocytes from HCV mono-infected and HCV/HIV co-infected individuals were assessed for immune responses to HIV and HCV antigens by polychromatic flow cytometry.

3|chunk|Results: HCV/HIV liver biopsies had similar frequencies of lymphocytes but lower percentages of CD4 + T-cells compared to HCV biopsies. In co-infection, intra-hepatic HIV-specific CD8 + and CD4 + T-cells producing IFN-c and TNF-a were detected and were comparable in frequency to those that were HCV-specific. In co-infected individuals, viral-specific CD8 + T-cells produced more of the fibrogenic cytokine, TNF-a. In both mono-and co-infected individuals, intra-hepatic HCV-specific Tcells were poorly functional compared to HIV-specific T-cells. In co-infection, HAART was not associated with a reconstitution of intra-hepatic CD4 + T-cells and was associated with reduction in both HIV and HCV-specific intra-hepatic cytokine responses.
