1|chunk|Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is a highly contagious disease in newborn piglets. In our previous study, a genetically engineered Lactobacillus casei oral vaccine (pPG-COE-DCpep/L393) expressing a dendritic cell (DC)-targeting peptide fused with porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) COE antigen was developed. This vaccine induced significant levels of anti-PEDV specific IgG and IgA antibody responses in mice, indicating a potential strategy against PEDV infection. In this study, pPG-COE-DCpep/L393 was used for oral vaccination of newborn piglets against PEDV. We then assessed the immune responses and protection efficacy of pPG-COE-DCpep/L393. An indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) showed that the recombinant Lactobacillus vaccine elicits a specific systemic and mucosal immune response. The T-helper cells mediated by pPG-COE-DCpep/L393 and PEDV infection display a Th1 phenotype. The histopathological results showed that pPG-COE-DCpep/L393 promotes lymphocyte proliferation and effectively protects piglets against PEDV infection. The transforming growth factor- level indicated that the recombinant Lactobacillus vaccine plays a role in anti-inflammatory responses in mesenteric lymph nodes during PEDV infection. These results show that pPG-COE-DCpep/L393 is a potential vaccine against PEDV infection. the CO-26K equivalent, COE), was expressed in transgenic tobacco, and used for immunizing mice, thereby inducing an effective neutralizing antibody response [3] . We therefore hypothesized that a recombinant vaccine using the COE gene would be effective against PEDV infection.

2|chunk|The inactivated and attenuated vaccines (intramuscular route or subcutaneous injection) induced production of maternal antibodies in low titers for a short duration. Most of the maternal antibodies in the milk were digested by gastric acid and pepsin before entering the intestinal tract [4] . Additionally, they did not induce sufficient production of virus-specific IgA antibodies, resulting in inadequate mucosal immunity [5] . Vaccines must effectively provide mucosal protection in the intestinal tract. Mucosal immunity against viral entry into the intestinal epithelial cells was more effective than systemic immunity [6] . Anti-PEDV immunization with an oral vaccine in pregnant swine was better than injected immunization in reducing piglet mortality, and IgA was more important than IgG for protection in the colostrum [7] . Research has suggested that the first line of defense by IgA in the intestine would be more effective than that by IgG for protecting piglets against PEDV infection. Furthermore, dendritic cells (DCs), professional antigen-presenting cells, link humoral and cellular immune responses for homeostasis of the intestinal immune environment, and studies have focused on DC targeting for enhancing antibody titer. DCs can be found in all the lymphoid organs associated with the intestine, such as Peyer's patches (PPs), isolated lymphoid follicles (ILFs), and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs), as well as scattered throughout the subepithelial lamina propria (LP) of both the small intestine and colon [8] [9] [10] .

3|chunk|Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are considered to be safe microorganisms, with beneficial effects on the health of humans and animals [11] . LAB vaccines can therefore be used as a delivery system to regulate the T-helper cell response and stimulate the secretion of specific IgAs for mucosal immunity [12] . However, no research has been carried out on Lactobacillus vaccines for PEDV immunization in piglets. The relationship between inflammation and the LAB of anti-inflammation were also not clear during PEDV infection. Lactobacilli are closely associated with many animal species, making them prospective candidates for developing oral vaccines.

4|chunk|Our laboratory has studied recombinant Lactobacillus vaccines and their role in the prevention of viral-induced diarrhea in piglets for more than a decade. In our previous study, a genetically engineered Lactobacillus casei oral vaccine (pPG-COE-DCpep/L393), expressing a DC-targeting peptide fused with a PEDV COE antigen, was developed [13] . The results showed that oral vaccination with pPG-COE-DCpep/L393 can induce significant levels of anti-PEDV systemic IgG and mucosal IgA antibody responses in mice. However, the effectiveness of IgA as the first line of defense, whether IgA-based mucosal immunity would neutralize PEDV, and the clinical protective effect, were not studied in piglets. The aim of this study was to characterize the immunological mechanisms involved when piglets are vaccinated against PEDV infection with the Lactobacillus vaccine.
