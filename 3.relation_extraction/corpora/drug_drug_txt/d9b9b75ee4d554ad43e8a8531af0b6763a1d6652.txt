1|chunk|Dysfunction of CD8 + T cells can lead to the development of chronic viral infection. Identifying mechanisms responsible for such T cell dysfunction is therefore of great importance to understand how to prevent persistent viral infection. Here we show using lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection that carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1) is fundamental for recruiting lymphocyte-specific protein kinase (Lck) into the T cell receptor complex to form an efficient immunological synapse. CEACAM1 is essential for activation of CD8 + T cells, and the absence of CEACAM1 on virus-specific CD8 + T cells limits the antiviral CD8 + T cell response. Treatment with anti-CEACAM1 antibody stabilizes Lck in the immunological synapse, prevents CD8 + T cell exhaustion, and improves control of virus infection in vivo. Treatment of human virus-specific CD8 + T cells with anti-CEACAM1 antibody similarly enhances their proliferation. We conclude that CEACAM1 is an important regulator of virus-specific CD8 + T cell functions in mice and humans and represents a promising therapeutic target for modulating CD8 + T cells.
