1|chunk|In the context of respiratory disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the leading cause of mortality worldwide. Despite much development in the area of drug development, currently there are no effective medicines available for the treatment of this disease. An imbalance in the protease: Antiprotease ratio in the COPD lung remains an important aspect of COPD pathophysiology and several studies have shown the efficacy of antiprotease therapy in both in vitro and in vivo COPD models. However more in-depth studies will be required to validate the efficacy of lead drug molecules targeting these proteases. This review discusses the current status of protease-directed drugs used for treating COPD and explores the future prospects of utilizing the potential of antiprotease-based therapeutics as a treatment for this disease. and viral pathogens may also play a major role in the development of COPD and contribute to the rise in exacerbation frequency among the COPD population [19] [20] [21] . Given the increasing healthcare and societal burden associated with the increase in COPD, a number of therapeutic programmes are ongoing to develop strategies for the treatment of COPD [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . As it will be beyond the scope of this review to discuss all of the ongoing therapeutic programmes, we will focus on the current status of antiprotease therapy against COPD.

2|chunk|The protease: Antiprotease imbalance is considered to be one of the core physiological mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of COPD [31]. One of the major genetic causes of COPD is A1AT deficiency [32] . A1AT is a serine protease inhibitor which regulates the neutrophilic chemotaxis involving both CXCR1 and FcRIIIb signaling [33] . In addition, A1AT has also been shown to regulate the levels of cathepsin B and metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2) in A1AT deficient patients treated with A1AT augmentation therapy [34] .

3|chunk|There are four different types of proteases namely serine, cysteine, aspartic, and MMPs which are thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of COPD. Among serine proteases, specifically, neutrophil elastase (NE), dipeptidyl peptidase 4, cathepsin G, proteinase 3, cathepsin C, mast cell-derived tryptase and chymase are found to be associated with the severity of COPD [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] . The metal-activated proteinases including MMP-2, MMP-8, MMP-9, MMP-12, and MMP-13 are found to be highly expressed in both in vivo models and clinical samples [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] . The cysteine proteases including caspase-1, caspase-3, caspase-7, caspase-8, caspase-9, caspase-11, cathepsin K, and cathepsin S have also been shown to be up-regulated in COPD patients [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] . Finally, elevated levels of the aspartic proteases cathepsin D and cathepsin E have been demonstrated in COPD patient tissue and various COPD models [56] [57] [58] [59] .
