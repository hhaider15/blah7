1|chunk|Background: Endothelial cells are believed to play an important role in response to virus infection. Our previous microarray analysis showed that H9N2 virus infection and inactivated viral particle inoculation increased the expression of interferon-inducible transmembrane protein 1 (IFITM1) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). In present study, we deeply investigated the expression patterns of IFITM1 and IFITM1-mediated antiviral response induced by H9N2 virus infection and inactivated viral particle inoculation in HUVECs. Epithelial cells that are considered target cells of the influenza virus were selected as a reference control. Methods: First, we quantified the expression levels of IFITM1 in HUVECs induced by H9N2 virus infection or viral particle inoculation using quantitative real-time PCR and western blot. Second, we observed whether hemagglutinin or neuraminidase affected IFITM1 expression in HUVECs. Finally, we investigated the effect of induced-IFITM1 on the antiviral state in HUVECs by siRNA and activation plasmid transfection.

2|chunk|Results: Both H9N2 virus infection and viral particle inoculation increased the expression of IFITM1 without elevating the levels of interferon-/ in HUVECs. HA or NA protein binding alone is not sufficient to increase the levels of IFITM1 and interferon-/ in HUVECs. IFITM1 induced by viral particle inoculation significantly decreased the virus titers in culture supernatants of HUVECs. Conclusions: Our results showed that inactivated viral particle inoculation increased the expression of IFITM1 at mRNA and protein levels. Moreover, the induction of IFITM1 expression mediated the antiviral state in HUVECs.
