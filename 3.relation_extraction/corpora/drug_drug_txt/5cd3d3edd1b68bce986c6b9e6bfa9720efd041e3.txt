0|chunk|A rebuttal to the comments on the genome order index and the Z-curve

1|chunk|Background: Elhaik, Graur and Josic recently commented on the genome order index (S) and the Z-curve (Elhaik et al. Biol Direct 2010, 5: 10). S is a quantity defined as S = a 2 + c 2 + g 2 + t 2 , where a, c, g and t denote corresponding base frequencies. The Z-curve is a three dimensional curve that represents a DNA sequence in the manner that each can be uniquely reconstructed given the other. Elhaik et al. made 4 major claims. 1) In the previous mapping system with the regular tetrahedron, calculation of the radius of the inscribed sphere is "a mathematical error". 2) S follows an exponential distribution and is narrowly distributed with a range of (0.25 -0.33). 3) Based on the Chargaff's second parity rule (PR2), "S is equivalent to H [Shannon entropy]" and they are derivable from each other. 4) Z-curve "suffers from over dimensionality", because based on the analysis of 235 bacterial genomes, x and y components contributed only less than 1% of the variance and therefore "would be of little use".

Conclusion: Elhaik et al. confuse S (a single number) with Z-curve (a series of 3D coordinates), which are distinct. To use S as a case study of Z-curve, by itself, is invalid. S and H are neither equivalent nor derivable from each other. The criticisms of Elhaik, Graur and Josic are wrong.
