1|chunk|The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged in 2012 and caused continual outbreaks worldwide with high mortality. However, no effective anti-MERS-CoV drug is currently available. Recently, numerous evolutionary studies have suggested that MERS-CoV originated from bat coronavirus (BatCoV). We herein reported that three peptides derived from the HR2 region in spike protein of BatCoV HKU4, including HKU4-HR2P1, HKU4-HR2P2 and HKU4-HR2P3, could bind the MERS-CoV HR1-derived peptide to form a six-helix bundle (6-HB) with high stability. Moreover, these peptides, particularly HKU4-HR2P2 and HKU4-HR2P3, exhibited potent inhibitory activity against MERS-CoV S-mediated cell-cell fusion and viral infection, suggesting that these HKU4 HR2-derived peptides could be candidates for futher development as antiviral agents against MERS-CoV infection.

2|chunk|Viruses 2019, 11, 56 2 of 12 displays its spike protein (S), a type I transmembrane glycoprotein, on its enveloped membrane surface in a trimer state. S protein contains two subunits: S1 subunit (S1) and S2 subunit (S2). S1 recognizes and binds the cellular receptor, while S2 mediates viral and cellular membrane fusion. The interaction between the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in S1 and the receptor (DPP4) on the host cell surface induces S2 structural changes, including the insertion of N-terminal fusion peptide into the host cell membrane, the formation of a homotrimer by heptad repeat 1 (HR1) helices, exposing three hydrophobic grooves on the surface, and the binding of three heptad repeat 2 (HR2) molecules to the hydrophobic grooves of HR1 trimer to form a six-helix bundle (6-HB), which brings the viral and cell membranes close together for fusion. Finally, MERS-CoV releases its genetic materials into target cells ( Figure 1B) [11, 12] . Disrupting the process of MERS-6HB formation can inhibit virus-cell membrane fusion and abolish viral infection [13, 14] . Our previous studies found that a peptide, MERS-HR2P, derived from the MERS-CoV HR2 region, could prevent the formation of the fusion core by competitively binding to HR1 and blocking the native interaction between HR1 and HR2 ( Figure 1B) . MERS-HR2P has no effect on SARS-CoV infection, and SARS-CoV HR2-derived peptide, CP-1, failed to inhibit MERS-CoV infection [14, 15] , suggesting that MERS-HR2P is specific for inibiting MERS-CoV infection. Whether other novel and potent peptide fusion inhibitors can be developed against MERS-CoV from other coronavirus HR2 regions is still unclear.

3|chunk|Although camels are the intermediate host for the transmission of MERS-CoV, bats are likely to be its original source and serve as the natural host [10, [16] [17] [18] . Phylogenetically, MERS-CoV is very closely related to Tylonycteris sp. Bat CoV HKU4 (Ty-BatCoV HKU4) ( Figure 1A ). Similar to MERS-CoV, HKU4 also harbors the ability to use human DPP4 as the receptor for infecting the target cell [19, 20] . We herein identified that HKU4-HR2P1, HKU4-HR2P2 and HKU4-HR2P3 peptides, derived from the HKU4 HR2 region, could bind MERS-HR1P, a MERS-CoV HR1-derived peptide, and mimic the interaction of MERS-CoV HR1 and HR2 regions to form stable 6-HB. Moreover, these peptides exhibited significant inhibitory activity in both MERS-CoV S-mediated cell-cell fusion assay and pseudovirus infection assay, with even more potency than that of the reported peptide, MERS-HR2P. Taken together, these HKU4 HR2-derived peptides could be considered as candidates for the development of anti-MERS-CoV agents for clinical use.
