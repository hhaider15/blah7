1|chunk|Since the first isolation from human, astroviruses have been detected in many species. Wide host range and occasional cross-transmission of astrovirus pose a risk for zoonotic infection. Here, novel astroviruses were identified from goslings with recent epidemic gout disease in China. A virus, designated as GD, was efficiently isolated from a diseased gosling using LMH cells. Genome of GD amplified using 5 and 3 RACE was 7183nt in full length. Sequence analysis revealed the genome of GD was <60.8% homology with others deposited in Genbank. Moreover, GD could be neutralized by goose convalescent sera, and the gout associated symptom in goslings could be reproduced by GD infection. Our data demonstrated the goose astrovirus could be one of the causative agents of the ongoing gosling gout disease in China. The identification of the goose astrovirus not only diversified the astrovirus species, but also broadened the disease patterns caused by astroviruses.
