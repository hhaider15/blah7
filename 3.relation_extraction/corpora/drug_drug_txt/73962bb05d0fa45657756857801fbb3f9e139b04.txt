1|chunk|Transforming growth factor (TGF-)/TGF- receptor signal is known to promote cell migration. Up-regulation of TGF- in serum/peritoneal fluid and increased levels of pluripotent transcription factor OCT4 in endometriotic tissues are frequently observed in patients with endometriosis. However, the mechanisms underlying how TGF-/TGF- receptor and OCT4 affect endometriotic cell migration still remain largely unknown. Therefore, endometriotic tissue with high cell migratory capacity were collected from patients with adenomyotic myometrium (n = 23) and chocolate cyst (n = 24); and endometrial tissue with low cell migratory capacity in normal endometrium or hyperplastic endometrium (n = 8) were collected as the controls. We found the mRNA levels of TGF- receptor I (TGF- RI) and OCT4 were significantly higher in the high-migratory ectopic endometriotic tissues than those of the lowmigratory normal or hyperplastic endometrium. Positive correlations between TGF- RI and OCT4, and either TGF- RI or OCT4 with migration-related genes (SNAIL, SLUG and TWIST) regarding the mRNA levels were observed in human endometriotic tissues. TGF-I dose-dependently increased the gene and protein levels of OCT4, SNAIL and N-Cadherin (N-CAD) and silencing of endogenous OCT4 significantly suppressed the TGF-I-induced expressions of N-CAD and SNAIL in primary human endometriotic stromal cells and human endometrial carcinoma cell lines RL95-2 and HEC1A. Furthermore, TGF-I significantly increased the migration ability of endometriotic cells and silencing of OCT4 dramatically suppressed the TGF-I-induced cell migration activity evidenced by wound-closure assay, transwell assay, and confocal image of F-actin cellular distribution. In conclusion, the present findings demonstrate that the niche TGF- plays a critical role in initiating expressions of PLOS ONE |
