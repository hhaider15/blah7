1|chunk|MBL2 polymorphisms and TB has been studied in various populations, the results are controversial. In this study four functional single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs, H/L, X/Y, P/Q and A/B) across the MBL2 gene were genotyped by direct DNA sequencing of PCR products in a case-control population of Chinese Han origin, consisting of 1,020 patients with pulmonary TB and 1,020 controls. We found that individuals carrying variant allele at A/B (namely BB or AB genotypes) was associated with increased susceptibility to TB (odds ratios [OR] = 1.57, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.30-1.91, P = 1.3  10 6 ). Additionally, LYPB haplotype showed a significant association with increased risk of TB (OR = 1.54, 95% CI 1.27-1.87, P = 4.2  10 6 ; global haplotype association P = 3.5  10 5 ). Furthermore, individuals bearing low-or medium-MBL expression haplotype pairs had an increased risk of TB (OR = 1.56, 95% CI 1.29-1.90, P = 1.4  10 6 ). Thus, the reduced expression of functional MBL secondary to having MBL2 variants may partially mediate the increased susceptibility to TB risk.

2|chunk|Mtb presumably infects a third of the world's population, with China has the second-largest number of infected cases 1 . Despite the improved treatment during the past decades, TB remains the first leading cause of global death from infectious diseases. The host-pathogen interactions and environmental factors may contribute to TB. Furthermore, Host genetic variability is an important determinant of the risk of developing TB in humans 2 . Unraveling the genetic factor contributing to the pathogenesis of TB may lead to improved treatment and prevention of this disease 3 .

3|chunk|The innate immune response in human activates the T helper 1 (Th1)-type immune system and plays an important role in the host's defense against the development of TB 4 . Many studies have reported the association between TB and genetic polymorphisms related to human innate immunity 5 . Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is a member of the collectin family that recognizes pathogens by its carbohydrate-recognition domains 6 . MBL is an acute-phase serum protein, which is synthesized in the liver and circulates as oligomers complexed with MBL-associated serine proteases (MASPs) 7 . MASPs binds to the sugar moieties on the surface of a pathogen, and then are activated to initiate the lectin pathway of complement activation, resulting in opsonization
