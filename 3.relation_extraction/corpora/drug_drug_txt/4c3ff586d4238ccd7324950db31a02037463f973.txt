1|chunk|In the present study, anti-IBV (infectious bronchitis virus) activities of (-)pinenes were studied by MTT assay, as well as docking and molecular dynamic (MD) simulations. The CC 50 values of (-)--pinene and (-)--pinene were above 10 mM. And the maximum noncytotoxic concentrations (TD 0 ) of (-)--pinene and (-)--pinene were determined as 7.88  0.06 and 6.09  0.31 mM, respectively. The two compounds were found to inhibit IBV with an IC 50 of 0.98  0.25 and 1.32  0.11 mM. The MTT assay showed that the inhibitions of (-)-pinenes against IBV appear to occur moderately before entering the cell but are much stronger occur after penetration of the virus into the cell. Molecular simulations indicated that (-)--pinene and (-)--pinene specifically interact with the active site which is located at the N terminus of phosphorylated nucleocapsid (N) protein, with the former being more potent than the latter. The binding energies of them are 36.83 and 35.59 kcal mol 1 , respectively. Results presented here may suggest that (-)-pinene and (-)--pinene possess anti-IBV properties, and therefore are a potential source of anti-IBV ingredients for the pharmaceutical industry.
