1|chunk|Hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) is a common childhood disease with substantial disease burden in Asia. Mixed results were reported on the associations between HFMD incidence and meteorological factors or school holidays, while limited studies focused on their association on transmissibility. We aimed to measure the transmissibility of HFMD and to examine its potential driving factors in Hong Kong. A likelihood-based procedure was used to estimate time-dependent effective reproduction number (R t ) based on weekly number of HFMD-associated hospitalizations from 2010 to 2014. The associations of between-year effects, depletion of susceptibles, absolute humidity and school holidays with R t were examined using linear regression. R t usually started increasing between early spring and summer and peaked in April to May at around 1.1-1.2, followed by a slight rebound in autumn. Depletion of susceptibles and between-years effects explained most of the variances (19 and 13% respectively) in R t . We found a negative association between depletion of susceptibles and R t (coefficients ranged from 0.14 to 0.03 for different years), but the estimated effects of absolute humidity and school holidays were insignificant. Overall, HFMD transmission was moderate in Hong Kong and was mainly associated with depletion of susceptibles. Limited impact was suggested from meteorological factors and school holidays.

2|chunk|Hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) causes a substantial disease burden in Asian regions including Hong Kong, mainly in children below 5 years of age 1-4 . Enterovirus 71 (EV71), coxsackievirus A16 (CA16) and coxsackievirus A6 (CA6) are the most common enterovirus serotypes causing HFMD in Hong Kong 2,5 . HFMD has a clear seasonal pattern in temperate regions with annual peaks in the summer 1,6 , while in tropical and subtropical regions including Hong Kong, multiple peaks may occur within a year 2,7 . Inconsistent findings about the associations between meteorological factors, such as temperature and relative humidity, and the incidence of HFMD were reported by different studies [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] .

3|chunk|HFMD is considered to be transmitted mainly through direct contact with contaminated discharges, fluid of blisters or stool from infected persons, or contaminated objects 16 . Attending kindergarten or child-care center and visiting public playground were also reported as risk factors for HFMD [17] [18] [19] . HFMD is highly transmissible, with a basic reproduction number (R 0 ) ranging from 2.5 to 5.5 for different serotypes in Hong Kong and Singapore 20,21 . A temperature of 21.1 to 26.7 C, higher relative humidity and school period were reported to be associated with higher HFMD transmission in mainland China 22 . Other factors, such as host susceptibility and virus-specific transmissibility were also found to play vital roles in transmission of infectious diseases 23 . Currently, there is a lack of evidence about the potential risk factors and their impact on HFMD transmission. This study therefore aims to examine the transmissibility of HFMD and its potential driving factors in Hong Kong, where HFMD shows less obvious seasonality.
