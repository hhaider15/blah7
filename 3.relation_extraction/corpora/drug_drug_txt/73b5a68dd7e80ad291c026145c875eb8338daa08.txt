1|chunk|. Error on determining the centre of the particle using the cHough. The error on the determination of the centre of individual particles (alignment particle) using the cHough method was estimated by simulation (see Methods section for details). The error is defined here as the standard deviation of the error. Here, a diameter of 80 nm and a thickness of 30 nm were used. Several combinations of linker size (secondary and primary labelling) and localization error (Loc) were tested. Supplementary Figure 2. MCV model. (a) Protein shell used by the MCV model. Its descriptive parameters (diameter and thickness) are indicated. (b) Virus images and corresponding radial histograms obtained from the MCV model for different values of diameter and thickness.

2|chunk|Diameter and thickness are indicated as diameter/thickness (for instance, 120/30 represents a 120 nm diameter and 30 nm thickness). The other simulation parameters were set as follows: 15 nm localization error and primary labelling (10 nm linker size). The virus images were reconstructed from 10,000 localizations and the radial histograms were evaluated from 10,000,000 localizations. Scale bar: 100 nm
