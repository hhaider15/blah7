2|chunk|Abstract: MERS-CoV is present in dromedary camels throughout the Middle East and Africa. Dromedary camels are the primary zoonotic reservoir for human infections. Interruption of the zoonotic transmission chain from camels to humans, therefore, may be an effective strategy to control the ongoing MERS-CoV outbreak. Here we show that vaccination with an adjuvanted MERS-CoV Spike protein subunit vaccine confers complete protection from MERS-CoV disease in alpaca and results in reduced and delayed viral shedding in the upper airways of dromedary camels. Protection in alpaca correlates with high serum neutralizing antibody titers. Lower titers of serum neutralizing antibodies correlate with delayed and significantly reduced shedding in the nasal turbinates of dromedary camels. Together, these data indicate that induction of robust neutralizing humoral immune responses by vaccination of nave animals reduces shedding that potentially could diminish the risk of zoonotic transmission. and virus isolation [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . Serologic studies suggest that MERS-CoV has been present in dromedary camels for at least three decades in regions as wide ranging as the Middle East, North Africa, and East Africa [16] . The outbreak among human populations has persisted-albeit in low numbers-despite a lack of sustained human-to-human transmission [17, 18] . Data from molecular epidemiologic studies suggest that the outbreak has endured through multiple zoonotic spillover events from dromedary camels to humans. Additionally, several studies in Saudi Arabia and Qatar have demonstrated a clear epidemiologic link between camel and human populations [4, [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] .

3|chunk|Although MERS-CoV typically causes severe pneumonia in humans, the virus primarily infects the upper respiratory tract of dromedary camels, from where viable virus is shed in high quantities for approximately 7 days, and where viral RNA can be detected up to 35 days [27] . Occupational exposure that involves close proximity to infected dromedary camels is a major risk factor for human acquisition. This risk profile has been confirmed by studies in Saudi Arabia where camel herders and slaughterhouse workers were much more likely than the general population to either have serologic evidence of past exposure to 26] .

4|chunk|The high case fatality rate, continued zoonotic transmission, and sustained animal reservoir of MERS-CoV underscore the need for intervention strategies focused on preventing zoonotic transmission. Here, we evaluated the efficacy of an intramuscular, adjuvanted S1 subunit vaccine to prevent infection or reduce shedding in dromedary camels (Camelus dromedarius) and alpaca (Vicugna pacos).
