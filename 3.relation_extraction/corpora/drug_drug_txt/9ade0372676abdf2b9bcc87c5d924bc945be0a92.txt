0|chunk|Genome Sequences of Human Coronavirus OC43 and NL63, Associated with Respiratory Infections in Kilifi, Kenya

1|chunk|Coding-complete genomes of two human coronavirus OC43 strains and one NL63 strain were obtained by metagenomic sequencing of clinical samples collected in 2017 and 2018 in Kilifi, Kenya. Maximum likelihood phylogenies showed that the OC43 strains were genetically dissimilar and that the NL63 strain was closely related to NL63 genotype B viruses.
