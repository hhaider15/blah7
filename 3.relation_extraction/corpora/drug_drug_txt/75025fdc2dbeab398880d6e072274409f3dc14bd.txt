0|chunk|ZCURVE_V: a new self-training system for recognizing protein-coding genes in viral and phage genomes

1|chunk|Background: It necessary to use highly accurate and statistics-based systems for viral and phage genome annotations. The GeneMark systems for gene-finding in virus and phage genomes suffer from some basic drawbacks. This paper puts forward an alternative approach for viral and phage gene-finding to improve the quality of annotations, particularly for newly sequenced genomes.
