1|chunk|The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) ensures regulation of the protein pool in the cell by ubiquitination of proteins followed by their degradation by the proteasome. It plays a central role in the cell under normal physiological conditions as well as during viral infections. On the one hand, the UPS can be used by the cell to degrade viral proteins, thereby restricting the viral infection. On the other hand, it can also be subverted by the virus to its own advantage, notably to induce degradation of cellular restriction factors. This makes the UPS a central player in viral restriction and counter-restriction. In this respect, the human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV-1 and 2) represent excellent examples. Indeed, many steps of the HIV life cycle are restricted by cellular proteins, some of which are themselves components of the UPS. However, HIV itself hijacks the UPS to mediate defense against several cellular restriction factors. For example, the HIV auxiliary proteins Vif, Vpx and Vpu counteract specific restriction factors by the recruitment of cellular UPS components. In this review, we describe the interplay between HIV and the UPS to illustrate its role in the restriction of viral infections and its hijacking by viral proteins for counter-restriction.

2|chunk|Viruses 2017, 9, 322 2 of 21 eukaryotic peptide of 76 amino acids, which can be conjugated to proteins, mainly on their lysine residues. The addition of a single ubiquitin or small ubiquitin chains is involved in many regulatory functions, whereas poly-ubiquitination at lysine 48 (K48), corresponding to the addition of chains exceeding four ubiquitins, serves as a signal for degradation [2] [3] [4] [5] . Ubiquitination is dependent on the ubiquitin machinery: the ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1 first forms a high-energy thiol-ester link with ubiquitin in an ATP dependent manner; ubiquitin is then transferred onto a thiol group of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2; finally, the ubiquitin ligase E3 transfers ubiquitin onto a lysine of its substrate ( Figure 1A ) [6, 7] . In humans, there are two E1 enzymes, around 40 different E2 enzymes, which primarily determine the type of ubiquitin chain that is added, as well as over 700 different E3 ubiquitin ligases, which ensure targeting of various substrates and can be separated into two main families: HECT (Homologous to E6-AP Carboxyl Terminal) and RING (Really Interesting New Gene) ubiquitin ligases. DUBs are equally important for maturation, regulation and recycling of ubiquitin [2] [3] [4] [5] .

3|chunk|A protein can be conjugated to different types of polyubiquitin chains, depending on which of the seven lysine residues of ubiquitin is used to link ubiquitin moieties in the chain. Proteins ubiquitinated by K48-linked chains are mainly destined for proteasomal degradation [8, 9] . The 20S proteasome is a barrel-shaped structure composed of four rings: two outer rings composed of seven -subunits and two inner rings composed of seven -subunits, which carry the protease activity on the inside of the ring. The 26S proteasome is formed by association of a 20S proteasome with two 19S lids, which ensure specific recognition of ubiquitinated substrates, recycling of ubiquitin through deubiquitination, unfolding of the target protein and translocation through the 20S barrel ( Figure 1B) [2,10-14]. While the proteasome represents the main degradation mechanism used in cells, some membrane-associated proteins are degraded by the endo-lysosomal pathway, which can be induced by mono-ubiquitination or K63-linked polyubiquitination. In this pathway, ubiquitinated membrane proteins are endocytosed and are then recognized by the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT), which mediate invagination of the endosomal membrane surrounding the ubiquitinated protein. The core ESCRT machinery consists of the ESCRT-I, ESCRT-II and ESCRT-III complexes, ALIX (Apoptosis-Linked gene 2-Interactiong protein X) and VPS4 (Vacuolar Protein Sorting-associated 4). This results in the formation of small vesicles inside the endosome, thereby generating what is called a multivesicular body (MVB). This MVB can then fuse to the lysosome, where the internal vesicles and their associated proteins are degraded [3,15-17]. Viruses 2017, 9, 322 2 of 22 components: the proteasome holoenzymes, several ubiquitin ligases and a large variety of deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) [1]
