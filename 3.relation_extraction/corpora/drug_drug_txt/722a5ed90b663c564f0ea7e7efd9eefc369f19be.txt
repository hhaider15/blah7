The current study aims to assess the main determinants of functional disability of these patients during the follow-up. Fifty-six influenza A (H7N9) survivors were investigated during the 2-year after discharge from the hospital. Results show interstitial change and fibrosis on pulmonary imaging remained 6 months after hospital discharge. Both ventilation and diffusion dysfunction improved, but restrictive and obstructive patterns on ventilation function test persisted throughout the follow-up period. For patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome lung functions improved faster during the first six months. Role-physical and Role-emotional domains in the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey were worse than those of a sex-and age-matched general population group. The quality of life of survivors with ARDS was lower than those with no ARDS. Our findings suggest that pulmonary function and imaging findings improved during the first 6 months especially for those with ARDS, however longterm lung disability and psychological impairment in H7N9 survivors persisted at 2 years after discharge from the hospital.

2|chunk|During the spring of 2013, a novel avian-origin influenza virus emerged. This new virus had a genome similar phylogenetically to that of a chicken A(H7N9) virus isolated from an epidemiologically linked live poultry market 1 and was thus identified as an avian (H7N9) virus 1-3 . H7N9 viruses can cause severe illnesses in persons with contact to poultry, including pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with high case fatality rates 2,4 . As of August 31, 2016, a total of 795 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus had been reported in China 4 . The infections were also detected in the travelers of Canada (two) and Malaysia (one) to China 4 . Although the clinical features of hospitalized patients with H7N9 virus infection are generally similar to those of patients with severe pandemic H1N1 5 or H5N1 virus infections 6 , the mortality rates of H7N9 and H5N1 have been reported to be 37.1% and 53.2%, respectively 7 , whereas that of H1N1 was <1% 5 .

3|chunk|Patients who survive influenza A (H7N9) virus infection are at risk of physical and psychological complications of lung injury and multi-organ dysfunction. However, previous studies have not included prospectively individualized assessments of physiological, functional and quality-of-life measures after hospital discharge to assess the main determinants of functional disability. Therefore, the goal of this study was to assess the long-term changes in pulmonary function and quality of life among patients recovering from H7N9 infection.

4|chunk|Of the 83 patients with H7N9 infection between March 2013 and May 2014, 27 (33.7%) died in the hospital or immediately after discharge. There were a total of 56 patients were enrolled, and the median follow-up interval was 565  158 days. Sixteen (16/56, 28.6%), 30 (30/55, 54.5%), 44 (44/55, 80.0%) and 48 (48/55, 87.2%) patients returned to work within 1, 3, 6 and 12 months, respectively.
