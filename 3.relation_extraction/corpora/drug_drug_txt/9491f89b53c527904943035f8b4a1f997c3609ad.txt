1|chunk|Background: Altered plasma concentrations of vitamin D and mannose binding lectin (MBL), components of innate immunity, have been shown to be associated with the pathogenesis of viral infections. The objective of the present study was to find out whether plasma concentrations of MBL and vitamin D are different in patients with dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF).

2|chunk|The results: The plasma concentrations of vitamin D and MBL were assessed in 48 DF cases, 45 DHF cases and 20 apparently healthy controls using ELISA based methods. Vitamin D concentrations were found to be higher among both DF and DHF cases as compared to healthy controls (P < 0.005 and P < 0.001). Vitamin D concentrations were not different between DF and DHF cases. When the dengue cases were classified into primary and secondary infections, secondary DHF cases had significantly higher concentrations of vitamin D as compared to secondary DF cases (P < 0.050). MBL concentrations were not significantly different between healthy controls and dengue cases. MBL concentrations were observed to be lower in DHF cases as compared to DF cases (P < 0.050). Although MBL levels were not different DF and DHF cases based on immune status, the percentage of primary DHF cases (50%) having MBL levels lower than 500 ng/ml were less compared to primary DF cases (P = 0.038). Conclusions: The present study suggests that higher concentrations of vitamin D might be associated with secondary DHF while deficiency of MBL may be associated with primary DHF.
