1|chunk|Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most important cause of severe acute respiratory tract infection in young children. Alere i RSV is a novel molecular rapid test which identifies respiratory syncytial virus in less than 13 min. Methods: We evaluated the clinical performance of the Alere i RSV assay in a pediatric point-of-care setting during winter season 2016 / 2017. Test results from 518 nasopharyngeal swab samples were compared to a real-time reverse transcription PCR reference standard.

2|chunk|Results: The overall sensitivity and specificity of the Alere i RSV test assay was 93% (CI 95 89% -96%) and 96% (CI 95 93% -98%), respectively. Alere i RSV performed well in children of all age groups. An optimal sensitivity of 98% (CI 95 94% -100%) and specificity of 96% (CI 95 90% -99%) was obtained in children < 6 months. In children  2 years, sensitivity and specificity remained at 87% (CI 95 73% -96%) and 98% (CI 95 92% -100%), respectively. False negative Alere i RSV test results mostly occurred in samples with low viral load (mean CT value 31.1; CI 95 29.6 -32. 6). The Alere i RSV assay is easy to use and can be operated after minimal initial training. Test results are available within 13 min, with most RSV positive samples being identified after approximately 5 min.
