1|chunk|The Finnish new variant of Chlamydia trachomatis (FI-nvCT) is escaping diagnostics in Finland, Norway and Sweden. We have developed and validated an Aptima-format nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) designed specifically to detect the FI-nvCT. This NAAT has high sensitivity (100%) and specificity (100%) for the FI-nvCT strain, enabling further investigation of the geographic distribution, prevalence and transmission of this diagnostic-escape mutant in screening populations in Europe.

2|chunk|In February 2019, investigation of discrepant nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) results led to the discovery of a new genetic variant strain of Chlamydia trachomatis in south-western Finland [1]. This strain, designated Finnish new variant of C. trachomatis (FI-nvCT), harbours a single nt base mutation (C1515T; Escherichia coli numbering) in 23S rRNA. This mutation was determined to be the root cause for compromised detection of the organism by the Aptima Combo 2 (AC2) diagnostic test (Hologic Inc., San Diego, California, United States (US)), which targets C. trachomatis 23S rRNA [2,3]. Archived and newly received clinical specimens in Finland and Sweden with equivocal results or high-negative relative light units (RLU) from 15 to 99 in the AC2 test, and discrepant results between AC2 (target: 23S rRNA) and the separate Aptima Chlamydia trachomatis (ACT) test (target: 16S rRNA) (i.e. AC2 negative/equivocal-ACT positive) signalled the presence of the new strain. Data collected in subsequent investigations suggested a recent emergence of FI-nvCT in south-western Finland, Norway and Sweden with relatively low prevalence (ca 1-6%) among patients with C. trachomatis infections [1,3-5]. We have developed and validated a research-use only Aptima-format surveillance NAAT designed specifically to detect the FI-nvCT strain. This assay should facilitate further investigations to determine the geographic distribution, prevalence and transmission of this diagnostic-escape mutant.

3|chunk|To understand the geographic distribution, prevalence and transmission dynamics of the FI-nvCT strain nationally and internationally, we have developed an Aptima-format NAAT that sensitively and specifically detects FI-nvCT (23S rRNA gene C1515T mutation) but not wild-type (C1515) C. trachomatis strains. This research-use only test uses target capture and transcription-mediated amplification chemistries on the automated Panther instrument (Hologic Inc.) to isolate and amplify C. trachomatis 23S rRNA, and an acridinium ester probe to selectively detect the CT mutation at position 1515.

4|chunk|All validation and verification studies of the new FI-nvCT assay were conducted according to Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) standard protocols used for in vitro diagnostic assay validation [6] . The cut-off value of the test (100,000 RLU) was initially established by testing 454 de-identified remnant clinical specimens obtained from a large reference laboratory in the US. The collection consisted of 266 specimens (endocervical and vaginal swabs, male and female urine, PreservCyt ThinPrep liquid cytology) positive for C. trachomatis by the AC2 assay, and 188 specimens (mixed types) that were AC2-negative
