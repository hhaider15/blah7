0|chunk|Near-Complete Genome Sequence of Infectious Bronchitis Virus Strain VFAR-047 (GI-16 Lineage), Isolated in Peru

1|chunk|Here, we report the near-complete genome sequence of the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) strain VFAR-047, isolated in Peru in 2014. This strain was classified into GI lineage 16 (GI-16) based on both the genome and Spike 1 (S1) sequence analysis. Furthermore, four potential recombination events with other GI-16 and GI-11 strains were identified.
