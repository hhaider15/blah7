1|chunk|Background: Despite the research importance of rhinovirus detection in asymptomatic healthy infants, the literature remains sparse. Objective: To investigate the prevalence of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and rhinovirus (and its species).

2|chunk|We conducted a cross-sectional study of 110 healthy, non-hospitalized infants without acute illness at an academic medical center from November 2013 through May 2014. We tested nasal swab specimens by using polymerase chain reaction and genetic sequencing.

3|chunk|Results: Overall, the median age was 3.8 months (IQR 2.0-5.1 months), 56 % were male, and 90 % were born >37 weeks. RSV was detected in nasal swabs from infants (1.8 %). By contrast, rhinovirus was detected in nasal swabs from 16 infants (14.5 %). Molecular typing assay revealed rhinovirus species: six rhinovirus-A (5.5 %), one rhinovirus-B (0.9 %), eight rhinovirus-C (7.3 %), and one untypeable (0.9 %).

4|chunk|In this cross-sectional study of healthy, community-based infants, RSV was rare (<2 %) in nasal swabs, while rhinovirus was detected in 14.5 % with a predominance of rhinovirus-A and -C. These finding are important for understanding the clinical significance of rhinovirus detection among infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis.
