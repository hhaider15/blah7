1|chunk|Background: Plants and their derived natural compounds possess various biological and therapeutic properties, which turns them into an increasing topic of interest and research. Juniperus genus is diverse in species, with several traditional medicines reported, and rich in natural compounds with potential for development of new drugs. Methods: The research for this review were based in the Scopus and Web of Science databases using terms combining Juniperus, secondary metabolites names, and biological activities. This is not an exhaustive review of Juniperus compounds with biological activities, but rather a critical selection taking into account the following criteria: (i) studies involving the most recent methodologies for quantitative evaluation of biological activities; and (ii) the compounds with the highest number of studies published in the last four years. Results: From Juniperus species, several diterpenes, flavonoids, and one lignan were emphasized taking into account their level of activity against several targets. Antitumor activity is by far the most studied, being followed by antibacterial and antiviral activities. Deoxypodophyllotoxin and one dehydroabietic acid derivative appears to be the most promising lead compounds. Conclusions: This review demonstrates the Juniperus species value as a source of secondary metabolites with relevant pharmaceutical potential.

3|chunk|The extracts and secondary metabolites from Juniperus species exhibit also interesting bioactivities [12, 13] , especially the Juniperus oxycedrus L. and J. communis, two of the most studied species in terms of their phytochemistry, pharmacological, and therapeutic effects [14, 15] . It can be highlighted that extracts and compounds from both plants exhibit antimicrobial, antioxidant, antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, anticonvulsant, analgesic, and cytotoxic activities [14, 15] , and additionally J. communis also possess antifertility, hepatoprotective, diuretic, neuroprotective, antiparasitic, and anti-ulcer properties [14] .

4|chunk|Some of the most relevant studies published in recent years on the bioactivities of Juniperus extracts show clearly that Juniperus continues to be a hot spot in research on natural products as well as contribute to further highlight the pharmacological potential of this genus and of its chemical constituents. For example, Jung et al. [16] reports the butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inhibitory activity of the compound valenc-1(10), 3(4), 11(12)-trien-2-one isolated from Juniperus chinensis L. with an IC 50 value of 68.45 M (IC 50 = 18.75 M for berberine). In Lee and colleagues work [17], Juniperus rigida Siebold & Zucc. fruit ethanol extract was showed to possess anti-atopic properties in in vivo oxazoloneand 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene(DNCB), and induced atopic dermatitis in mice models. It was suggested that the therapeutic effect verified by this extract occurs by decreasing the overproduction of interleukin 4 (IL-4) and immunoglobulin E (IgE) and accelerating skin barrier recovery function. Groshi et al. [18] assessed the cytotoxicity of the polar extract (methanol), and non-polar extracts (dichloromethane and n-hexane) of Juniperus phoenicea L. leaves against four human cancer cell lines concluding that the dichloromethane extract was the most cytotoxic extract against the lung carcinoma cell line A549 (IC 50 = 13 g/mL), while n-hexane extract exhibits the broadest spectrum of activity with IC 50 values of 10, 14, 16, and 40 g/mL against hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2, human breast cancer cell line MCF-7, human lung carcinoma A549, and human bladder carcinoma cell line EJ138, respectively. On the other hand, imbricataloic acid isolated from Juniperus phoenicea var. turbinata (Guss.) Parl. (syn. Juniperus turbinata Guss.) ethanol extract showed the strongest cytotoxic activity (IC 50 values of 0.06, 0.114, and 0.201 M on human colon cancer HCT116, human malignant melanoma A375, and human breast adenocarcinoma MDA-MB-231 cell lines, respectively), being several times more potent than the reference compound cisplatin (IC 50 values of 1.87 to 11.86 M) [19] indicating that imbricataloic acid make a promising anticancer drug candidate.

5|chunk|The essential oil of Juniperus species are also a research target once they exhibit a great diversity of bioactivities. For example, the essential oil of J. phoenicea var. turbinata (syn. Juniperus turbinata Guss.) exhibits cytotoxic effects against HCT116, A375, and MDA-MB-231 human tumor cell lines, in a concentration-dependent inhibitory effect with IC 50 values of 9.48-33.69 g/mL [19] . Juniperus oxycedrus essential oil exhibited high antitrypanosomal activity (IC 50 of 0.9 g/mL) against Trypanosoma brucei brucei, with no cytotoxic effects on RAW 267.4 macrophage cell line showing the highest selectivity index (63.4) [20] . The authors of this study suggest that -pinene would likely be the responsible for the J. oxycedrus essential oil antitrypanosomal properties. In another work using male mice [21] , Juniperus virginiana L. essential oil at 400 and 800 mg/kg showed anxiolytic effect, although it failed to inhibit the anxiety-related behavior by light-dark box.

6|chunk|The interest of the Juniperus species is also at the nutritional/functional food level and some studies, including in vivo studies on this subject, have recently been published. Inci and colleagues [22] found that low supplementation levels of J. communis berry (0.5% and 1%) in Japanese quails (Coturnix coturnix japonica) diets have positive impacts on some body qualities, feed intake, and live weight. Juniperus species are also valuable in terms of their wood since it is a viable construction material classified as durable or even very durable, like J. communis case [23] . In this context, Ate et al. [24] suggest that Juniperus foetidissima Willd. could be aimed for new natural
