1|chunk|When we contract an infection, we typically feel sick and behave accordingly. Symptoms of sickness behavior (SB) include anorexia, hypersomnia, depression, and reduced social interactions. SB affects species spanning from arthropods to vertebrates, is triggered nonspecifically by viruses, bacteria, and parasites, and is orchestrated by a complex network of cytokines and neuroendocrine pathways; clearly, it has been naturally selected. Nonetheless, SB seems evolutionarily costly: it promotes starvation and predation and reduces reproductive opportunities. How could SB persist? Former explanations focused on individual fitness, invoking improved resistance to pathogens. Could prevention of disease transmission, propagating in populations through kin selection, also contribute to SB?

2|chunk|Sickness syndrome is the generalized response of the host to infections. Its classical physiological signs include fever and anemia, but it also includes psychological symptoms-collectively termed "sickness behavior" (SB) [1-3]. These symptoms, familiar to anyone who has been sick, include fatigue, depression, irritability, discomfort, pain, nausea, and loss of interest in food, drink, social interactions, and sex. In animals, such changes can be quantified based on behavior and reflect reprioritization of motivations during disease [2] .

3|chunk|A common misconception is that pathogens directly produce these behavioral symptoms, but in fact SB is orchestrated by the host's immune and neuroendocrine systems; mammals have evolved several parallel pathways to alert the brain of inflammation and trigger symptomatic behaviors (Fig 1) [4, 5] .

4|chunk|Although the specificities may vary, SB is widespread with respect to both pathogens and hosts: diverse pathogens, including viruses, bacteria, and protozoa [1], can trigger it, and equivalent behavioral responses characterize several vertebrate classes [1, 2, 7] as well as arthropods [8, 9] . However, when closely examined, some genera exhibit significant variation in the extent of SB [10], which to date remains unexplained.

5|chunk|Since SB is a conserved phenomenon that is mediated by complex immunological and neuroendocrine pathways, it clearly must have evolutionary benefits. Still, in the last 25 years, much PLOS Biology |
