1|chunk|Background: Human adenoviruses are common causes of community-acquired respiratory tract and enteric infections. Severe disseminated infections with high mortality rates may be seen in immunocompromised individuals. An accurate and cost-effective quantitative assay is essential not only for laboratory diagnosis of adenoviral infections, but also for monitoring of response to antiviral treatment. The diagnostic performance of an in-house quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay was compared to a commercial system. Methods: The analytical sensitivity, specificity, linearity, precision and accuracy of an in-house adenovirus quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay were evaluated against the RealStar Adenovirus PCR Kit (Altona Diagnostics GmbH, Hamburg, Germany), using 122 clinical specimens and 18 proficiency testing samples. Results: Linear regression analysis of the quantitative results by the in-house assay showed the dynamic range from 2.60 to 9 log 10 (plasma) and 2.94 to 9 log 10 (viral transport medium) copies/mL, with the coefficient of determination (R 2 ) of 0.996 and 0.998, respectively. A dilution series demonstrated the limits of detection and lower limits of quantification for plasma were 2.06 log 10 and 2.60 log 10 copies/mL and those for viral transport medium were 2.31 log 10 and 2.94 log 10 copies/mL respectively. The precision of the in-house assay was highly reproducible among runs with coefficients of variance ranging from 0.07 to 3.21% for plasma and 0.17% to 2.11% for viral transport medium. A comparison of 52 matched samples showed an excellent correlation between the quantitative viral loads measured by the in-house assay and the RealStar Adenovirus PCR Kit (R 2 = 0.984), with an average bias of  0.16 log 10 copies/mL. Conclusions: The in-house adenovirus assay is a sensitive and reliable assay with lower cost for the detection and quantification of adenoviral DNA when compared to the RealStar Adenovirus PCR Kit.
