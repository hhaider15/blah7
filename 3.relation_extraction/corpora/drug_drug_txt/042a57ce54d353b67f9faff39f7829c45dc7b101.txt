1|chunk|Objective: To report a case of a patient who required tracheal intubation in a pediatric emergency department due to acute laryngitis and that, after the planned extubation, has successfully used the high-flow nasal cannula, which possibly prevented extubation failure.

2|chunk|Case description: A male 8-month-old child was admitted to the pediatric emergency room with acute respiratory distress due to a high airway obstruction secondary to severe acute laryngitis.

3|chunk|He was immediately intubated and referred to the pediatric intensive care unit. He presented extubation failure due to a significant laryngeal edema evidenced by bronchoscopy. In the second attempt to extubate, he presented respiratory distress, but, after the use of the high-flow nasal cannula, he became stable, reducing the heart and respiratory frequencies, and the extubation was successful.

4|chunk|Comments: The use of the high-flow nasal cannula was effective and presented good response in this patient with acute laryngitis, suggesting that it is a possible adjuvant for the treatment, avoiding worsening respiratory conditions and the need for reintubation.
