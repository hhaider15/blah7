1|chunk|We report the first complete genome sequence of porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) strain CH/Sichuan/S27/2012 identified in feces of diarrheic piglets from mainland China in 2012. This strain has two unique in-frame deletions within the ORF1a gene and is phylogenetically between the prototype PDCoV (HKU15) and the 2014 U.S. strains.
