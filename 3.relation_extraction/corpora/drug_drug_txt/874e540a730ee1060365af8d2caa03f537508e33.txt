1|chunk|Infection by the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causes respiratory illness and has a high mortality rate (~35%). The requirement for the virus to be manipulated in a biosafety level three (BSL-3) facility has impeded development of urgently-needed antiviral agents. Here, we established anovel mouse model by inserting human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (hDPP4) into the Rosa26 locus using CRISPR/Cas9, resulting in global expression of the transgene in a genetically stable mouse line. The mice were highly susceptible to infection by MERS-CoV clinical strain hCoV-EMC, which induced severe diffuse pulmonary disease in the animals, and could also be infected by an optimized pseudotyped MERS-CoV. Administration of the neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, H111-1 and m336, as well as a fusion inhibitor peptide, HR2P-M2, protected mice from challenge with authentic and pseudotyped MERS-CoV. These results confirmed that the hDPP4-knockin mouse is a novel model for studies of MERS-CoV pathogenesis and anti-MERS-CoV antiviral agents in BSL-3 and BSL-2facilities, respectively.

3|chunk|Preclinical animal models that mimic the human pathogenesis of MERS-CoV infection are urgently needed for the development of vaccines and therapies. The classification of MERS-CoV as a biosafety level three (BSL-3) agent is an additional hurdle to progress in this area. Since the emergence of MERS-CoV, several animal species have been evaluated as potential models, including wild-type mice, mice deficient in innate immunity [3], Syrian hamsters [4], ferrets [5] and non-human primates (NHPs) [4, 6] . Two NHPs (rhesus macaques and marmosets) were found to be susceptible to MERS-CoV infection, but other species including mice are naturally non-permissive to infection. Although human DPP4 (hDPP4) has been identified as the receptor for MERS-CoV [7] that mediates infection, mouse DPP4 (mDPP4) is not functional in this respect [8] . Mice adenovirally transduced with hDPP4 could be transiently infected by MERS-CoV but did not develop fatal MERS disease [9] .Moreover, hDPP4-transgenic (Tg) mice expressing hDPP4 under the control of either the cytokeratin 18 promoter [10] or a ubiquitous promoter [11] were susceptible to MERS-CoV infection and developed fatal disease, but also developed unrelated lethal encephalitis. Two knock-in (KI) mice in which mDPP4 was replaced with hDPP4 using CRISPR/Cas9 [8, 12] could be infected by high-titer MERS-CoV isolates but were more susceptible to mouse-adapted MERS-CoV strains. Since mDPP4 is central to normal glucose homeostasis [13] and plays an important role in immunity [14] , altering its sequence may disrupt these functions.

4|chunk|Neutralizing antiviral mAbs are promising candidates for treatment and prevention of MERS-CoV infection [15] . Several highly potent mouse, human and humanized neutralizing mAbs targeting the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) protein have been reported [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] , and antiviral compounds and prophylactic vaccines are also under development. These vaccines and therapeutic agents have typically been evaluated in in vitro systems using MERS-CoV pseudoviruses; however, their efficacy must eventually be confirmed in vivo using a suitable animal model. Several Tg or KI mice susceptible to MERS-CoV are available [9, 11, 12, 21] , and challenge experiments under BSL-3 conditions have been done for the evaluation of potential therapeutics and vaccines.

5|chunk|In this study, we established a novel KI mouse by inserting the full-length hDPP4 gene into the C57BL/6 mouse genome at the Rosa26 locus (used for constitutive, ubiquitous gene expression) using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology. This mouse, termed R26-hDPP4, displayed severe lung disease related to acute respiratory symptoms (ARDS) as well as central nervous system (CNS) involvement after infection with authentic MERS-CoV clinical isolates at low dose. Moreover, high-titer MERS-CoV pseudovirus could also productively infect R26-hDPP4 mice, with effects comparable to those following authentic infection.
