0|chunk|S3 Appendix: Fitting an edge-triangle model to snowball sampled data

1|chunk|We describe here a novel method to fit an edge-triangle model to snowball sample data. Let D u , S u and T u be the node degree, number of stubs and triangle corners at node u from an observed snowball sample. Without additional node roles we must have D u = S u +2T u . Our approach is to use an estimator p(d) of the network degree distribution

2|chunk|where M is the maximum node degree in the network, and an estimatorp j|d of the conditional triangle corner distribution p j|d = P (T u = j|D u = d).

3|chunk|We use a distribution conditional on node degree because empirical networks have been shown to exhibit negative correlation between a node's degree and its number of incident triangles [1].

4|chunk|To simulate an edge-triangle network with N nodes we perform the following steps.
