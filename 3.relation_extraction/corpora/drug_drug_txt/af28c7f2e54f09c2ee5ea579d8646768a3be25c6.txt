1|chunk|The virome of insectivorous bat feces has been shown to consist largely of insect viruses, followed by plant viruses, reflecting the insect-based diet of these bats, and plant-based diet of these insects [1-3].

2|chunk|Conversely, our study, based on the analysis of tissue samples, led to the detection of only a few new insect viruses, and even fewer new plant viruses.

3|chunk|Based on BLASTx and BLASTn analyses, numerous read and contig sequences from pooled bat samples were identified as taxonomically related to families of viruses infecting invertebrates, mostly the Polydnaviridae, Baculoviridae, Dicistroviridae and Nodaviridae. For the last two of these families, we were able to identify and confirm the presence of putative new insect viruses, in bat specimens b2 (Pipistrellus pipistrellus) and b7 (Eptesicus serotinus), respectively.
