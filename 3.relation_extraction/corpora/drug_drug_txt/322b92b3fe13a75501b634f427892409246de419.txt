1|chunk|Background: Bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) is an important respiratory pathogen worldwide, detrimentally affecting the economy and animal welfare. To prevent and control BRSV infection, further knowledge on virus shedding and transmission potential in individual animals is required. This study aimed to detect viral RNA and infective virions during BRSV infection to evaluate duration of the transmission period and correlation with clinical signs of disease. The outcome of BRSV re-exposure on calves, their housing environment and effect of introduction of sentinel calves was also investigated. A live animal experiment including 10 calves was conducted over 61 days. Initially, two calves were inoculated with a non-passaged BRSV field isolate. Two days later, six nave calves (EG: Exposed group) were introduced for commingling and four weeks later, another two nave calves (SG: Sentinel group) were introduced. Seven weeks after commingling, EG animals were re-inoculated. Clinical examination was performed daily. Nasal swabs were collected regularly and analysed for viral RNA by RT-ddPCR, while virus isolation was performed in cell culture. BRSV serology was performed with ELISA.

2|chunk|Results: All the EG calves seroconverted and showed clinical signs of respiratory disease. Viral RNA was detected from days 1-27 after exposure, while the infective virus was isolated on day 6 and 13. On day 19, all animals were seropositive and virus could not be isolated. Total clinical score for respiratory signs corresponded well with the shedding of viral RNA. The SG animals, introduced 27 days after exposure, remained negative for BRSV RNA and stayed seronegative throughout the study. Inoculation of the EG calves seven weeks after primary infection did not lead to new shedding of viral RNA or clinical signs of disease.

3|chunk|Conclusion: Viral RNA was detected in nasal swabs from the calves up to four weeks after exposure. The detection and amount of viral RNA corresponded well with the degree of respiratory signs. The calves were shedding infective virions for a considerable shorter period, and nave calves introduced after four weeks were not infected. Infected calves were protected from reinfection for at least seven weeks. This knowledge is useful to prevent spread of BRSV.
