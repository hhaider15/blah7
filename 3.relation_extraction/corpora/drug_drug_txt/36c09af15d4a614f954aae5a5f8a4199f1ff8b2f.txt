1|chunk|Despite several immunization efforts, China saw a resurgence of measles in 2012. Monitoring of transmissions of individuals from different age groups could offer information that would be valuable for planning adequate disease control strategies. We compared the agespecific effective reproductive numbers (R) of measles during

2|chunk|We estimated the age-specific R values for 7 age groups: 0-8 months, 9-18 months, 19 months to 6 years, 7-15 years, 16-25 years, 26-45 years, and !46 years adapting the contact matrix of China. The daily numbers of laboratory and clinically confirmed cases reported to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention of Guangdong were used.

3|chunk|The peak R values of the entire population were above unity from 2012 to 2016, indicating the persistence of measles in the population. In general, children aged 0-6 years and adults aged 26-45 years had larger values of R when comparing with other age groups after 2012. While the peaks of R values for children aged 0-6 years dropped steadily after 2013, the peaks of R values for adults aged 26-45 years kept at a high range every year.

4|chunk|Although the provincial supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) conducted in 2009 and 2010 were able to reduce the transmissions from 2009 to 2011, larger values of R for children aged 0-6 years were observed after 2012, indicating that the benefits of the SIAs were short-lived. In addition, the transmissions from adults aged between 26 and 45 years PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.
