1|chunk|A. The basic reproduction number R 0 of system (1)

2|chunk|Through simple calculation, we can obtain a disease free equilibrium E 1 = (S 1 , 0, 0, 0, 0, R 1 ). Then we use the spectral radius of the next generation matrix (the method proposed by the Van Den Driessche in [1]) to get the expression of R 0 of system (1) . Firstly, only the infected compartments satisfied by the following system are considered:
