  <chunk id="32520291_en.c1" text="This paper aims to perform a theoretical reflection on the historical-social foundations of the COVID-19 pandemic. The &quot;capital worldization&quot;, &quot;capital-imperialism&quot;, &quot;space-time compression&quot;, and &quot;structural crisis of capital&quot; categories are conjured from the historical materialistic-theoretical matrix, outlining a course that transcends the limits of Health Sciences to understand global health, of which the COVID-19 pandemic is an expression. We then return to the field of health, when the category of &quot;social determination of health&quot; allows elucidating the bases of the pandemic studied. We show that, other elements typical of the current phase of contemporary capitalism have become universal besides the SARS-CoV-2 characteristics or the dynamics of the rapid movement of people and objects around the world, unifying the health social determination process."/>
