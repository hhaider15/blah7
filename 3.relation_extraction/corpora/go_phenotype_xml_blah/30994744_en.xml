  <chunk id="30994744_en.c1" text="HIV prevalence among transgender women is disproportional when compared to the general population in various countries. Stigma and discrimination based on gender identity have frequently been associated with vulnerability to HIV/AIDS. The objective was to conduct a systematic literature review to analyze the relationship between stigma and discrimination related to gender identity in transgender women and vulnerability to HIV/AIDS. This systematic literature review involved the stages of identification, compilation, analysis, and interpretation of results of studies found in five databases: PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Science Direct, and LILACS. No publication time period was determined in advance for this review. The studies were assessed according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The review included articles in English, Portuguese, or Spanish that related stigma and discrimination to transgender women's vulnerability to HIV. We found 41 studies, mostly qualitative, published from 2004 to 2018, and categorized in three dimensions of stigma: individual, interpersonal, and structural. The data highlighted that the effects of stigma related to gender identity, such as violence, discrimination, and transphobia, are structuring elements in transgender women's vulnerability to HIV/AIDS. The studies showed a relationship between stigma and discrimination and transgender women's vulnerability to HIV/AIDS and indicated the need for public policies to fight discrimination in society.">
