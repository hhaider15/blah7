  <chunk id="32159629_en.c1" text="To characterize spatiotemporal patterns of operational indicators for leprosy control in the state of Bahia from 2001 to 2014.This is a population-based ecological study, with spatial distribution and autocorrelation of operational indicators for leprosy control.From 2001 to 2007, 42.7% (n=178) of the municipalities presented a cure rate lower than 75%, increasing to 61.4% (n =291) from 2009 to 2014. Between 2001 and 2007, 32.5% (n=54) of the municipalities reported more than 10% of the total number of relapses in the state, increasing to 36.9% (n=75) between 2008 and 2014. From 2001 to 2014, 38% (n=159) of the municipalities presented an assessment index of disability grading at the time of diagnosis within the regular performance parameter. Between 2009 and 2014, the number of municipalities with a high incidence of grade 2 disability (G2D) at the time of diagnosis increased, reaching 55.3% (n=230) of the municipalities. Most municipalities in the state of Bahia showed poor performance in the implementation of planned actions for leprosy control, with little change or relative worsening in the patterns of operational indicators throughout the historical series.The operational context in Bahia indicates significant institutional vulnerability, leading to the need for expansion and qualification of the surveillance and health care network in the different regions and conditions analyzed in the public health system (Sistema Único de Saúde - SUS)."/>
