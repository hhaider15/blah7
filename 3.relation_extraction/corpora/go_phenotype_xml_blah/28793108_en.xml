  <chunk id="28793108_en.c1" text="To describe the process of manufacturing and validation of an educational booklet for HIV/Aids prevention in older adults.Methodological study developed in two phases - manufacturing of the booklet and validation of the educational material by judges. The manufacturing process involved a situational diagnosis with older adults, and its result indicated gaps in the knowledge with respect to HIV/Aids. The validation process was performed by nine judges, selected by convenience. It was considered an agreement index of at least 0.80, analyzed through the content validity index.We opted for a dialogue between two older adults divided into three categories: myths and taboos; ignorance; and prevention and importance of diagnosis. The average of the items was 0.90. The suggestions made by the judges were observed and modified for the final version.The material had relevant content for the judges, in addition to being able to be used by health professionals in the education and clarification of issues on the subject."/>
