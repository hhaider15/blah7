  <chunk id="31508759_en.c1" text="This paper aims to evaluate the effectiveness of telephone use for the adherence of people with HIV/AIDS to antiretroviral therapy. A systematic review was carried out in the following databases: Latin American and Caribbean Literature in Health Sciences (Lilacs/ Bireme), SCOPUS, Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE/PubMed), Web of Science; and in the Scientific Electronic Library Online (SciELO) and Cochrane libraries, using the following descriptors: &quot;HIV&quot;, &quot;Cell Phones&quot;, &quot;Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome&quot; and &quot;Antiretroviral Therapy, Highly Active&quot;. We gathered a sample of 17 papers. The proposed cellphone interventions were the use of cellular applications, Short Message Service, and telephone calls. In most studies, telephone use has had a significant impact on adherence to treatment. The evaluation of the studies showed good methodological quality and adequate allocation secrecy. Self-reported adherence emerged among the adherence measuring methods. Cellphone use was effective in improving adherence to antiretroviral therapy for people living with HIV.">
