  <chunk id="31859725_en.c1" text="to evaluate the safety profile and aesthetic results of 2-octyl-cyanoacrylate versus intradermal nylon suture in breast surgeries.an open-label, randomized, clinical trial evaluating the occurrence of complications, such as dehiscence, hematoma, infection, and allergic reactions after the use of 2-octyl-cyanoacrylate or nylon thread. The size of the incisions, skin closure time, and total surgical time were also analyzed. The aesthetic outcome was evaluated at 40 and 180 days after surgery, by means of the average width of the surgical wound and by subjective conceptual assessment (optimal, good, reasonable, or poor).79 patients were included: 37 in the 2-octyl-cyanoacrylate group and 42 in the nylon suture group. The study was stopped before the end of patient recruitment due to the occurrence of a greater number of dehiscences in the adhesive group (OR: 11.42; 95%CI: 1.36-96.02; p=0.007). Regarding the other analyzed complications, the surgical duration and postoperative aesthetic result, no significant differences were observed between the groups. The mean operative wound size was greater in the adhesive group than in the suture group, but there was no correlation between wound size and the largest number of dehiscences.while the cosmetic outcomes with the two techniques were similar, there was a greater risk of dehiscence with the use of 2-octyl-cyanoacrylate compared to intradermal suturing.">
