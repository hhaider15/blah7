  <chunk id="33084835_en.c1" text="Adverse events pose a serious problem for quality of healthcare. Dental practice is eminently invasive and involves close and routine contact with secretions; as such, it is potentially prone to the occurrence of adverse events. Various patient safety studies have been developed in the last two decades, but mostly in the hospital setting due to the organizational complexity, severity of the cases, and diversity and specificity of the procedures. The objective was to identify and explore studies on patient safety in Dentistry. An integrative literature review was performed in MEDLINE via PubMed, Scopus via Portal Capes, and the Regional Portal of the Virtual Health Library, using the terms patient safety and dentistry in English, Spanish, and Portuguese, starting in 2000. The research cycle in patient safety was used, as proposed by the World Health Organization to classify studies. We analyzed 91 articles. The most common adverse events were allergies, infections, diagnostic delay or failure, and technical error. Measures to mitigate the problem highlight the need to improve communications, encourage reporting, and search for tools to assist the management of care. The authors found a lack of studies on implementation and assessment of the impact of proposals for improvement. Dentistry has made progress in patient safety but still needs to transpose the results into practice, where efforts are crucial to prevent adverse events.">
