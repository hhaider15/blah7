  <chunk id="31389477_en.c1" text="To identify the population's knowledge of the terms &quot;sepsis&quot; and &quot;acute myocardial infarction&quot; (AMI).Cross-sectional quantitative study. Data was collected through the application of a questionnaire to two groups of participants, as follows: individuals who visit parks in Porto Alegre, State of Rio Grande do Sul and companions of patients of a university hospital in Porto Alegre. Analysis of the results was performed by descriptive and inferential statistics. RESULTSThe sample consisted of 1,986 respondents: 1,455 parkgoers and 531 companions of patients admitted to the hospital. Regarding the knowledge of sepsis, only 19.1% of the respondents had already heard about the subject. However, compared to knowledge about AMI, it was found that 98.7% knew the term.The study found that the scarce knowledge of the population about the term &quot;sepsis&quot; is related to the social level of the respondents, demonstrating poor access to information about health care."/>
