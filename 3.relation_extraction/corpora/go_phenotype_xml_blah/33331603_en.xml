The time interval between symptom onset and testing was compared using the ANOVA test, classifying it according to test adequacy/timeliness.Taking 1,942,514 notifications, average time between symptom onset and testing was 10.2 days (Â±17.1). Among those tested, females (55.1%), people aged 20-39 years (43.8%), and the Southeast region of Brazil (43.0%) predominated. 58.8% of IgM ELISA tests were performed at an adequate time while 68.0% of rapid antigen tests were not performed at an adequate time.Inadequacy was found between symptom onset and time taken to test for COVID-19 in the Brazilian regions.">
