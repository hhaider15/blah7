  <chunk id="30365861_en.c1" text="At age 44, after suffering a breakdown in Turin, philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche was diagnosed with neurosyphilis. There was no necropsy on his body, so this medical diagnosis has been questioned over the time. We conducted a literature review on the medical diagnosis of Nietzsche, which emphasizes three genres of pathographies that emerged successively as alternatives explanations for Nietzsche's breakdown in Turin: (1) narratives about syphilis (&quot;demoniac-pathological&quot;); (2) narratives about functional psychosis (&quot;heroic-prophetic&quot;); (3) other narratives about organic diseases, other than syphilis (&quot;scientific-realistic&quot;). The latter - which correspond to our study object in this work - undertake retrospective diagnostics, attempting to retrieve the &quot;truth&quot; underlying the disease and elucidate &quot;Nietzsche's affair&quot;. We inquire this detective-like impetus, currently taken to the extreme by &quot;evidence-based medicine&quot;, and we denounce its anachronism. Syphilis has become a scientific fact only after the death of Nietzsche. We conclude that the diagnosis he received is shown to be consistent with the nineteenth-century medical rationality and the syphilis status as a cultural fact at that time."/>
