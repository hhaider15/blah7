  <chunk id="33084797_en.c1" text="To investigate the association between intensive nursing staff's work conditions and the occurrence of adverse events in patients.Evaluative documentary study conducted in six public neonatal and pediatric Intensive Care Units from hospitals in ParanÃ¡ state, from April 2017 to January 2018. The predictive variables concerning staff sizing and work environment were measured through the instruments Nursing Activities Score and Brazilian Nursing Work Index-Revised. The thirty adverse events corresponded to the outcome variable and were detected using the instruments Pediatric and Neonatal Trigger Tool.Two-hundred and three professionals participated in this research. The nursing staff sizing was verified to be appropriate. Work conditions were favorable and Cronbach's Alpha was 0.90 (IC= 0.87 - 0.92). The most frequently detected events in patients were infection and skin lesion. The statistical analysis of correlation and adverse event occurrence was not significant.Despite the lack of evidence on statistical significance between the variables, the results reveal commitment by the public sector and professionals with patient safety and assistance quality.">
